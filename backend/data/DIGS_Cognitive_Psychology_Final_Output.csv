In the five years since the fifth edition of 
this textbook was published, there have been 

numerous exciting developments in our under-

standing of human cognition. Of greatest 

importance, large numbers of brain-imaging 

studies are revolutionising our knowledge 

rather than just providing us with pretty 

coloured pictures of the brain in action. As a 

consequence, the leading contempo"
Segment_4,"rary approach   to human cognition involves studying the  brain   as well as  behaviour . We have used the term   ﬁcognitive psychologyﬂ in the title of this book   to refer to this approach, which forms the basis   for our coverage of human cognition. Note,   however, that the term ﬁcognitive neuro",Explores how perception influences cognition.,"attention, perception, recognition",Nested under Chapter on awareness,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in memory,Aligned with contemporary studies on recognition,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_150,"rary approach 

to human cognition involves studying the

as well as 
behaviour
. We have used the term 

ﬁcognitive psychologyﬂ in the title of this book 

to refer to this approach, which forms the basis 

for our coverage of human cognition. Note, 

however, that the term ﬁcognitive neuroscienceﬂ 

is often used to describe this approach.
The approaches to human cognition covered 
in this book are more varied than has been 

suggested so far. For example, one approach 

involves mainly laboratory studies on healthy 

individuals, and another approach (cognitive 

neuropsychology) involves focusing on the 

effects of brain damage on cognition. There is 

also computational cognitive science, which 

involves developing computational models of 

human cognition.
We have done our level best in this book 
to identify and discuss the most signi˚
 cant 
research and theorising stemming from the above 

approaches and to integrate all of this informa-

tion. Whether we have succeeded is up to our 

readers to decide. As was the case with previous  

editions of this textbook, both authors have 

had to work hard to keep pace with developments 
in theory and research. For example, the ˚
 rst 
author wrote parts of the book in far-˜
 ung places 
including Macau, Iceland, Istanbul, Hong Kong, 

Southern India, and the Dominican Republic. 

Sadly, there have been several occasions on 

which book writing has had to take precedence 

over sightseeing!
I (Michael Eysenck) would like to express 
my continuing profound gratitude to my wife 

Christine, to whom this book (in common with 

the previous three editions) is appropriately 

dedicated. What she and our three children 
(Fleur, 

William, and Juliet) have added to my life is 

too immense to be captured by mere words.
I (Mark Keane) would like to thank everyone 
at the Psychology Press for their extremely friendly 

and ef˚ cient contributions to the production 

of this book, including Mike Forster, Lucy

between cognitive psychology and cognitive 
neuroscience is often blurred Œ the term ﬁcognitive 

psychologyﬂ can be used in a broader sense to 

include cognitive neuroscience. Indeed, it is in 

that broader sense that it is used in the title of 

this book.
There are several ways in which cognitive 
neuroscientists explore human cognition. First,  

there are brain-imaging techniques, of which 

PET (
positron emission tomography
) and fMRI 

(
functional magnetic resonance imaging
) (both 
discussed in detail later) are probably the best 

known. Second, there are electrophysiological 

techniques involving the recording of electrical 
INTRODUCTION
We are now several years into the third millennium,  

and there is more interest than ever in unravelling 

the mysteries of the human brain and mind. 

This interest is re˜ ected in the recent upsurge 

of scienti˚ c research within cognitive psychology 

and cognitive neuroscience. We will start with 

cognitive psychology. It is concerned with the 

internal processes involved in making sense 

of the environment, and deciding what action 

might be appropriate. These processes include 

attention, perception, learning, memory, language, 

problem solving, reasonin"

The aims of cognitive neuroscientists are 
often similar to those of cognitive psychologists.  

However, there is one important difference Œ 

cognitive neuroscientists argue convincingly 

that we need to study the 
brain
 as well as 

behaviour while people engage in cognitive 

tasks. After all, the internal processes involved 

in human cognition occur in the brain, and we 

have increasingly sophisticated ways of studying 

the brain in action. We can de˚

cognitive 
neuroscience
 as involving the attempt to use 

information about behaviour and about the 

brain to understand human cognition. As is well 

known, cognitive neuroscientists use brain-

imaging techniques. Note that the distinction

EXPERIMENTAL 
COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY
It is almost as pointless to ask, ﬁWhen did 
cognitive psychology start?ﬂ as to inquire, 

ﬁHow long is a piece of string?ﬂ However, 

the year 1956 was of crucial importance. At 

ameeting at the Massachusetts Institute of 

Technology, Noam Chomsky gave a paper on 

his theory of language, George Miller discussed 

the magic number seven in short-term memory 

(Miller, 1956), and Newell and Simon discussed 

their extremely in˜ uential model called the 

General Problem Solver (see Newell, Shaw, & 

Simon, 1958). In addition, there was the ˚
 rst 
systematic attempt to study concept formation 

from a cognitive perspective (Bruner, Goodnow, 

& Austin, 1956).
At one time, most cognitive psycholo-
gists subscribed to the information-processing 

approach. A 
version of this approach popular 

in the 1970s is shown in Figure 1.1. According 

to this version, a stimulus (an environmental 

event such as a problem or a task) is presented. 

This stimulus causes certain internal cognitive 

processes to occur, and these processes ˚
 nally 
produce the desired response or answer. Processing 

directly affected by the stimulus input is often 

described as 
bottom-up processing
. It was 

typically assumed that only one process occurs 
signals generated by the brain (also discussed 

later). Third, many cognitive neuroscientists 

study the effects of brain damage on human 

cognition. It is assumed that the patterns of 

cognitive impairment shown by brain-damaged 

patients can tell us much about normal cognitive 

functioning and about the brain areas responsible 

for different cognitive processes.
The huge increase in scienti˚ c interest in the 
workings of the brain is mirrored in the popular 

media Œ numerous books, ˚ lms, and television 

programmes have been devoted to the more 

accessible and/or dramatic aspects of cog"

Increasingly, media coverage   includes  coloured pictures of the brain, showing  clearly which parts of the  brain are most  activated  when people perform  various tasks.

phrase (i.e., top-down processing) dominated 
the information actually available from the 

stimulus (i.e., bottom-up processing).
The traditional approach was also over-
simpli˚
 ed in assuming that processing is 
typically serial. In fact, there are numerous 

situations in which some (or all) of the processes

time Œ this is known as 
parallel processing
. It 

is often hard to know whether processing on 

a given task is serial or parallel. However, we 

are much more likely to use parallel processing 

when performing a task on which we are highly 

practised than one we are just starting to learn 

(see Chapter 5). For example, someone taking 

their ˚ rst driving lesson ˚ nds it almost impossible 

to change gear, to steer accurately, and to pay 

attention to other road users at the same time. 

In contrast, an experienced driver ˚
 nds it easy 
and can even hold a conversation as well.
For many years, nearly all research on human 
cognition involved carrying out experiments on 

healthy individuals under laboratory conditions. 

Such experiments are typically tightly controlled 

and ﬁscienti˚ cﬂ. Researchers have shown great 

ingenuity in designing experiments to reveal 

the processes involved in attention, perception, 

learning, memory, reasoning, and so on. As a 

consequence, the ˚ ndings of cognitive psycholo-

gists have had 
a major in˜ uence on the research 
conducted by cognitive neuroscientists. Indeed, 

as we will see, nearly all the research discussed 

in this book owes much to the cognitive psycho-

logical approach.
An important issue that cognitive psychol-
ogists have addressed is the task impurity 
at any moment in time. This is known as 
serial 
processing
, meaning that the current process 

is completed before the next one starts.
The above approach represents a drastic 
oversimpli˚
 cation of a complex reality. There 
are numerous situations in which processing 

is not exclusively bottom-up but also involves 

top-down processing. 
Top-down processing
 

is processing in˜ uenced by the individual™s 

expectations and knowledge rather than simply 

by the stimulus itself. Look at the triangle shown 

in Figure 1.2 and read what it says. Unless you 

are familiar with the trick, you probably read

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
Finally, the selection of tasks by cognitive 
neuroscientists for their brain-imaging studies 

is in˜ uenced by the theoretical and empirical 

efforts of cognitive psychologists.
Limitations
In spite of cognitive psychology™s enormous 

contributions to our knowledge of human 

cognition, the approach has various limitations. 

We will brie˜ y consider ˚ ve such limitations 

here. First, how people behave in the laboratory 

may differ from how they behave in everyday 

life. The concern is that laboratory research 

lacks 
ecological validity
 Œ the extent to which 
problem Œ many cognitive tasks involve the 

use of a complex mixture of different processes, 

making it hard to interpret the ˚
 ndings. This 
issue has been addressed in various ways. 

For example, suppose we are interested in the 

inhibitory processes used when a task requires 

us to inhibit deliberately some dominant response. 

Miyake, Friedman, Emerson, Witzki, Howerter, 

and Wager (2000) studied three tasks that 

require such inhibitory processes: the Stroop 

task; the anti-saccade task; and the s"
Segment_11,"top-signal   task. On the Stroop task, participants have to   name the colour in which colour words are   presented (e.g., RED printed in green) and   avoid saying the colour word. We are so used   to reading words that it is hard to inhibit   responding with the colour word.

task. On the Stroop task, participants have to 

name the colour in which colour words are 

presented (e.g., RED printed in green) and 

avoid saying the colour word. We are so used 

to reading words that it is hard to inhibit 

responding with the colour word. On the anti-

saccade task, a visual cue is presented to the left 

or right of the participant. The task involves 
not
 
looking at the cue but, rather, inhibiting that 

response and looking in the opposite direction. 

On the stop-signal task, participants have to 

categorise words as animal or non-animal as 

rapidly as possible, but must inhibit their response 

when a tone sounds. Miyake et al. obtained 

evidence that these three tasks all involved 

similar processes. They used a statistical pro-

cedure known as latent-variable analysis to 

extract what was common to the three tasks, 

which was assumed to represent a relatively 

pure measure of the inhibitory process.
Cognitive psychology was for many years 
the engine room of progress in understanding 

human cognition, and all the other approaches 

listed in the box above have derived substantial 

bene˚
t from it. For example, 
cognitive neuro-
psychology
 became an important approach 

about 20 years after cognitive psychology. It 

was only when cognitive psychologists had 

developed reasonable accounts of normal human  

cognition that the performance of brain-damaged 

patients could be understood properly. Before 

that, it was hard to decide which patterns 

of cognitive impairment were of theoretical 

importance. Similarly, the computational model-

ling activities of computational cognitive 

scientists are often informed to a large extent 

by pre-computational psychological theories.

system. Various candidate cognitive architectures 
have been proposed (e.g., Anderson™s Adaptive 

Control of Thought-Rational (ACT-R ) model; 

discussed later in the chapter). However, the 

research community has not abandoned speci˚
 c 
theories in favour of using cognitive architectures, 

because researchers are not convinced that any 

of them is the ﬁone true cognitive architectureﬂ.
COGNITIVE 
NEUROSCIENCE: 

THE BRAIN IN ACTION
As indicated earlier, cognitive neuroscience 
involves intensive study of the brain as well as 

behaviour. Alas, the brain is complicated (to 

put it mildly!). It consists of about 50 billion 

neurons, each of which can connect with up 

to about 10,000 other neurons.
To understand research involving functional 
neuroimaging, we must consider how the brain 

is organised and how the different areas are 

described. Various ways of describing speci˚
 c 
brain areas are used. We will discuss two of 

the main ways. First, the cerebral cortex is 

divided into four main divisions or lobes (see 

Figure 1.3). There are four lobes in each brain 

hemisphere: frontal, parietal, temporal, and 

occipital. The frontal lobes are divided from 

the parietal lobes by the central sulcus (
sulcus
 

means furrow or groove), the lateral ˚
 ssure 
separates the temporal lobes from the parietal 

and frontal lobes, and the parieto-occipital sulcus 

and pre-occipital notch divide the occipital lobes 

from the parietal and temporal lobes. The main 
the ˚ ndings of laboratory studies are applicable 

to everyday life. In most laboratory research, 

for example, the sequence of stimuli presented 

to t"

predetermined plan and is not in˜
 uenced by 
the participant™s behaviour. This is very different 

to everyday life, in which we often change the 

situation to suit ourselves.
Second, cognitive psychologists typically 
obtain measures of the speed and accuracy of 

task performance. These measures provide only 

indirect
 evidence about the internal processes 

involved in cognition. For example, it is often 

hard to decide whether the processes underlying 

performance on a complex task occur one at 

a time (serial processing), with some overlap 

in time (cascade processing), or all at the same 

time (parallel processing). As we will see, the 

brain-imaging techniques used by cognitive neuro-

scientists can often clarify what is happening.
Third, cognitive psychologists have often 
put forward theories expressed only in verbal 

terms. Such theories tend to be vague, making 

it hard to know precisely what predictions 

follow from them. This limitation can largely 

be overcome by developing computer models 

specifying in detail the assumptions of any 

given theory. This is how computational cognitive 

scientists (and, before them, developers of math-

ematical models) have contributed to cognitive 

psychology.
Fourth, the ˚ ndings obtained using any 
given experimental task or 
paradigm are some-
times speci˚ c to that paradigm and do not 

generalise to other (apparently similar) tasks. 

This is 
paradigm speciÞ
 city
, and it means that 
some of the ˚ ndings in cognitive psychology 

are narrow in scope. There has been relatively 

little research in this area, and so we do not know 

whether the problem of paradigm speci˚
 city is 
widespread.
Fifth, much of the emphasis within cognitive 
psychology has been on relatively speci˚
 c 
theories applicable only to a narrow range of 

cognitive tasks. What has been lacking is a 

comprehensive theoretical architecture. Such 

an architecture would clarify"

the pattern of electrical brain activity

Positron emission tomography (PET)
¥
: 
This technique involves the detection of 

positrons, which are the atomic particles 

emitted from some radioactive substances. 

PET has reasonable spatial resolution but poor 

temporal resolution, and it only provides an 

indirect measure of neural activity.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging

later). fMRI has superior spatial and temporal  

resolution to PET, but also only provides an

tionally distinct areas. We will often refer to 

areas such as BA17, which simply means 

Brodmann Area 17.
Techniques for studying the brain
Technological advances mean we have numerous 

exciting ways of obtaining detailed information 

about the brain™s functioning and structure. In 

principle, we can work out 
where
 and 
when
 in 

the brain speci˚ c cognitive processes occur. Such 

information allows us to determine the order 

in which different parts of the brain become 

active when someone performs a task. It also 

allows us to ˚ nd out whether two tasks involve 
the same parts of the brain in the same way 

or whether there are important differences.
Information concerning techniques for 
studying brain activity is contained in the box 

below. Which of these techniques is the best? 

There is no single (or simple) answer. Each 

technique has its own strengths and limitations, 

and so researchers focus on matching the 

technique to the issue they want to address. 

At the most basic level, the various techniques 

vary in the precision with which they identify 

the brain areas active when a task is performed 

(spatial resolution), and the time course of 

such activation (temporal resolution). Thus, 

the techniques differ in their ability to provide 

precise information concerning where and

Event-related potentials
The 
electroencephalogram (EEG)
 is based on 
recordings of electrical brain activity measured 

at the surface of the scalp. Very small changes 

in electrical activity within the brain are picked 

up by scalp electrodes. These changes can be 

shown on the screen of a cathode-ray tube 

using an oscilloscope. However, spontaneous 

or background brain activity sometimes obscures 

the impact of stimulus processing on the EEG 
when brain activity occurs. The spatial and 

temporal resolutions of various techniques are 

shown in Figure 1.5. High spatial and temporal 

resolutions are advantageous if a very detailed 

account of brain functioning is required. In 

contrast, low temporal resolution can be more 

useful if a general overview of brain activity 

during an entire task is needed.
We have introduced the main techniques 
for studying the brain. In what follows, we 

consider each of them in more detail.
Single-unit recording
As indicated already, 
single-unit recording
 

permits the study of single neurons. One of the 

best-known applications of this technique was 

by Hubel and Wiesel (1962, 1979) in research 

on the neurophysiology of basic visual processes  

in cats and monkeys. They found simple and 

complex cells in the primary visual cortex, both 

of which responded maximally to straight-line 

stimuli in a particular orientation (see Chapter 

2). Hubel and Wiesel™s ˚ ndings were so clear-

cut that they in˜ uenced several subsequent 

theories of visual perception (e.g., Marr, 

1982).
The single-unit (or cell) recording technique 
is more fine-grain than other techniques. 

Another advantage is that information about

are mainly of value when stimuli are simple 
and the task involves basic processes (e.g., 

target detection) occurring at a certain time 

after stimulus onset. For example, it would not 

be feasible to study most complex forms of 

cognition (e.g., problem solving) with ERPs.
Positron emission tomography (PET)
Positron emission tomography is based on the 

detection of positrons, which are the atomic 

particles emitted by some radioactive substances. 

Radioactively labelled water (the tracer) is 

injected into the body, and rapidly gathers in 

the brain™s blood vessels. When part of the 

cortex becomes active, the labelled water moves 

rapidly to that place. A scanning device next 

measures the positrons emitted from the 

radioactive water. A computer then translates 

this information into pictures of the activity 

levels in different brain regions. It may sound 

dangerous to inject a radioactive substance. 

However, tiny amounts of radioactivity are 

involved, and the tracer has a half-life of only 

2 minutes, although it takes 10 minutes for the 

tracer to decay almost completely.
PET has reasonable spatial resolution, in 
that any active area within the brain can be 

located to with"
Segment_19,"in 5Œ10 millimetres. However,   it suffers from various limitations. First, it has   very poor temporal resolution. PET scans indicate   the amount of activity in each region of the   brain over a period of 30Œ60 seconds. PET   cannot assess the rapid changes in brain activity   associated with most",Explores how memory influences cognition.,"attention, recognition, emotion",Nested under Chapter on perception,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in awareness,Aligned with contemporary studies on awareness,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_1078,"in 5Œ10 millimetres. However, 

it suffers from various limitations. First, it has 

very poor temporal resolution. PET scans indicate 

the amount of activity in each region of the 

brain over a period of 30Œ60 seconds. PET 

cannot assess the rapid changes in brain activity 

associated with most cognitive processes. 

Second, PET provides only an 
indirect
 meas-

ure of neural activity. As Anderson, Holliday, 

Singh, 
and Harding (1996, p. 423) pointed 
out, 
ﬁChanges in regional cerebral blood ˜
 ow, 
re˜
 ected by changes in the spatial distribution 
of intravenously administered positron emitted  
recording. This problem can be solved by 

presenting the same stimulus several times. 

After that, the segment of EEG following each 

stimulus is extracted and lined up with respect 

to the time of stimulus onset. These EEG segments 

are then simply averaged together to produce a  

single waveform. This method produces 
event-

related potentials (ERPs)
 from EEG recordings 
and allows us to distinguish genuine effects of 

stimulation from background brain activity.
ERPs have very limited spatial resolution 
but their temporal resolution is excellent. Indeed, 

they can often indicate when a given process 

occurred to within a few milliseconds. The ERP 

waveform consists of a series of positive (P) and 

negative (N) peaks, each described with reference 

to the time in milliseconds after stimulus presen-

tation. Thus, for example, 
N400 is a negative 

wave peaking at about 400 ms.
Here is an example showing the value of 
ERPs in resolving theoretical controversies 

(discussed more fully in Chapter 10). It has 

often been claimed that readers take longer to 

detect semantic mismatches in a sentence when  

detection of the mismatch requires the use of 

world knowledge than when it merely requires 

a consideration of the words in the sentence. 

An example of the former type of sentence is, 

ﬁThe Dutch trains are white and very crowdedﬂ 

(they are"
Segment_20,"actually yellow), and an example of   the latter sentence type is, ﬁThe Dutch trains   are sour and very crowdedﬂ. Hagoort, Hald,   Bastiaansen, and Petersson (2004) used N400   as a measure of the time to detect a semantic   mismatch. There was no difference in N400   between the two conditions, s",Explores how awareness influences cognition.,"awareness, emotion, memory",Nested under Chapter on attention,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in perception,Aligned with contemporary studies on recognition,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_917," actually yellow), and an example of 

the latter sentence type is, ﬁThe Dutch trains 

are sour and very crowdedﬂ. Hagoort, Hald, 

Bastiaansen, and Petersson (2004) used N400 

as a measure of the time to detect a semantic 

mismatch. There was no difference in N400 

between the two conditions, suggesting there 

is no time delay in utilising world knowledge.
ERPs provide more detailed information 
about the time course of brain activity than most 

other techniques. For example, a behavioural 

measure such as reaction time typically provides 

only a 
single
 measure of time on each trial, 

whereas ERPs provide a 
continuous
 measure. 

However, ERPs do not indicate with any pre-

cision which brain regions are most involved 

in processing, in part because the presence of 

skull and brain tissue distorts the electrical 

˚
 elds created by the brain. In addition, ERPs

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
fMRI while participants learned a list of words. 
About 20 minutes later, the participants were 

given a test of recognition memory on which 

they failed to recognise 12% of the words. 

Did 
these recognition failures occur because 
of problems during 
learning
 or at 
retrieval
? 
Wagner answered this question by using event-

related fMRI, comparing brain activity during 

learning for words subsequently recognised 

with that for words not recognised. There was 

more brain activity in the prefrontal cortex 

and hippocampus for words subsequently 

remembered than for those not remembered. 

These ˚ ndings suggested that forgotten words 

were processed less thoroughly than remembered 

words at the time of learning.

more applicable to early stages of processing. 

Third, PET is an invasive technique because 

participants are injected with radioactively 

labelled water. This makes it unacceptable to 

some potential participants.
Magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI and fMRI)
In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), radio 
waves are used to excite atoms in the brain. 

This produces magnetic changes detected by 

a very large magnet (weighing up to 11 tons) 

surrounding the patient. These changes are 

then interpreted by a computer and turned into 

a very precise three-dimensional picture. MRI 

scans can be obtained from numerous different 

angles but only tell us about the 
structure
 of 

the brain rather than about its 
functions
.
Cognitive neuroscientists are generally more 
interested in brain functions than brain structure. 

Happily enough, MRI technology can provide 

functional information in the form of func-

tional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). 

Oxyhaemoglobin is converted into deoxyhae-

moglobin when neurons consume oxygen, and 

deoxyhaemoglobin produces distortions in the 

local magnetic ˚ eld. This distortion is assessed 

by fMRI, and provides a measure of the con-

centration of deoxyhaemoglobin in the blood. 

Technically, what is measured in fMRI is known 

as 
BOLD
 (blood oxygen-level-dependent con-
trast). Changes in the BOLD signal produced 

by increased neural activity take some time to 

occur, so the temporal resolution of fMRI is about 

2 or 3 seconds. However, its spatial resolution 

is very good (approximately 1 millimetre). Since 

the temporal and spatial resolution of fMRI 

are both much better than those of PET, fMRI 

has largely superseded PET.

Can cognitive neuroscientists read our brains/minds?
There is increasing evidence that cognitive neuro-

scientists can work out what we are looking at 

just by considering our brain activity. For example, 

Haxby, Gobbini, Furey, Ishai, Schouten, and Pietrini 

(2001) asked participants to look at pictures 

belonging to eight different categories (e.g., cats, 

faces, houses) while fMRI was used to assess 

patterns of brain activity.The experimenters accur-

ately predicted the category of object being 

looked at by participants on 96% of the trials!
Kay, Naselaris, Prenger, and Gallant (2008) 
argued that most previous research on Òbrain 

readingÓ was limited in two ways. First, the visual 

stimuli were much less complex than those we 

encounter in everyday life. Second, the experi-

mentersÕ task of predicting what people were 

looking at was simpliÞ ed by comparing their 

patterns of brain activity on test trials to those 

obtained when the same objects or categories 

had been presented previously. Kay et al. over-

came both limitations by presenting their two 

participants with 120 
novel
 natural images that 

were reasonably complex.The fMRI data permitted 

correct identiÞ
 cation of the image being viewed 
on 92% of the trials for one participant and on 

72% of trials for the other. This is remarkable 

accuracy given that chance performance would 

be 1/120 or 0.8%!
Why is research on Òbrain readingÓ impor-
tant? One reason is because it may prove very 

useful for identifying what people are dreaming 

about or imagining. More generally, it can reveal 

our true feelings about other people. Bartels and

administered in a fairly short period of time; 
this is 
repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation 

(rTMS)
.
What is an appropriate control condition 
against which to compare the effects of TMS? 

It might seem as if all that is needed is to 

compare performance on a task with and 

without TMS. However, TMS creates a loud 

noise and some twitching of the muscles at the 

side of the forehead, and these effects might 

lead to impaired performance. Applying TMS 

to a non-critical brain area (one theoretically 

not needed for task performance) is often a 

satisfactory control condition. The prediction 

is that task performance will be worse when 

TMS is applied to a critical area than to a 

non-critical one.
Why are TMS and rTMS useful? It has been 
argued that they create a ﬁtemporary lesionﬂ 

(a lesion is a structural alteration produced by 

brain damage), so that the role of any given 

brain area in performing a given task can be 

assessed. If TMS applied to a particular brain 

area leads to impaired task performance, it is 

reasonable to conclude that that brain area is 

necessary for task performance. Conversely, if 

TMS has no"
Segment_25,"effects on task performance, then   the brain area affected by it is not needed to   perform the task effectively. What is most   exciting about TMS is that it can be used to   show that activity in a particular brain area is   necessary  for normal levels of performance on   some task. Thus, we ar",Explores how recognition influences cognition.,"perception, attention, awareness",Nested under Chapter on recognition,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in attention,Aligned with contemporary studies on memory,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_901," effects on task performance, then 

the brain area affected by it is not needed to 

perform the task effectively. What is most 

exciting about TMS is that it can be used to 

show that activity in a particular brain area is 

necessary
 for normal levels of performance on 

some task. Thus, we are often in a stronger 
complex, because the size of the magnetic ˚
 eld 
created by the brain is extremely small relative 

to the earth™s magnetic ˚ eld. However, MEG 

provides very accurate measurement of brain 

activity, in part because the skull is virtually 

transparent to magnetic ˚ elds. That means that 

magnetic ˚ elds are little distorted by intervening 

tissue, which is an advantage over the electrical 

activity assessed by the EEG.
Overall, MEG has excellent temporal res-
olution (at the millisecond level) and often has 

very good spatial resolution as well. However, 

using MEG is extremely expensive, because 

SQUIDs need to be kept very cool by means 

of liquid helium, and recordings are taken 

under magnetically shielded conditions.
Anderson et al. (1996) used MEG to study 
the properties of an area of the visual cortex 

known as V5 or MT (see Chapter 2). This area 

was responsive to motion-contrast patterns, 

suggesting that its function is to detect objects 

moving relative to their background. Anderson 

et al. also found using MEG that V5 or MT 

was active about 20 ms after V1 (primary visual 

cortex) in response to motion-contrast patterns. 

These ˚ ndings suggested that some basic visual  

processing
 precedes
 motion detection.
People sometimes ˚ nd it uncomfortable to 
take part in MEG studies. Cooke et al. (2007) 

found that 35% of participants reported that 

the experience was ﬁa bit upsettingﬂ. The same 

percentage reported side effects (e.g., muscle 

aches, headaches).
Transcranial magnetic stimulation

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)
 is a 
technique in which a coil (often in the shape

cognitive neuropsychology. First, the experi-
menter controls the brain area(s) involved with 

TMS. 
Second, it is easy to compare any given 
individual™s performance with and without a 

lesion with TMS but this is rarely possible with  

brain-damaged patients. Third, brain damage 

may lead patients to develop compensatory 

strategies or to reorganise their cognitive system, 

whereas brief administration of TMS does not 

produce any such complications.
What are the limitations of TMS? First, it 
is not very clear exactly what TMS does to 

the brain. It mostly (but not always)
 reduces
 

activation in the brain areas affected. Allen, 

Pasley, Duong, and Freeman (2007) applied 

rTMS to the early visual cortex of cats not 

engaged in any task. rTMS caused an 
increase
 
of spontaneous brain activity that lasted up to 

1 minute. However, activity in the visual cortex 

produced by "
Segment_27,"viewing gratings was  reduced  by   up to 60% by rTMS, and took 10 minutes to   recover. Such differing patterns suggest that   the effects of TMS are complex. Second, TMS can only be applied to brain  areas lying beneath the skull but not to areas   with overlying muscle. That limits its overall",Explores how emotion influences cognition.,"awareness, recognition, emotion",Nested under Chapter on emotion,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in attention,Aligned with contemporary studies on memory,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_265,"viewing gratings was

up to 60% by rTMS, and took 10 minutes to 

recover. Such differing patterns suggest that 

the effects of TMS are complex.
Second, TMS can only be applied to brain 
areas lying beneath the skull but not to areas 

with overlying muscle. That limits its overall 

usefulness.
Third, it has proved dif˚ cult to establish 
the precise brain area or areas affected when 

TMS is used. It is generally assumed that its 

main effects are con˚ ned to a relatively small 

area. However, fMRI evidence suggests that TMS 

pulses can cause activity changes in brain areas 

distant from the area of stimulation (Bohning 

et al., 1999). Using fMRI in combination with 

TMS can often be an advantage Œ it sheds light 

on the connections between the brain area 

stimulated by TMS and other brain areas.
Fourth, there are safety issues with TMS. 
For example, it has very occasionally caused 

seizures in participants in spite of stringent 

rules to try to ensure the safety of participants 

in TMS studies.
Fifth, it may be hard to show that TMS 
applied to any brain area has adverse effects on  

simple tasks. As Robertson, Théoret, and Pascual-

Leone (2003, p. 955) 
pointed out, ﬁWith the 
inherent redundancy of the brain and its r e
sulting 
position to make causal statements about the 

brain areas underlying performance when we 

use TMS than most other techniques.
We can see the advantages of using TMS 
by considering research discussed more fully in  

Chapter 5. In a study by Johnson and Zatorre 

(2006), participants performed visual and 

auditory tasks separately or together (dual-task 

condition). The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex 

was only activated in the dual-task condition, 

suggesting that this condition required processes 

relating to task co-ordination. However, it was 

not clear that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex 

was actually 
necessary
 for successful dual-task 

performance. Accordingly, Johnson, Strafella, 

and "
Segment_28,"Zatorre (2007) used the same tasks as   Johnson and Zatorre (2006) while administering   rTMS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.   This caused impaired performance in the dual-  task condition, thus strengthening the argument   that involvement of the dorsolateral prefrontal   cortex is essentia",Explores how emotion influences cognition.,"attention, recognition, emotion",Nested under Chapter on awareness,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in recognition,Aligned with contemporary studies on memory,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_456,"Zatorre (2007) used the same tasks as 

Johnson and Zatorre (2006) while administering 

rTMS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. 

This caused impaired performance in the dual-

task condition, thus strengthening the argument 

that involvement of the dorsolateral prefrontal 

cortex is essential in that condition.
TMS can also provide insights into 
when
 
any given brain area is most involved in task 

performance. For example, Cracco, Cracco, 

Maccabee, and Amassian (1999) gave participants 

the task of detecting letters. Performance was 

maximally impaired when TMS was applied to 

occipital cortex 80 Œ100 ms after the presentation 

of the letters rather than at shorter or longer 

delays.
Evaluation
As indicated already, the greatest advantage of 

TMS (and rTMS) over neuroimaging techniques
 
is that it increases our con˚
 
dence that a given 
brain area is necessary for the performance 

of some task. TMS allows us to 
manipulate
 

or experimentally control the availability of 

any part of the brain for involvement in the 

performance of some cognitive task. In contrast, 

we can only establish associations or correla-

tions between activation in various brain areas 

and task performance when using functional 

neuroimaging.
TMS can be regarded as producing a brief 
ﬁlesionﬂ, but it has various advantages over 

research on brain-damaged patients within

task. Alternatively, some brain activation might 
occur because participants have worries about 

task performance or because they engage in 

unnecessary monitoring of their performance.
Transcranial magnetic stimulation offers a 
partial solution to the causality issue. We can 

show that a given brain area is necessary for 

the performance of a task by ˚ nding that TMS 

disrupts that performance. Accordingly, TMS 

is a technique of special "
Segment_29,"importance. Third, most functional neuroimaging research  is based on the assumption of  functional spe-  cialisation , namely, that each brain region is   specialised for a different function.

is based on the assumption of

, namely, that each brain region is 

specialised for a different function. This notion 

became very popular 200 years ago with the 

advent of
 phrenology
 (the notion that individual 

differences in various mental faculties are revealed 

by bumps in the skull). Phrenology (advocated 

by Gall and Spurzheim) is essentially useless, 

but there is a grain of truth in the idea that 

fMRI is ﬁphrenology with magnetsﬂ (Steve 

Hammett, personal communication).
The assumption of functional specialisation 
has some justi˚ cation when we focus on relatively 

basic or low-level processes. For example, one 

part of the brain specialises in colour processing  

and another area in motion processing (see 

Chapter 2). However, higher-order cognitive 

functions are not organised neatly and tidily. For 

example, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is 

activated during the performance of an enormous 

range of complex tasks requiring the use of 

executive functions (see Chapter 5).
Cognitive neuroscientists have increasingly 
accepted that there is substantial 
integration
 

and co-ordination across the brain and that 
high capacity to compensate for disruption 

caused by TMS, it is perhaps only through 

straining the available neuronal resources with 

a reasonably complex 
task that it becomes 

possible to observe 
behavioural impairment.ﬂ
Overall evaluation
Do the various techniques for studying the 

brain provide the answers to all our prayers? 

Many in˜ uential authorities are unconvinced. 

For example, Fodor (1999) argued as follows: 

ﬁIf the mind happens in space at all, it happens 

somewhere north of the neck. What exactly 

turns on knowing how far north?ﬂ We do not 

agree with that scepticism. Cognitive neuroscientists 

using various brain techniques have contributed 

enormously to our understanding of human 

cognition. We have men"

here, but numerous other examples are discussed 

throughout the book. The overall impact of 

cognitive neuroscience on our understanding 

of human cognition is increasing very rapidly.
We will now turn to six issues raised by 
cognitive neuroscience. First, none of the brain 

techniques provides magical insights into human 

cognition. We must avoid succumbing to ﬁthe 

neuroimaging illusionﬂ. This is the mistaken 

view that patterns of brain activation provide 

direct
 evidence concerning cognitive processing. 

Weisberg, Keil, Goodstein, Rawson, and Gray 

(2008; see Chapter 14) found that psychology 

students were unduly impressed by explanations  

of ˚ ndings when there was neuroimaging evidence. 

In fact, patterns of brain activation are dependent 

variables. They are sources of information about 

human cogni tion but need to be interpreted 

within the context of other relevant information.
Second, most brain-imaging techniques 
reveal only 
associations
 between patterns of 

brain activation and behaviour (e.g., performance  

on a reasoning task is associated with activation 

of the prefrontal cortex). Such associations are 

basically correlational, and do 
not
 demonstrate 
that the brain regions activated are essential 

for task performance. A given brain region 

may be activated because participants have 

chosen to use a particular strategy that is not 

the only one that could be used to perform the 
functional specialisation:
 the assumption 
that each brain area or region is specialised for 

a speciÞ c function (e.g., colour processing; 

face processing).

faculty is located in a different part of the brain

are revealed by bumps in the skull.This 

phrenology chart, from the 
People™s Cyclopedia 

of Universal Knowledge
 (1883), demarcates 

these areas.
that imaging data represents is often one about 
which cognitive theories make no necessary 

predictions. It is, therefore, inappropriate to 

use such data to choose between such theories.ﬂ 

However, that argument has lost some of its force 

in recent years. We have increased knowledge 

of where in the brain many psychological 

processes occur, and that makes it feasible to 

use psychological theories to predict patterns 

of brain activation.
Functional neuroimaging ˚
 ndings are 
often of direct relevance to resolving theoretical 

controversies within cognitive psychology. Here, 

we will brie˜ y discuss two examples. Our ˚
 rst 
example concerns the controversy about the 

nature of visual imagery (see Chapter 3). Kosslyn 

(1994) argued that visual imagery uses the 

same processes as visual perception, whereas 

Pylyshyn (2000) claimed that visual imagery 

involves making use of propositional knowledge  

about what things would look like in the 

imagined situation. Most behavioural evidence 

is inconclusive. However, Kosslyn and Thompson 

(2003) found in a meta-analysis of functional 

neuroimaging studies that visual imagery is 

generally associated with activation in the 

primary visual cortex or BA17 (activated during 

the early stages of visual perception). These 

˚
 ndings strongly suggest that similar processes 
are used in imagery and perception.
Our second example concerns the processing 
of unattended stimuli (see Chapter 5). Historically, 

some theorists (e.g., Deutsch & Deutsch, 1963) 

argued that even unattended stimuli receive 

thorough processing. Studies using event-related 

potentials (ERPs; see Glossary) showed that 

unattended stimuli (visual and auditory) were 

less thoroughly processed "
Segment_32,"than attended stimuli   even shortly after stimulus presentation (see Luck,   1998, for a review). For example, in an ERP   study by Martinez et al. (1999), attended visual   displays produced a greater ˚ rst positive wave   about 70 Œ75 ms after stimulus presentation and   a greater ˚ rst negative",Explores how memory influences cognition.,"emotion, perception, recognition",Nested under Chapter on awareness,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in memory,Aligned with contemporary studies on emotion,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_861,"than attended stimuli 

even shortly after stimulus presentation (see Luck, 

1998, for a review). For example, in an ERP 

study by Martinez et al. (1999), attended visual 

displays produced a greater ˚ rst positive wave 

about 70 Œ75 ms after stimulus presentation and 

a greater ˚ rst negative wave at 130 Œ140 ms.
Fifth, when researchers argue that a given 
brain region is active during the performance 

of a task, they mean it is active relative to some 

baseline. What is an appropriate baseline? We 
functional specialisation is 
not
 always found. 

Such functional integration can be studied 

by 
correlating
 activity across different brain 
regions Œ if a network of brain areas is involved 

in a particular process, then activity in all of 

them should be positively correlated when 

that process occurs. Let us consider the brain 

areas associated with conscious perception 

(see 
Chapter 16). Melloni, Molina, Pena, Torres, 
Singer, and Rodriguez (2007) assessed EEG 

activity at several brain sites for words that were 

or were not consciously perceived. Conscious 

perception was associated with synchronised 

activity across large areas of the brain.
Fourth, there is the issue of whether functional 
neuroimaging research is 
relevant
 to testing 

cognitive theories. According to Page (2006, 

p. 428), ﬁThe additional dependent variable

These patients have suffered 
lesions
 Œ structural 

alterations within the brain caused by injury or  

disease. According to cognitive neuropsychologists, 

the study of brain-damaged patients can tell 

us much about normal human cognition. We 

can go further. As McCloskey (2001, p. 594) 

pointed out, ﬁComplex systems often reveal 

their inner workings more clearly when they 

are malfunctioning than when they are running 

smoothly.ﬂ He described how he only began 

to discover much about his laser printer when 

it started misprinting things.
We can gain insight into the cognitive neuro-
psychological approach by 
considering a 
brain-
damaged patient (AC) studied by 
Coltheart, 

Inglis, Cupples, Michie, Bates, and Budd (1998). 

AC was a 67-year-old man who had suffered 

several strokes, leading to severe problems with 

object knowledge. If we possess a
 single
 system 
for object knowledge, then AC should be severely 

impaired for 
all
 aspects of object recognition. 

That is not what Coltheart et al. found. AC 

seemed to possess practically no visual information  
might argue that the resting state (e.g., participant 

rests with his / her eyes shut) is a suitable baseline 

condition. This might make sense if the brain 

were relatively inactive in the resting state and 

only showed much activity when dealing with 

immediate environmental demands. In fact, 

the increased brain activity occurring when 

participants perform a task typically adds only 

a modest amount (5% or less) to resting brain 

activity. 
Why
 is the brain so active even when 
the environment is unstimulating? Patterns of 

brain activity are similar in different states of 

consciousness including coma, anaesthesia, and  

slow-wave sleep (Boly et al., 2008), suggesting 

that most intrinsic brain activity re˜
 ects basic 
brain functioning.
It is typically assumed in functional 
neuroimaging research tha"
Segment_34,"t task performance   produces  increased  brain activity re˜  ecting task  demands. In fact, there is often  decreased  brain   activity in certain brain regions across several   tasks and relative to various baseline conditions   (see Raichle & Snyder, 2007, for a review).   As Raichle and Synder (",Explores how emotion influences cognition.,"memory, perception, recognition",Nested under Chapter on perception,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in memory,Aligned with contemporary studies on perception,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_454,"t task performance 

produces 
increased
 brain activity re˜
 ecting task 
demands. In fact, there is often 
decreased
 brain 

activity in certain brain regions across several 

tasks and relative to various baseline conditions 

(see Raichle & Snyder, 2007, for a review). 

As Raichle and Synder (p. 1085) concluded, 

ﬁRegardless of the task under investigation, 

the activity decreases almost always included 

the posterior cingulate and adjacent precuneus, 

a region we nicknamed MMPA for ‚medial 

mystery parietal area™.ﬂ Thus, brain functioning 

is much more complex than often assumed.
Sixth, we pointed out earlier that much 
research in cognitive psychology suffers from 

a relative lack of ecological validity (applicability 

to everyday life) and paradigm specificity 

(˚
 ndings do not generalise from one paradigm 
to others). The same limitations apply to cognitive 

neuroscience since cognitive neuroscientists 

generally use tasks previously developed by 

cognitive psychologists. Indeed, the problem 

of ecological validity may be greater in cognitive 

neuroscience. Participants in studies using 

fMRI (the most used technique) lie on their 

backs in somewhat claustrophobic and noisy 

conditions and have only restricted movement 

Œ conditions differing markedly from those of 

everyday life!
Gutchess and Park (2006) investigated 
whether participants performing a task in the

encoding and recognising perceptual inputs. 
As we will see in Chapter 2, the processing of 

various aspects of visual stimuli (e.g., colour, 

form, motion) occurs in speci˚ c brain areas 

and seems to be domain-speci˚
 c.
Fodor (1983) also argued that the central 
system (involved in higher-level processes such 

as thinking and reasoning) is 
"
Segment_35,"not  modular. For   example, attentional processes appear to be   domain-independent in that we can attend   to an extremely wide range of external and   internal stimuli. However, some evolutionary   psychologists have argued that most information-  processing systems are modular Œ the ﬁmassive   m",Explores how emotion influences cognition.,"perception, emotion, recognition",Nested under Chapter on perception,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in recognition,Aligned with contemporary studies on perception,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_689,"not

example, attentional processes appear to be 

domain-independent in that we can attend 

to an extremely wide range of external and 

internal stimuli. However, some evolutionary 

psychologists have argued that most information-

processing systems are modular Œ the ﬁmassive 

modularity hypothesisﬂ (see Barrett & Kurzban, 

2006, for a review). The argument is that, 

complex processing will be more ef˚
 cient if 
we possess numerous speci˚ c modules than if 

we possess fewer general processing functions. 

The debate continues. However, we probably 

have some general, domain-independent 
pro-

cessors to co-ordinate and integrate the outputs 

of the speci˚
 c modules or processors (see 
Chapter 16).
The second major assumption of cognitive 
neuropsychology is that of 
anatomical modular-

ity
. According to this assumption, each module 

is located in a speci˚ c and potentially identi˚
 -
able area of the brain. Why is this assumption 

important? In essence, cognitive neuropsychol-

ogists are likely to make most progress when 

studying patients having brain damage limited 

to a single module. Such patients may not exist 

if the assumption of anatomical modularity is 

incorrect. For example, suppose all modules 

were distributed across large areas of the brain. 
about objects (e.g., the colours of animals; 

whether certain species possess legs). However, 

AC was right 95% of the time when classifying 

animals as dangerous or not and had a 90% 

success rate when deciding which animals are 

normally eaten. He was also right over 90% 

of the time when asked questions about auditory 

perceptual knowledge of animals (ﬁDoes it make 

a sound?ﬂ).
What can we conclude from the study of 
AC? First, there is probably no 
single
 object 

knowledge system. Second, our stored knowledge 

of the visual properties of objects is probably 

stored separately from our stored knowledge 

of other properties (e.g., auditory, olfactory).

ments to his/her regions of brain damage. 

That was 
typically

 the case until fairly 
recently. 
However, cognitive neuropsychologists 
increasingly take account of the brain, using 

techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging 

(MRI; see Glossary) to identify the brain areas 

damaged in any given patient.
Theoretical assumptions
Coltheart (2001) described very clearly the 

main theoretical assumptions of cognitive 

neuropsychology, and his analysis will form 

the basis of our account. One key assumption 

is that of 
modularity
, meaning that the cogni-

tive system consists of numerous modules or 

processors operating relatively independently 

of or separately from each other. It is assumed 

that these modules exhibit 
domain speciÞ
 city
, 
meaning they respond only to one particular 

class of stimuli. For example, there may be 

a face-recognition module that responds only 

when a face is presented.
The modularity assumption may or may not 
be correct. Fodor (1983) argued that humans 

possess various input modules involved in 
modularity:
 the assumption that the cognitive 
system consists of several fairly independent 

processors or modules.

domain speciÞ
 city:
 the notion that a given 
module or cognitive process responds selectively 

to certain types of stimuli (e.g., faces) but not 

others.

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
Research in cognitive 
neuropsychology
How do cognitive neuropsychologists set about 
understanding the cognitive system? Of major 

importance is the search for a 
dissoc"
Segment_37,"iation ,   which occurs when a patient performs normally   on one task (task X) but is impaired on a   second task (task Y). For example, the great   majority of amnesic patients perform almost   normally on short-term memory tasks but are   greatly impaired on many long-term memory   tasks (see Cha",Explores how emotion influences cognition.,"attention, perception, emotion",Nested under Chapter on perception,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in memory,Aligned with contemporary studies on emotion,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_1033,"iation
, 

which occurs when a patient performs normally 

on one task (task X) but is impaired on a 

second task (task Y). For example, the great 

majority of amnesic patients perform almost 

normally on short-term memory tasks but are 

greatly impaired on many long-term memory 

tasks (see Chapter 6). It is tempting (but potenti-

ally dangerous!) to use such ˚ ndings to argue 

that the two tasks involve different processing 

modules and that the module or modules 

needed on long-term memory tasks have been 

damaged by brain injury.
We need to avoid drawing sweeping 
conclusions from dissociations. A patient may 

perform well on one task but poorly on a 

second task simply because the second task is 

more complex than the ˚ rst rather than because  

the second requires speci˚ c modules affected 

by brain damage.
The agreed solution to the above problem 
is to look for double dissociations. A 
double 

dissociation
 between two tasks (X and Y) is 

shown when one patient performs normally 

on task X and at an impaired level on task Y, 

whereas another patient performs normally on 

task Y and at an impaired level on task X. If 

a double dissociation can be shown, we cannot 

explain the ˚
 ndings away as occurring because 
one task is harder. Here is a concrete example 
If so, the great majority of brain-damaged 

patients would suffer damage to most modules, 

and it would be impossible to work out the 

number and nature of modules they possessed. 

There is some evidence for anatomical modularity 

in the visual processing system (see Chapter 2). 

However, there is less support for anatomical 

modularity with many complex tasks. For ex-

ample, Duncan and Owen (2000) found that 

the same areas within the frontal lobes were 

activated when very different complex tasks 

were being performed.
The third major assumption is what 
Coltheart (2001, p. 10) called ﬁuniformity of 

functional architecture across peopleﬂ. Suppose  

this assumption is "
Segment_38,"actually false, and there are   substantial individual differences in the arrange-  ment of modules. We would not be able to use   the ˚ ndings from individual patients to draw   conclusions about other people™s functional   architecture. We must certainly hope the assump-  tion of  uniformity of fu",Explores how attention influences cognition.,"attention, awareness, emotion",Nested under Chapter on emotion,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in emotion,Aligned with contemporary studies on recognition,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_619,"actually false, and there are

ment of modules. We would not be able to use 

the ˚ ndings from individual patients to draw 

conclusions about other people™s functional 

architecture. We must certainly hope the assump-

tion of 
uniformity of functional architecture is 
correct. Why is that? According to Coltheart 

(2001, p. 10), ﬁThis assumption is not peculiar 

to cognitive neuropsychology; it is widespread 

throughout the whole of cognitive psychology. 

Thus, if this assumption is false, that™s not just 

bad news for cognitive neuropsychology; it is 

bad news for all of cognitive psychology.ﬂ
The fourth assumption is that of 
subtractiv-
ity
: ﬁBrain damage can impair or delete existing 

boxes or arrows in the system, but cannot 

introduce new ones: that is, it can subtract from 

the system, but cannot add to itﬂ (Coltheart, 

2001, p. 10). (In case you are wondering, 

ﬁboxesﬂ refers to modules and ﬁarrowsﬂ to 

the connections between modules.) 
Why
 is the 

subtractivity assumption important? Suppose 

it is incorrect and patients develop new modules 

to compensate for the cognitive impairments 

caused by brain damage. That would make it 

very hard to learn much about intact cognitive 

systems by studying brain-damaged patients. 

The subtractivity assumption is more likely to 

be correct when brain damage occurs in adult-

hood (rather than childhood) and when cognitive 

performance is assessed shortly after the onset 

of brain damage.

 as applied to brain-damaged 
patients, normal performance on one task 

combined with severely impaired performance 

on another task.

double dissociation:
 the Þ nding that some 

individuals (often brain-damaged) do well on 

task A and poorly on task B, whereas others 

show the opposite pattern.

Groups vs. individuals
Should cognitive neuropsychologists carry out 
group studies (in which patients with the same 

symptoms or syndromes are considered together) 

or single-case studies? In most psychological 

research, we have more con˚ dence in ˚
 ndings 
based on fairly large groups of participants. 

However, the group - based approach is problematic 

when applied to cognitive neuropsychological 

research because patients typically vary in their 

patterns of impairment. Indeed, every patient 

can be regarded as unique just as snow˜
 akes 
are different from each other (Caramazza & 

Coltheart, 2006). The key problems with group 

studies are that, ﬁ(a) aggregating (combining ) data 

over patients requires the assumption that the 

patients are homogenous (uniform) with respect 

to the nature of their de˚ cits, but (b) that regardless 

of how patients are selected, homogeneity of 

de˚
 cits cannot be assumed a priori (and indeed 
is unlikely when de˚ cits are characterised at the 

level of detail required for addressing issues of 

current interest in the study of normal cognition)ﬂ 

(McCloskey, 2001, pp. 597Œ598).
However, it is useful to conduct group studies 
in the early stages of research; they can provide 

a broad-brush picture, and can be followed by 

single-case studies to ˚ ll in the details. However, 

the single-case approach also has problems. As 

Shallice (1991, p. 433) argued, ﬁA selective 

impairment found in a particular task in some 

patient could just re˜ ect: the patient™s idiosyn-

cratic strategy, the greater dif˚ culty of that task 

compared with the others, a premorbid lacuna 

( gap) in that patient, or the way a reorganised 

system but not the original system operates.ﬂ 

These problems can be overcome to some extent 

by replicating the ˚ ndings from a single case 
of a double dissociation. Amnesic patients have 

severely impaired performance on many tasks 

involving long-term memory but essentially 

i"
Segment_40,ntact performance on tasks involving short-  term memory (see Chapter 6). There are also   other patients whose short-term memory is   more impaired than their long-term memory   (see Chapter 6). This double dissociation suggests   that different modules underlie short-term and   long-term memory. T,Explores how recognition influences cognition.,"attention, awareness, memory",Nested under Chapter on memory,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in memory,Aligned with contemporary studies on recognition,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_549,"ntact performance on tasks involving short-

other patients whose short-term memory is 

more impaired than their long-term memory 

(see Chapter 6). This double dissociation suggests 

that different modules underlie short-term and 

long-term memory.
The existence of double dissociations provides 
reasonable evidence that two systems are at 

work, one required for task X and the other 

needed for task Y. However, there are limitations 

with the use of double dissociations. First, as 

Dunn and Kirsner (2003) pointed out, here is 

the ideal scenario: module A is required only 

on task X and module B only on task Y, and 

there are patients having damage only to 

module A and others having damage only to 

module B. In fact, of course, reality is typically 

far messier than that, making it hard to interpret  

most ˚ ndings. Second, the literature contains 

hundreds of double dissociations, only some 

having genuine theoretical relevance. It is not 

easy to decide 
which
 double dissociations 

are important. Third, double dissociations can 

provide evidence of the existence of 
two
 separ-
ate systems but are of little use when trying to 

show the existence of three or four systems.
For the sake of completeness, we will brie˜
 y 
consider associations. An 
association
 occurs 

when a patient is impaired on task X and is 

also impaired on task Y. Historically, there was 

much emphasis on associations of symptoms. 

It was regarded as of central importance to 

identify 
syndromes
, certain sets of symptoms 
or impairments usually found together. A 

syndrome-based approach allows us to assign 

brain-damaged patients to a fairly small number 

of categories. However, there is a fatal ˜
 aw 
with the syndrome-based approach: associations 

can occur even if tasks X and Y depend on 

entirely separate processing mechanisms or 

modules if these mechanisms are adjacent 

in the brain. Thus, associations often"

extensive than that. When several processing 
modules are damaged, it is often dif˚
 cult to 
make sense of the ˚
 ndings.
Fourth, there are often large differences 
among individuals having broadly similar brain 

damage in terms of age, expertise, and educa-

tion. These differences may have important 

consequences. For example, extensive practice 

can produce large changes in the brain areas 

activated during the performance of a task (see 

Chapter 5). The implication is that the effects 

of any given brain damage on task performance 

would probably vary depending on how much 

previous practice patients had had on the task 

in question.
Fifth, cognitive neuropsychology has often 
been applied to relatively 
speciÞ c 
aspects of 
cognitive functioning. Take research on language. 

There has been a substantial amount of work 

on the reading and spelling of individual words 

by brain-damaged patients, but much less on 

text comprehension (Harley, 2004). However, 

cognitive neuropsychologists have recently studied 

more general aspects of cognition such as think-

ing and reasoning (see Chapter 14).
COMPUTATIONAL 
COGNITIVE SCIENCE
We will start by drawing a distinction between 
computational modelling and arti˚
 cial intelligence. 
Computational modelling 
involves programming 
computers to model or mimic some aspects 

of human cognitive functioning. In contrast, 
or patient by studying further single cases (the 

multiple single-patient study method).
Here is another"
Segment_42,"argument in favour of single- case studies. When cognitive neuropsychologists   carry out a case study, they are generally interested   in testing some theory. The theory being tested   is like a large and complicated jigsaw puzzle,   and the individual patients are like very small   jigsaw pieces.",Explores how perception influences cognition.,"perception, attention, memory",Nested under Chapter on awareness,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in recognition,Aligned with contemporary studies on emotion,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_905," argument in favour of single-
case studies. When cognitive neuropsychologists 

carry out a case study, they are generally interested 

in testing some theory. The theory being tested 

is like a large and complicated jigsaw puzzle, 

and the individual patients are like very small 

jigsaw pieces. If the theory is correct, patients 

with very different symptoms will nevertheless 

˚
 t into the jigsaw puzzle. Conversely, if the 
theory is incorrect, some patients (jigsaw pieces) 

will not ˚ t the theory (jigsaw puzzle). However, 

most of the pieces are very small, and it may 

be a long time before we see a coherent picture. 

Thus, it is advantageous that patients differ 

from each other Œ it means the underlying 

theory is exposed to many different tests.
Limitations
What are the limitations of the cognitive 

n europsychological approach? First, it is generally 

assumed that the cognitive performance of brain-

damaged patients provides fairly direct evidence  

of the impact of brain damage on previously 

normal cognitive systems. However, some of the 

impact of brain damage on cognitive performance 

may be camou˜ aged because patients develop 

compensatory strategies
 to help them cope with 
their brain damage. For example, consider 

patients with pure alexia, a condition in which 

there are severe reading problems. Such patients 

manage to read words by using the compensatory 

strategy of identifying each letter separately.
Second, much research on cognitive neuro-
psychology i s  
based on the seriality assumption  

(Harley, 2004), according to which processing 

is serial and proceeds from one module to 

another. However, the brain consists of about 

50 billion 
interconnected
 neurons and several 

different brain regions are activated in an 

integrated way during the performance of tasks 

(see Chapter 16). Thus, the seriality assumption 

appears to be incorrect.
Third, cognitive neuropsychology would 
be fairly straightforward if most"
Segment_43,"patients had   suffered damage to only  one  module. In practice,    however, brain damage is typically much more  computational cognitive science:   an approach that involves constructing   computational models to understand human   cognition.

plausible or meaningful, whereas everything 
below it is not. We need to do this because 

parts of any program are there simply because 

of the particular programming language being 

used and the machine on which the program 

is running. For example, to see what the 

program is doing, we need to have print 

commands in the program showing the outputs 

of various stages on the computer™s screen.
Other issues arise about the relationship 
between the performance of the program and 

human performance (Costello & Keane, 2000).  

It is rarely meaningful to relate the speed of the  

program doing a simulated task to the reaction 

time taken by human participants, because the 

processing times of programs are affected by 

psychologically irrelevant features. For example, 

programs run faster on more powerful computers. 

However, the various materials presented to the 

program should result in differences in program 

operation time 
correlating closely with differences 

in participants™ 
reaction times in processing the 
same materials. At the very least, the program 

should reproduce the same outputs as participants 

given the same inputs.

 involves constructing 
computer systems that produce intelligent

little resemblance to those used by humans. For 

example, consider the chess program known 

as Deep Blue, which won a famous match against 

the then World Champion Garry Kasparov on 

11 May 1997. Deep Blue considered up to 200 

million positions per second, which is radically 

different from the very small number focused 

on by human chess players (see Chapter 12).
Computational cognitive scientists develop 
computational models to understand human 

cognition. A good computational model shows 

us how a given theory can be speci˚
 ed and 
allows us to predict behaviour in new situ-

ations. Mathematical models were used in 

experimental psychology long before the emer-

gence of the information-processing paradigm 

(e.g., in IQ testing). These models can be used 

to make predictions, but often lack an explana-

tory component. For example, having three 

traf˚
 c violations is a good predictor of whether 
a person is a bad risk for car insurance, but

computational models developed in computa-

an explanatory and predictive basis for a phe-

nomenon (e.g., Costello & Keane, 2000).
In the past, many experimental cognitive 
psychologists stated their theories in vague 

verbal statements, making it hard to decide 

whether the evidence fitted the theory. In

but an everyday example is, ﬁIf the green man 
is lit up, then cross the road.ﬂ In a typical 

production system model, there is a long-term 

memory containing numerous IF . . . THEN 

rules. There is also a working memory (i.e., a 

system holding information that is currently 

being processed). If information from the 

environment that ﬁgreen man is lit upﬂ reaches 

working memory, it will match the IF-part of 

the rule in long-term memory and trigger the 

THEN-part of the rule (i.e., cross the road).
Production systems have the following 
characteristics:

IF a list in working memory has a B at

If we input A, it will go into working memory
. 
This A matches rule 1, and so when the THEN-
part is executed, working memory will contain 

an AB. On the next cycle, AB doesn™t match 

rule 1 but does match rule 2. As a result, the B  

is replaced by an A, leaving an AA in working 

memory. The system will next produce AAB, 

then AAAB, and so on.
Many aspects of cognition can be speci˚
 ed 
as sets of IF . . . THEN rules. For example, chess 
knowledge can readily be represented as a set 

of productions based on rules such as, ﬁIf the 

Queen is threatened, then move the Queen to 

a safe square.ﬂ In this way, people™s basic 

knowledge can be regarded as a collection of 

productions.
Newell and Simon (1972) ˚
 rst established 
the usefulness of production system models in 

characterising the cognitive processes involved 

in problem solving (see Chapter 12). However, 

these models have a wider applicability. For 

example, Anderson (1993) put forward his 

ACT-R theory (Adaptive Control of Thought 

Œ Rational), which can account for a wide 

range of findings. He distinguished among 

frameworks, theories, and models. Frameworks  

make very general claims about cognition, 

theories specify in some detail how frameworks 

operate, and models are speci˚
 c kinds of 
theories that are applied to speci˚ c tasks and 

behaviour.
ACT-R
ACT-R has been systematically expanded and 

improved in the years since 1993. For example, 

Anderson et al. (2004) put forward the most 

comprehensive version of ACT-R (discussed 

more fully in Chapter 12), one that quali˚
 es 
as a cognitive architecture. What are cognitive 

architectures? According to Su"

architectures focus on those aspects of the 

cognitive system that remain fairly invariant

The version of ACT-R described by Anderson 
et al. (2004) is based on the assumption that 

the cognitive system consists of several modules 

(relatively independent subsystems). These include 

the following: (1) a visual-object module that 

keeps track of what objects are being viewed; 

(2) a visual-location module that monitors 

where objects are; (3) a manual module that 

controls the hands; (4) a goal module that keeps 

track of current goals; and (5) a declarative 

module that retrieves relevant information.

variously called. 
Connectionist networks
 make 

use of elementary units or nodes connected 

together, and consist of various structures 

or layers (e.g., input; intermediate or hidden; 

output). Connectionist networks often (but 

not always) have the following characteristics 

(see Figure 1.6):
The network consists of elementary or 
¥ 
neuron-like 
units
 or 
nodes 
connected 
together so that a single unit has many links
 
to other units.

Units affect other units by exciting or 
¥ 
inhibiting them.

The unit usually takes the weighted sum of 
¥ 
all of the input links, and produces a single 

output to another unit if the weighted sum 

exceeds some threshold value.

The network as a whole is characterised by 
¥ 
the properties of the units that make it up, 

by the way they are connected together, and
 
by the rules used to change the strength of 

connections among units.

weights on the links between units in the net. 
In Figure 1.7, the weight on the links to a unit, 

as well as the activation of other units, plays 

a crucial role in computing the response of that  

unit. Various learning rules modify these weights 

systematically until the net produces the required 

output patterns given certain input patterns.
One such learning rule is ﬁbackward pro-
pagation of errorsﬂ or BackProp. 
Back-propagation
 
is a mechanism allowing a network to learn 

to associate a particular input pattern with 

a given output pattern by comparing actual 

responses against correct ones. The network is 

initially set up with random weights on the 

links among the units. During the early stages 

of learning, the output units often produce an 

incorrect pattern or response after the input 
weighted sum of all these inputs. If this sum 

exceeds some threshold, it produces an output. 

Figure 1.7 shows a simple diagram of just such 

a unit, which takes the inputs from various 

other units and sums them to produce an 

output if a certain threshold is exceeded.
These networks can model cognitive per-
formance without the explicit rules found in 

production systems. They do this by storing 

patterns of activation in the network that 

associate various inputs with certain outputs. 

The models typically make use of several layers 

to deal with complex behaviour. One layer 

consists of input units that encode a stimulus 

as a pattern of activation in those units. Another  

layer is an output "

(2001; see Chapter 9); the TRACE model of word 

recognition (McClelland & Elman, 1986; see 

Chapter 9); and the models of speech production 

put forward by Dell (1986) and by Levelt, 

Roelofs, and Meyer (1999a; see Chapter 11). 

It is likely that some knowledge is represented 

locally and some is distributed (see Chapter 7).
Production systems vs. 
connectionism
Anderson and Lebiere (2003) evaluated connec-
tionism and production systems (exempli˚
 ed by 
ACT-R) with respect to 12 criteria (see Table 1.1). 

These ratings are within-theory: they only 

indicate how well a theory has done on a given 

criterion relative to its performance on other 

criteria. Thus, the ratings do 
not
 provide a direct 

comparison of the two th"
Segment_51,eoretical approaches.   It is nevertheless interesting to consider those   criteria for which the ratings differ considerably   between the two theories: operates in human   time; uses language; accounts for developmen-  tal phenomena; and theoretical components   map onto the brain. We will start w,Explores how recognition influences cognition.,"emotion, perception, attention",Nested under Chapter on emotion,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in awareness,Aligned with contemporary studies on recognition,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_618,"eoretical approaches. 

It is nevertheless interesting to consider those 

criteria for which the ratings differ considerably 

between the two theories: operates in human 

time; uses language; accounts for developmen-

tal phenomena; and theoretical components 

map onto the brain.
We will start with operating in human time. 
Within ACT-R, every processing step has a time 

associated with it. In contrast, most connectionist  

models don™t account for the timing effects 

produced by perceptual or motor aspects of a 

task. In addition, the number of trials to acquire 

an ability is generally much greater in connectionist 

models than in human learning.
So far as the criterion of using language is 
concerned, several major connectionist theories 

are in the area of language. In contrast, Anderson 

and Lebiere (2003, p. 599) admitted that, 

ﬁACT-R™s treatment of natural language is 

fragmentary.ﬂ Connectionist models have had 

some success in accounting for developmental 

phenomena by assuming that development is 

basically a learning process constrained by 

brain architecture and the timing of brain 

development. ACT-R has little to say about 

developmental phenomena.
Finally, there is the criterion of the mapping 
between theoretical components and the brain. 
pattern has been presented. BackProp compares 

the imperfect pattern with the known required 

response, noting the errors that occur. It then 

b ack-propagates activation through the network 

so the weights between the units are adjusted to  

produce the required pattern. This process is 

repeated with a given stimulus pattern until the 

network produces the required response pattern.  

Thus, the model learns the desired behaviour 

without being explicitly programmed to do so.
Networks have been used to produce 
interesting 
results. In a classic study, Sejnowski 
and Rosenberg (1987) gave a connectionist 

network called NETtalk 50,000 trials to learn 

the spellingŒsound relationship"
Segment_52,"s of a set of   1000 words. NETtalk achieved 95% success   with the words on which it had been trained.   It was also 77% correct on a further 20,000   words. Thus, the network seemed to have   learned the ﬁrules of English pronunciationﬂ   without having explicit rules for combining   and encoding",Explores how recognition influences cognition.,"awareness, emotion, perception",Nested under Chapter on memory,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in awareness,Aligned with contemporary studies on recognition,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_11,"s of a set of 

1000 words. NETtalk achieved 95% success 

with the words on which it had been trained. 

It was also 77% correct on a further 20,000 

words. Thus, the network seemed to have 

learned the ﬁrules of English pronunciationﬂ 

without having explicit rules for combining 

and encoding sounds.
Several connectionist models (e.g., the 
parallel distributed processing approach of 

Rumelhart, McClelland, & The PDP Research 

Group, 1986) assume that representations are 

stored in a 
distributed
 fashion. This assumption 
is often justi˚ ed by arguing that the assumption 

of distributed representations is biologically 

plausible. However, there are problems with 

this assumption. Suppose we try to encode two 

words at the same time. That would cause 

numerous units or nodes to become activated, 

but it would be hard (or even impossible) to 

decide which units or nodes belonged to which 

word (Bowers, 2002). There is also evidence 

that much information is stored in a given 

location in the brain rather than in a distributed 

fashion (see Bowers, 2009, for a review). For 

example, Quiroga, Reddy, Kreiman, Koch, and 

Fried (2005) discovered a neuron in the medial 

temporal lobe that responded strongly when 

pictures of the actress Jennifer Aniston were 

presented but not when pictures of other famous  

people were presented (see Chapter 3).
Some connectionist models assume there 
is
 local
 representation of knowledge. Localist 

connectionist models include the reading model

Third, it was necessary with most early 
computational models to program explicitly 

all aspects of the model, and such mode"

knowledge (e.g., about a word or concept) is 

represented in a 
distributed
 fashion in the brain 

rather than in a speci˚
 c location. Problems 
with that view were discussed earlier and are 

discussed further in Chapter 7.
Fifth, the scope of computational cognitive 
science has increased progressively. Initially, 

computational modelling was often applied 
This was a weakness in the version of ACT-R 

considered by Anderson and Lebiere (2003), but 

the 2004 version (Anderson et al., 2004) has made 

substantial progress in that area. Connectionist 

theorists often claim that connectionist process-

ing units resemble biolo
gical 
neurons, but this 
claim is hotly disputed (see below).
Evaluation
Computational cognitive science has various 

strengths. First, it requires theorists to think 

carefully and rigorously. This is so because 

a computer program has to contain detailed 

information about the processes involved in 

performing any given task. Second, and perhaps  

of greatest importance, the development of 

cognitive architectures offers the prospect of 

providing an overarching framework within 

which to make sense of the workings of the 

cognitive system. It would clearly be extremely 

valuable to have such a framework. This is 

especially the case given that much empirical 

research in cognitive psychology is limited in

the human brain. For example, it is assumed 
in many connectionist models that the basic 

processing units are like biological neurons, 

and that these processing units resemble neurons 

in being massively interconnected. However, the 

resemblances are super˚ cial. There are 100 
Œ150  
billion neurons in the human brain compared 

to no more than a few thousand units in most 

connectionist networks. There are 12 different 

kinds of neuron in the human neocortex 

(Churchland & Sejnowski, 1994), and it is not 

clear which type or types most resemble the 

processing units. In addition, each cortical 

neuron is connected to only about 3% of 

neurons in the surrounding square millimetre 

of cortex (Churchland & Sejnowski, 1994), 

which does not even approximate to massive 

interconnectivity.
Third, many computational models contain 
many parameters or variables. It is often argued 

that theorists can adjust these parameters to 

produce almost any outcome they want Œ 

ﬁparameter tweakingﬂ. However, it is important 

not to exaggerate the problem. In practice, the 

assumptions built into a computational model 

need to be plausible in the light of all the 

available evidence, and so it is not really a 

question of ﬁanything goesﬂ at all.
Fourth, human cognition is in˜
 uenced by 
several potentially con˜
 icting motivational 
and emotional factors, many of which may be 

operative at the same time. Most computa-

tional models ignore "
Segment_55,"these factors, although   ACT-R (Anderson et al., 2004) does include a   motivational component in its goal module.

More generally, we can distinguish between a

and a biological system (the Regulatory System) 

(Norman, 1980). Much of the activity of 

the Pure Cognitive System is determined by 

the various needs of the Regulatory System, 

including the need for survival, for food 

and water, and for protection of oneself and

however, there has been the development of 

computational cognitive neuroscience devoted 

to the application of computational modelling 

to functional neuroimaging data. Indeed, the 

Brain Research
 journal in 2007 devoted a special 

issue to this research area (see Preface by Becker, 

2007). In addition, as we have seen, Anderson 

et al.™s (2004) ACT-R makes considerable use 

of ˚
 ndings from functional neuroimaging. 
Applications of computational modelling to data 

in cognitive neuropsychology were considered in 

a special issue of the 
Cognitive Neuropsychology
 
journal in 2008 (see Introduction by Dell and 

Caramazza, 2008).
Sixth, computational cognitive science 
(especially connectionism) is well equipped to 

provide powerful theoretical accounts of parallel 

processing systems. This is important for two 

reasons. First, there is convincing evidence 

(much of it from functional neuroimaging 

research) indicating that parallel processing is 

the rule rather than the exception. Second, 

making sense of parallel processing systems 

seems more dif˚ cult within other approaches 

(e.g., cognitive neuropsychology).
What are the main limitations of the 
computational cognitive science approach?

is this the case? One reason is that there are 

many levels of detail at which a model can

model can capture the direction of a difference 

in correct responses between two groups of

and error responses of groups, general trends 

in response times for all response types, and 

so on (Costello & Keane, 2000). Many models 

operate at the more general end of these 

possible parallels, which makes them weak 

predictively.

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
COMPARISON OF MAJOR 
APPROACHES
We have discussed the major approaches to 
human cognition at length, and you may be 

wondering which one is the most useful and 

informative. In fact, that is not the best way 

of thinking about the issues for various reasons. 

First, an increasing amount of research involves 

two or more of the approaches. For example, 

most tasks used in cognitive neuropsychology 

and functional neuroimaging studies were ori-

ginally developed by experimental cognitive 

psychologists. Another example concerns a 

study by Rees, Wojciulik, Clarke, Husain, Frith, 

and Driver (2000) on patients suffering from 

extinction (see Chapter 5). In this disorder, visual 

stimuli presented to the side of space opposite 

to the site of brain damage are not detected 
when a second stimulus is presented at the 

same time to the same side as the brain damage. 

Rees et al. found using fMRI that extinguished 

stimuli produced reasonable levels of activ"

in various areas within the visual cortex. Here, 

a 
combination
 of cognitive neuro 
psychology and 
functional neuroimaging revealed 
that extinguished 
stimuli receive a moderate amount of processing. 

Finally, computational modelling is being 

increasingly applied to data from functional 

neuroimaging and cognitive neuropsychology.
Second, each approach makes its own 
distinctive contribution, and so all are needed. 

In terms of an analogy, it is pointless to ask 

whether a driver is more or less useful than a 

putter to a golfer Œ they are both essential.
Third, as well as its own strengths, each 
approach also has its own limitations. This can

cognitive psychology is that virtually all the 

processes and structures of the cognitive system 

are interdependent. Consider, for example, the 
case of a student

 a book to prepare 

for an examination. The student is

but there are several other processes going on 

as well.

and there is

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
†
 Introduction
Historically, cognitive psychology was uni˚
 ed by an approach based on an analogy between 
the mind and the computer. This information-processing approach viewed the mind as a 
general-purpose, symbol-processing system of limited capacity. Today, there are four main 

approaches to human cognition: experimental cognitive psychology; cognitive neuro-

science; cognitive neuropsychology; and computation"
Segment_60,"al cognitive science. However, the four   approaches are increasingly combined with information from behaviour and brain activity   being integrated. †  Experimental cognitive psychology Cognitive psychologists assume that top-down and bottom-up processes are both involved   in the performance of co",Explores how awareness influences cognition.,"emotion, recognition, attention",Nested under Chapter on perception,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in perception,Aligned with contemporary studies on awareness,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_81,"al cognitive science. However, the four 

approaches are increasingly combined with information from behaviour and brain activity 

being integrated.
†
 Experimental cognitive psychology
Cognitive psychologists assume that top-down and bottom-up processes are both involved 

in the performance of cognitive tasks. These processes can be serial or parallel. Various 
methods (e.g., latent-variable analysis) have been used to address the task impurity problem.
 
In spite of the enormous contribution made by cognitive psychology, it sometimes lacks 

ecological validity, suffers from paradigm speci˚ city, and possesses theoretical vagueness.
†
 Cognitive neuroscience: the brain in action
Cognitive neuroscientists study the brain as well as behaviour. They use various techniques 

varying in their spatial and temporal resolution. Functional neuroimaging techniques provide
 
basically correlational evidence, but TMS can indicate that a given brain area 
is necessarily 

involved in a particular cognitive function. Functional neuroimaging is generally most useful 

when the focus is on brain areas organised in functionally discrete ways. However, it is 

increasingly possible to study integrated processing across different brain areas. Cognitive 

neuroscience has contributed much to the resolution of theoretical issues. More research is  

needed into possible problems with ecological validity with studies using MRI scanners.
†
 Cognitiveneuropsychology
Cognitive neuropsychology is based on various assumptions, including modularity, ana-
tomical modularity
, uniformity of functional architecture, and subtractivity. The existence 
of a double dissociation provides some evidence for two separate modules or systems. 

Single-case studies are generally preferable to group studies, because different patients 

rarely have the same pattern of de˚ cits. The multiple single-patient study method can prove 

more interpretable than the single-case study method. The cognitive neurops"

aspects of the cognitive system, there is an 

emphasis in this book on the ways in which 

each process (e.g., perception) depends on other 

processes and structures (e.g., attention, long-

term memory). This should aid the task of 

making sense of the complexities of the human 

cognitive system.

Comparisons of major approaches

The major approaches are increasingly used in combination. Each approach has its own

strengths and limitations, which makes it useful to use converging operations. When two

approaches produce the same ˚ ndings, this is stronger evidence than can be obtained
from a single approach on its own. If two approaches produce different ˚ 
ndings, this is
an indication that further research is needed to clarify what is happening.

VISUAL PERCEPTION AND 
ATTENTION
Visual perception is of enormous importance in 
our everyday lives. It allows us to move around 

freely, to see people with whom we are inter-

acting, to read magazines and books, to admire 

the wonders of nature, and to watch Þ
 lms and 
television. It is also enormously important 

because we depend on visual perception being 

accurate to ensure our survival. For example, 

if we misperceive how close cars are to us 

as we cross the road, the consequences could 

be fatal. Thus, it is no surprise that far more 

of the cortex (especially the occipital lobes) is 

devoted to vision than to any other sensory 

modality.
We will start by considering what is meant 
by 
perception
: ÒThe acquisition and processing  
of sensory information in order to see, hear, 

taste, or feel objects in the world also guides 

an organismÕs actions with respect to those 

objectsÓ (Sekuler & Blake, 2002, p. 621). Visual 

perception seems so simple and effortless 

that we typically take it for granted. In fact, 

it is very complex, and numerous processes 

are involved in transforming and interpreting 

sensory information. Some of the complex-

i t ies of visual perception became clear when 

researchers in artiÞ cial intelligence tried to pro-

gram computers to ÒperceiveÓ the environment. 

Even when the environment was artiÞ
 cially 
simpliÞ
 ed (e.g.,"

and the task was apparently easy (e.g., deciding 

how many objects were present), computers 

required very complicated programming to 

succeed. It remains the case that no computer 
can match more than a fraction of the skills 

of visual perception possessed by nearly every 

adult human.
As the authors have discovered to their 
cost, there is a rapidly growing literature on 

visual perception, especially from the cognitive 

neuroscience perspective. What we have tried 

to do over the next three chapters is to pro-

vide reasonably detailed coverage of the main 

issues. In Chapter 2, our coverage of visual 

perception focuses on a discussion of basic 

processes, emphasising the enormous advances 

that have been made in understanding the vari-

ous brain systems involved. It is common-

sensical to assume that the same processes that 

lead to object recognition also guide vision 

for action. However, there are strong grounds 

for arguing that somewhat different processes 

are involved. Finally, Chapter 2 contains a 

detailed consideration of important aspects of 

visual perception, including colour perception, 

perception without awareness, and depth and 

size perception.
One of the major achievements of per-
ceptual processing is object recognition, which 

involves identifying the objects in the world 

around us. The central focus of Chapter 3 is 

on the processes underlying this achievement. 

Initially, we discuss perceptual organisation, 

and the ways in which we decide which parts of 

the visual information presented to us belong 

together and so form an object. We then move 

on to theories of object recognition, including 

a discussion of the relevant evidence from

to an object to perceive it consciously. Issues 

relating directly to attention are considered in 

detail in Chapter 5. In that chapter, we start by 

considering the processes involved in focused 

attention in the visual and auditory modali-

ties. After that, we consider how we use visual 

processes when engaged in the everyday task of 

searching for some object (e.g., a pair of socks 

in a drawer). There has been a large increase 

in the amount of research concerned with dis-

orders of visual attention, and this research has 

greatly increased our understanding of visual 

attention in healthy individuals. Finally, as we 

all know to our cost, it can be very hard to 

do two things at once. We conclude Chapter 

5 by considering the factors determining the 

extent to which we do this successfully or 

unsuccessfully.
In sum, the area spanning visual percep-
tion and attention is among the most exciting 

and important within cognitive psychology and 

cognitive neuroscience. There has been tremen-

dous progress in unravelling the complexities of 

perception and attention over the past decade, 

and some of the choicest fruits of that endea-

brain-damaged patients.
Are the same recognition processes used 
regardless of the type of object? This is a con-

troversial issue, but many experts have argued 

that face recognition differs in important ways 

from ordinary object recognition. Accordingly, 

face recognition is discussed separately. The 

Þ
 nal part of Chapter 3 is devoted to another 
major controversial issue, namely, whether the 

processes involved in visual imagery are the 

same as those involved in visual perception. As 

we will see, there are good grounds for arguing  

that this controversy has been resolved (turn 

to Chapter 3 to Þ nd out how!).

of our perceptual goals. For example, we can 
sometimes perceive the gist of a natural scene 

extremely rapidly (Thorpe, Fize, & Marlot 1996).  

Observers saw photographs containing or 

not containing an animal for only 20 ms. EEG  

revealed that the presence of an animal was 

detected within about 150 ms. In contrast, have 

a look at the photograph shown in Figure 2.1, 

and try to decide how many animals are 
present. 

You probably found that it took 
several seconds 
to develop a full understanding 
of the picture. 
Bear in mind the diversity of visual percep-

tion as you read this and the two following 

chapters.
BRAIN SYSTEMS
In this section, we focus mainly on brain sys-

tems involved in visual perception. The visual 

cortex is very large, covering about 20% of 

the entire cortex. It includes the whole of the 

occipital cortex at the back of the brain and 

also extends well into the temporal and parietal 

lobes ( Wandell, Dumoulin, & Brewer, 2007). 

However, to understand fully visual processing 

in the brain, we need Þ rst to consider brieß
 y 
what happens between the eye and the cortex. 

Accordingly, we start with that before discuss-

neuroscientists, thanks to whom we now have 

a reasonable knowledge of the brain systems 

involved in visual perception. We start by con-

sidering the main brain areas involved in vision 

and the functions served by each area. After 

that, some theories of brain systems in vision 

are discussed. Next, we consider the issue of 

whether perception can occur in the absence of 

conscious awareness. Finally, there is a detailed 

analysis of basic aspects of visual perception 

(e.g., colour processing, depth processing).
Chapter 3 focuses mostly on the processes 
involved in object recognition and in face recog-

nition. For purposes of exposition, we generally  

deal with a single aspect of visual perception 

in any given section. However, it is important 

to realise that all the processes involved in 

visual perception interact with each other. In 

that connection, Hegd” (2008) has provided a 

very useful overview. He emphasised the point 

that visual perception develops over time even 

though it may seem to be instantaneous. More 

speciÞ
 cally, visual processing typically proceeds 
in a coarse-to-Þ ne way, so that it can take a 

considerable amount of time to perceive all the 

details in a scene.
Hegd” (2008) also pointed out that the 
processes involved differ considerably depend-

ing on what we are looking at and the nature

There is another important feature of the 
retinaÐgeniculateÐstriate system. There are two  

relatively independent channels or pathway 

within this system:
The parvocellular (or P) pathway
(1) 
: this 
pathway is most sensitive to colour and 

to Þ ne detail; most of its input comes 
from cones.

The magnocellular (or M) pathway
(2) 
: this 
pathway is most sensitive to information 

about movement; most of its input comes 

from rods.
It is important to note (as stated above) that 

these two pathways are only 
relatively
 inde-
pendent. There is plentiful evidence that there 

are numerous interconnections between the 

two pathways, and it is becoming increasingly 

apparent that the visual system is extremely 

complex (Mather, 2009). For example, there is
 
clear 
evidence of intermingling of the two path-
ways in V1 (Nassi & Callaway, 2006, 2009).
much activity in retinal ganglion cells in poor 

lighting conditions.
The main pathway between the eye and the 
cortex is the retinaÐgeniculateÐstriate pathway. 

It transmits information from the retina to V1 

and then V2 (these are both visual areas dis-

cussed shortly) via the lateral geniculate nuclei 

of the thalamus. The entire retinaÐgeniculateÐ

striate system is organised in a similar way 

to the retinal system. Thus, for example, two 

stimuli adjacent to each other in the retinal 

image will also be adjacent to each other at 

higher levels within that system.
Each eye has its own optic nerve, and the 
two optic nerves meet at the optic chiasma. 

At this point, the axons from the outer halves 

of each retina proceed to the hemisphere on 

the same side, whereas the axons from the 

inner halves cross over and go to the other 

hemisphere. Signals then proceed along two 

optic tracts within the brain. One tract con-

tains signals from the left half of each eye, 

and the other signals from the right half (see"
Segment_70,"Figure 2.3). After the optic chiasma, the optic tract pro- ceeds to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN),   which is part of the thalamus.

mainly concerned with form and colour 
processing, whereas the dorsal (ﬁwhereﬂ 

or ﬁhowﬂ) pathway culminating in the 

parietal cortex is more concerned with 

movement processing.

There is by no means an absolutely rigid 
(2) 
distinction between the types of infor-

mation processed by the two streams. 

For example, Gur and Snodderly (2007) 

discovered a pathway by which motion-

relevant information reaches the ventral 

stream directly without involving the 

dorsal stream.

The two pathways are 
(3) 
not
 totally segre-
gated. There are many interconnections 

between the ventral and dorsal pathways 

or streams. For example, both streams 

project to the primary motor cortex 

(Rossetti & Pisella, 2002).
As already indicated, Figure 2.4 provides 
only a very rough sketch map of visual pro-

cessing in the brain. We can obtain more 
precise information from Figure 2.5, which 

is based on data from single-unit recordings 

(Schmolesky et al., 1998). This reveals three 

important points. First, the interconnections 

among the various visual cortical areas are 

more complicated than implied so far
. Second, 
the brain areas forming part of the ventral 

pathway or stream are more than twice as 

large as th"

fastest when a visual stimulus is presented 

followed by activation of cells in V1. How-

ever, cells are activated in several other areas 

(V3/ V3A; MT; MST) very shortly thereafter. 

The take-home message is that it makes sense 

to think in terms of two pathways or pro-

cessing streams, but these pathways are not 

separated in a neat and tidy way from each 

other.
V1 and V2
We will start with three important general 

points. First, to understand visual processing 

in primary visual cortex (V1) and in secondary  
Brain systems
As we have just seen, neurons from the P 

and M pathways mainly project to V1 in the 

primary visual cortex. What happens after 

V1? The answer is given in Figure 2.4. The P 

pathway associates with the ventral or ﬁwhatﬂ 

pathway that proceeds to the inferotemporal 

cortex, passing through an area (V4) involved 

in colour processing. In contrast, the M 

pathway associates with the dorsal (ﬁwhereﬂ 

or ﬁhowﬂ) pathway that proceeds to the 

p osterior parietal cortex, passing through an 

area (V5/MT) involved in visual motion pro-

cessing. Note that the assertions in the last 

two sentences are both only a very approxi-

mate re˜ ection of a complex reality. For 

example, some parvocellular neurons project 

into dorsal visual areas (see Parker, 2007, for 

a review).
We will be considering the two pathways 
in much more detail later. For now, there are 

three points to bear in mind:

response as a function of differences in orienta-
tion and size.
Much of our knowledge of neurons (and 
their receptive Þ elds) in primary and second-

ary visual cortex comes from the Nobel prize-

winning research of Hubel and Wiesel. They 

used single-unit recordings (see Chapter 1) 

to study individual neurons. They found that 

many cells responded in two different ways to 

a spot of light depending on which part of the 

cell was affected:
visual cortex (V2), we must consider the notion 

of 
receptive Þ
 eld
. The receptive Þ eld for any 
given neuron is that region of the retina in 

which light affects its activity.
Second, neurons often have effects on each 
other. For example, there is 
lateral
 
inhibition
, 
in which a reduction of activity in one neuron 

is caused by activity in a neighbouring neuron. 

Why is lateral inhibition useful? It increases 

the 
contrast
 at the edges of objects, making it 
easier to identify the dividing line between one 

object and another.
Third, the primary visual cortex (V1) and 
secondary visual cortex (V2) occupy relatively 

large areas within the cortex (see Figure 2.5). 

There is increasing evidence that early visual 

processing in areas V1 and V2 is more exten-

sive than was once thought. For example, 

Hegd” and Van Essen (2000) studied neuronal 

responses to complex shapes in macaque mon-

keys. Approximately one-third of V2 cells 

responded to complex shapes and varied their

& Brewer, 2007). These maps are very useful 
because they preserve the spatial arrangement of 

the visual image, without which accurate visual 

perception would probably be impossible.
Third, V1 and V2 are both involved in 
the early stages of visual processing. However, 

that is not the complete story. In fact, there is 

an initial Òfeedforward sweepÓ that proceeds 

through the visual areas starting with V1 and 

then V2. In addition, however, there is a sec-

ond phase of processing (recurrent processing) 

in which processing proceeds in the opposite 

direction (Lamme, 2006). There is evidence 

that some recurrent processing can occur in 

V1 within 120 ms of stimulus onset and also 

at later times (Boehler, Schoenfeld, Heinze, 

& Hopf, 2008). Observers were more likely 

to have visual awareness of the stimulus that 

had been presented on trials on which recur-

rent processing was strongly present. This sug-

gests that recurrent processing may be of major 

importance in visual perception (see discussion 

in Chapter 16).
Functional specialisation
Zeki (1992, 1993) put forward a functional 

specialisation theory, a"
Segment_74,"ccording to which dif-  ferent parts of the cortex are specialised for   different visual functions (e.g., colour process-  ing, motion processing, form processing). By   analogy, the visual system resembles a team of   workers, each working on his / her own to solve    part of a complex problem.

different visual functions (e.g., colour process-

ing, motion processing, form processing). By 

analogy, the visual system resembles a team of 

workers, each working on his / her own to solve  

part of a complex problem. The results of their 

labours are then combined to produce the solu-

tion (i.e., coherent visual perception).
Why
 might there be functional specialisa-
tion in the visual brain? Zeki (2005) argued that 

there are two main reasons. First, the attributes 

of objects occur in complex and unpredictable 
An ÒonÓ response, with an increased rate 
(1) 
of Þ ring when the light was on.
An ÒoffÓ response, with the light causing 
(2) 
a decreased rate of Þ
 ring.
ON-centre cells produce the on-response to a 

light in the centre of their receptive Þ
 eld and 
an off-response to a light in the periphery
. The 
opposite is the case with off-centre cells.
Hubel and Wiesel (e.g., 1979) discovered 
two types of neuron in the receptive Þ
 elds 
of the primary visual cortex: simple cells and 

complex cells. Simple cells have ÒonÓ and ÒoffÓ 

regions, with each region being rectangular in 

shape. These cells respond most to dark bars 

in a light Þ eld, light bars in a dark Þ
 eld, or 
straight edges between areas of light and dark. 

Any given simple cell only responds strongly 

to stimuli of a particular orientation, and so 

the responses of these cells could be relevant 

to feature detection.
Complex cells resemble simple cells in that 
they respond maximally to straight-line stimuli 

in a particular orientation. However, complex 

cells have large receptive Þ elds and respond 

more to moving contours. Each complex cell 

is driven by several simple cells having the 

same orientation preference and closely over-

lapping receptive Þ elds (Alonso & Martinez, 

1998). There are also end-stopped cells. The 

responsiveness of these cells depends on stimu-

lus length and on orie"

the primary cortex or area V1. The importance 
of area V1 is shown by the fact that lesions 

at any point along the pathway to it from the 

retina lead to virtually total blindness within 

the affected part of V1. However, areas V2 

to V5 are also of major signiÞ cance in visual 

perception. It is generally assumed that the 

organisation of the human visual system 
closely 

resembles that of the macaque, and so 
reference 
is often made to human brain areas 
such as V1, 

V2, and so on. Technically, however,  
they should 
be referred to as analogue

and so on, because these areas

motion processing requires integrating informa-

in time. In contrast, form or shape processing 

involves considering the relationship of elements  

to each other at one point in time.
Much of our early knowledge of functional 
specialisation in the visual brain came from 

research on monkeys. This is partly because 

certain kinds of experiments (e.g., surgical 

removal of parts of the visual brain) can be 

performed on monkeys but not humans. Some 

of the main areas of the visual cortex in the 

macaque monkey are shown in Figure 2.6. The

Tolerance

: neurons with high tolerance 
respond strongly to retinal images of the 
same object differing due to changes in 

position, size, illumination, and so on.
Zoccolan et al. (2007) found in monkeys 

that those neurons high in object selectivity 

tended to be low in tolerance, and those high 

in tolerance were low in object selectivity. 

What do these Þ 
ndings mean? It is valuable 
to have neurons that are very speciÞ c in their 

responsiveness (i.e., high object selectivity 

+
 low tolerance) and others that respond to far 
more stimuli (i.e., low object selectivity

There is much more on the responsiveness 
of neurons in anterior inferotemporal cortex in 

Chapter 3. If form processing occurs in differ-

ent brain areas from colour and motion pro-

cessing, we might anticipate that some patients 

would have severely impaired form processing 

but intact colour and motion processing. That 

does 
not 
seem to be the case. According to 
Zeki (1992), the reason is that a lesion large 

enough to destroy areas V3, V4, and infero-

temporal cortex would probably destroy area 

V1 as well. As a result, the patient would suffer 

from total blindness rather than simply loss of 

form perception.
Colour processing
Studies involving brain-damaged patients and 

others involving techniques for studying the 

brain (e.g., functional neuroimaging) have been 

used to test the assumption that V4 is specia-

lised for colour processing. We will consider 

these two kinds of study in turn.
If area V4 and related areas are specialised 
for colour processing, then patients with damage 

mostly limited to those areas should show little 

or no colour perception combined with fairly 

normal form and motion percep tion and ability 

to see Þ ne detail. This is approximately the 
V3 and V3A
¥
: Cells in these areas are respon-
sive to form (especially the shapes of objects

in motion) but not to colour.
V4
¥
: The overwhelming majority of cells in
this area are responsive to colour; many

are also responsive to line orientation. This

area in monkeys is unusual in that there is

much mixing of connections from temporal

and parietal cortex (Baizer, Ungerleider
, &
Desimone, 1991).

Relevant human evidence is considered below.
Form processing
Several areas are involved in form processing 

in humans, including areas V1, V2, V3, V4, and  

culminating in inferotemporal cortex. However, 

the cognitive neuroscience approach to form 

perception has focused mainly on inferotem-

poral cortex. For example, Sugase, Yamane, 

Ueno, and Kawano (1999) presented human 

faces, monkey faces, and simple geometrical 

objects (e.g., squares, circles) to monkeys. 

Neural activity occurring 50 ms after stimulus 

presentation varied as a function of the type of 

stimulus presented (e.g., human face vs. monkey 

face). Neural activity occurring several hundred 

milliseconds after stimulus presentation was 

inß
 uenced by more detailed characteristics of 
the stimulus (e.g., facial expression).
Zoccolan, Kouh, Poggio, and DiCarlo 
(2007) argued that neurons in the anterior 

region of the inferotemporal cortex differ in 

two important ways:
Object selectivity
(1) 
: neurons with high object 
selectivity respond mainly or exclusively 

to speciÞc visual objects.

actively involved in colour processing in humans 
in addition to the involvement of area V4.
More detailed research involving single-unit 
recording (see Glossary) has clariÞ ed the role 

of V4 in colour processing. Conway, Moeller, 

and Tsao (2007) identiÞ ed clusters of cells in 

V4 and adjacent areas that responded strongly 

to colour and also showed some responsiveness  

to shape. There were other cells in between

In sum, area V4 and adjacent areas are 
undoubtedly involved in colour processing, as 

has been found in studies on patients with 

achromatopsia and in brain-imaging studies. 

However, the association between colour pro-

cessing and involvement of V4 is not strong 

enough for us to regard it as a Òcolour centreÓ. 

First, there is much evidence that other areas 

(e.g., V1, V2) are also involved in colour pro-

cessing. Second, some ability to process colour 

is present in most individuals with achroma-

topsia. It is also present in monkeys with lesions 

to V4 (Heywood & Cowey, 1999). Third, most 

patients with achromatopsia have deÞ
 cits in 
other visual processing (e.g., spatial processing) 

in addition to colour processing. Fourth, ÒThe 

size of V4 (it is substantially the largest area 

beyond V2) and its anatomical position (it is 

the gateway to the temporal lobe) necessitate 

that it do more than just support colour visionÓ 

(Lennie, 1998, p. 920).
case in some patients with 
achromatopsia
 (also  

known as cerebral achromatopsia). Bouvier 

and Engel (2006) carried out a meta-analysis 

involving all known cases of achromatopsia. 

They reported three main Þ
 ndings:
A small brain area within ventral occipital 
(1) 
cortex in (or close to) area V4 was damaged 

in nearly all cases of achromatopsia.

The loss of colour vision in patients with

achromatopsia was often only partial, with  

some patients performing at normal levels
 
on some tasks involving colour perception.

Most patients with achromatopsia had sub-

that some colour perception is often possible

the only area involved in colour processing. 

The Þ nding that patients with achromatopsia 

typically also have substantial deÞ cits in spatial 

vision suggests that the area is not specialised 

just for colour processing.
Functional neuroimaging evidence that V4 
plays an important role in colour processing 

was reported by Zeki and Marini (1998). They 

presented human observers with pictures of 

normally coloured objects (e.g., red straw-

berries), abnormally coloured objects (e.g., blue  

strawberries), and black-and-white pictures of 

objects. Functional magnetic resonance imag-

ing (fMRI; see Glossary) indicated that both 

kinds of coloured objects activated a pathway 

going from V1 to V4. In addition, abnormally 

coloured objects (but not normally coloured 

ones) led to activation in the dorsolateral pre-

frontal cortex. A reasonable interpretation of 

these Þ ndings is that higher-level cognitive 

processes associated with the dorsolateral pre-

frontal cortex were involved when the objectÕs 

colour was unexpected or surprising.
Similar Þ ndings were reported by Wade, 
Brewer, Rieger, and Wandell (2002). They used  

fMRI, and found that areas V1 and V2 were 
achromatopsia:
 this is a condition involving 
brain damage in which there is little or no 

colour perception, but form and motion 

perception are relatively intact.

V5 (MT) is not the only area involved in 
motion processing. Another area that is involved 
is area MST (medial superior 
temporal), which is 
adjacent to and just above V5/MT. Vaina (1998) 
Motion processing
Area V5 (also known as MT, standing for median 

or middle temporal) is heavily involved in motion 

processing. Anderson et al. (1996) used magneto-

encephalography (MEG) and fMRI (see Glossary) 

to assess brain activity in response to motion 

stimuli. They reported that, Òhuman V5 is located 

near the occipitoÐtemporal border in a minor 

sulcus (groove) immediately below the superior 

temporal sulcusÓ (p. 428). This is consistent 

with other Þ ndings. For example, Zeki, Watson, 

Lueck, Friston, Kennard, and Frackowiak (1991) 

used PET (see Glossary) and found that V5 (or 

MT) became very active when observers viewed 

moving dots relative to static ones.
Functional neuroimaging studies indicate 
that motion processing is associated with activity 

in V5 (or MT), but do not show clearly that 

V5 (or MT) is 
necessary
 for motion perception. 

This issue was addressed by Beckers and Zeki 

(1995). They used transcranial magnetic stimu-

lation (TMS; see Glossary) to disrupt activity in  

V5/MT. This almost eliminated motion percep-

tion. McKeefry, Burton, Vakrou, Barrett, and 

Morland (2008) also used TMS. When TMS 

was applied to V5/MT, it produced a subjective 

slowing of stimulus speed and impaired the 

ability to discriminate between different speeds.  

Additional evidence that area V5/MT is of major 

importance in motion processing comes from 

studies on patients with akinetopsia.

22 patients with a deÞ cit in perception of Þ
 rst-
order motion but not of second-order motion, 
and one patient with a deÞ cit only in perception 

of second-order motion. This double dissocia-

tion indicates that different processes may well 

be involved in perception of the two types 

of motion. Of interest, many of the patients 

had brain damage not limited to the so-called 

motion areas, suggesting that several brain 

areas are involved in perception of motion.
Much of the brain research on motion 
perception has involved monkeys rather than 

humans. We need to be careful about generalis-

ing from such research to humans, because 

more brain areas are involved in human motion 

perception. Orban et al. (2003) found in an fMRI 

study that motion stimuli caused activation in 

V5/MT and surrounding areas in humans and 

in monkeys. However, area V3A and several 

other regions were more activated in humans 

than in monkeys. Of relevance, McKeefry et al.

Speculatively, Orban et al. (2003, p. 1766) pro-

the control of motion (e.g., primitive ways of 

making Þ
 re)  .  .  .  this is also true for hunting 
with primitive weapons  .  .  .  motion processing 

became behaviourally much more important 

when humans emerged from the primate family 

millions of years ago.Ó
Binding problem
ZekiÕs functional specialisation approach 

poses the obvious problem of how information 

about an objectÕs motion, colour, and form is 

combined and integrated to produce coherent 

perception. This is known as the 
binding problem
: 
studied two patients with damage to MST. 
Both 
patients performed normally on some 
tests of 
motion perception, but had various problems 

relating to motion perception. One patient (RR) 

Òfrequently bumped into people, corners and 

things in his way, particularly into moving targets 

(e.g., people walking)Ó (p. 498). These Þ
 ndings  
suggest that MST is involved in the visual 

guidance of walking (Sekuler & Blake, 2002).
There is an important distinction between 
Þ
 rst-order and second-
order motion perception 
(Cavanagh & Mather, 1989). With Þ
 rst-order 
displays, the moving shape differs in luminance 

(emitted or reß
 ected light) 
from its background. 
For example, the shape might be dark whereas 

the background is light (a shadow passing over 

the ground). With second-order displays, there is  

no difference in luminance between the moving 

shape and the background, and we need to take 

account of other changes (e.g., contrast changes) 

to perceive motion. In everyday life, we encounter  

second-order displays fairly infrequently (e.g., 

movement of grass in a Þ
 eld caused by the wind).
There has been theoretical controversy con-
cerning "
Segment_84,"whether different mechanisms underlie   the perception of Þ  rst-order and second-order  motion. There is increasing evidence that dif-  ferent mechanisms are involved. Ashida, Lingnau,    Wall, and Smith (2007) found that repeated   presentation of Þ rst-order displays led to a   substantial reduct",Explores how memory influences cognition.,"perception, memory, emotion",Nested under Chapter on attention,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in memory,Aligned with contemporary studies on attention,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_1115,"whether different mechanisms underlie 

the perception of Þ
 rst-order and second-order 
motion. There is increasing evidence that dif-

ferent mechanisms are involved. Ashida, Lingnau,  

Wall, and Smith (2007) found that repeated 

presentation of Þ rst-order displays led to a 

substantial reduction in activation in motion 

areas MT and MST. This is known as adaptation 

and occurs because many of the same neurons 

are activated by each display. Very similar 

reductions in activation in the motion areas 

occurred with repeated presentations of second-

order displays. However, the key Þ
 nding was 
that there was 
no
 evidence of adapta tion in MT 

and MST when Þ rst-order displays were followed 

by second-order displays or vice versa. The 

implication is that the two kinds of stimuli 

activated 
different
 sets of neurons and thus 
probably involved different processes.
Support for the notion of different mecha-
nisms for perception of Þ rst-order and second-

order was also reported by Rizzo, Nawrot, Sparks, 

and Dawson (2008). They studied patients with 

brain damage in the visual cortex. There were

distributed areas of the brain and proceeds 
through several stages. This makes it implau-

sible that precise synchrony could be achieved. 

Another problem is that two or more objects 

are often presented at the same time. On the 

synchrony hypothesis, it would seem hard to 

keep the processing of these objects separate. 

Guttman, Gilroy, and Blake (2007) have sug-

gested an alternative hypothesis based on the 

notion that perception depends on 
patterns
 of 

neural activity over time rather than on precise 

synchrony.

As is discussed in more detail later, there are   strong grounds for agreeing with Zeki that   processing of motion typically proceeds some-  what independently of",Explores how recognition influences cognition.,"attention, memory, awareness",Nested under Chapter on awareness,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in memory,Aligned with contemporary studies on perception,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_315," been inß uential. It represents an 

interesting attempt to provide a relatively sim-

ple overview of a remarkably complex reality. 

As is discussed in more detail later, there are 

strong grounds for agreeing with Zeki that 

processing of motion typically proceeds some-

what independently of other types of visual 

processing.
There are three major limitations with 
ZekiÕs theoretical approach. First, the various 

brain areas involved in visual processing are 

not nearly as specialised and limited in their 

processing as implied by the theory. Heywood 

and Cowey (1999) considered the percentage of 

cells in each visual cortical area that responded 

selectively to various stimulus characteristics 

(see Figure 2.7). Cells in several areas respond 

to orientation, disparity, and colour. There is 

reasonable evidence for specialisation only 

with respect to responsiveness to direction of 

stimulus motion.
Second, early visual processing in areas V1 
and V2 is more extensive than suggested by 

Zeki. As we saw earlier, Hegde and Van Essen 

(2000) found that many V2 cells in macaque 

monkeys responded to complex shapes.
Third, Zeki has not addressed the binding 
problem satisfactorily. This problem is more 

tractable if we discard the functional specialisa-

tion assumption and assume instead that there 

are numerous interactions among the brain 

areas involved in visual processing (Kourtzi 

et al., 2008).
Òlocal, spatially distributed features 
(e.g., colour, 

motion) must be grouped into coherent,
 global 
objects that are segmented from one another 

and from the backgrounds against which they 

appearÓ (Guttman, Gilroy, & Blake, 2007).
One approach to the binding problem is to 
argue that there is less functional specialisation 

than Zeki claimed, which reduces the complexity 

of the problem. For example, Kourtzi, Krekelberg, 

and van Wezel (2008) argued that there are 

numerous interactions between brain regions

Lubbe, Lommers, and van Wright (2007) studied 

activation to static pictures of running humans 

in areas of the visual cortex involved in motion 

processing. There was signiÞ
 cant activation in 
those areas, but it was reduced when participants 

had previously been exposed to real motion in 

the same direction as the implied motion. These 

Þ
 ndings suggest that form and motion are pro-
cessed in the same areas of cortex.
A different approach to the binding problem 
is the synchrony hypothesis (Canales, GŠmez, 

& Maffet, 2007). According to this hypothesis, 

the presentation of a given object leads to wide-

spread visual processing, and coherent visual 

perception depends upon a 
synchronisation
 
of neural activity across several cortical areas. 

O f  some relevance, there is evidence that 

widespread 
synchronisation of neural activity 
is associated with conscious visual awareness 

(e.g., Melloni et 
al., 2007; Rodriguez, George, 
Lachaux, 
Martinerie, 
Renault, & Varela, 1999; 
see Chapter 16). However, this association does  

not demonstrate that synchronisation 
causes
 

conscious perception. Negative evidence was 

reported by Moutoussis and Zeki (1997) and 

by Bartels and Zeki (2004). Moutoussis and 

Zeki found that colour was perceived about 

80Ð100 ms before motion, which suggests a 

lack of synchrony. Bartels and Zeki found that 

there was a 
reduction
 in synchrony across the 

brain when participants who had been in a 

resting state were presented with the Bond 

movie, 
Tomorrow Never Dies
.
The synchrony hypothesis is oversimpliÞ
 ed.

its orientation and position with respect to 

ourselves. Since observers and objects often 

move with respect to each other, it is important 

that the calculations of orientation and posi-

tion are done immediately prior to initiating 

a movement.
Norman (2002) put forward a dual-process 
approach resembling the perceptionÐaction 

theory of Milner and Goodale (1995, 1998). 

He agreed with Milner and Goodale that there 

are separate ventral and dorsal pathways. He 

also agreed that the functions of each pathway 

were basically those proposed by Milner and 

Goodale. In broad terms, the functions of the 

two pathways or systems are as follows: ÒThe 

dorsal system deals mainly with the utilisa-

tion of visual information for the guidance of 

behaviour in oneÕs environment. The ventral 

system deals mainly with the utilisation of 

visual information for ÔknowingÕ oneÕs environ-

ment, that is, identifying and recognising items 
TWO VISUAL SYSTEMS: 
PERCEPTION AND ACTION
A fundamental question in vision research is as 
follows: what is the major function of vision? 

As Milner and Goodale (1998, p. 2) pointed 

out, ÒStandard accounts of vision implicitly 

assume that the purpose of the visual system 

is to construct some sort of internal model of 

the world outside.Ó That assumption may seem 

reasonable but is probably inadequate.
One of the most inß
 uential answers to the 
above question was provided by Milner and 

Goodale (e.g., 1995, 1998). They argued there 

are 
two
 visual systems, each fulÞ lling a different  
function. First, there is a vision-for-perception 

system based on the ventral pathway; see 

Figure 2.4), which is the one we immediately 

think of when considering visual perception. It 

is the system we use to decide that the animal 

in front of us is a cat or a buffalo or to admire 

a magniÞ cent landscape. In othe"

between the two theoretical approaches. Since 
more research has focused on perceptionÐaction 

theory, our focus will be on that theory.
Experimental evidence: 
brain-damaged patients
We can test Milner and GoodaleÕs perceptionÐ
action theory and NormanÕs dual-process approach 

by studying brain-damaged patients. We would 

expect to Þ nd some patients (those with damage 

to the dorsal pathway) having reasonably intact 
previously encountered and storing new visual 

information for later encountersÓ (Norman, 

2002, p. 95).
We can understand the essence of the dual-
process approach if we consider the various dif-

ferences assumed by Norman to exist between 

the two processing systems (see Table 2.1).
NormanÕs (2002) dual-process approach 
provides a more detailed account of differences 

between the ventral and dorsal systems than 

Milner and GoodaleÕs (1995, 1998) perceptionÐ

action theory. However, there is much overlap

2 BASIC PROCESSES IN VISUAL PERCEPTION 
49
Jakobson, Archibald, Carey, and Goodale (1991) 
studied VK, a patient with optic ataxia who had 

difÞ
 culty in grasping objects. Close 
inspection 
of her grip aperture at different points 
in grasp-

ing indicated that her 
initial
 planning was 

essentially normal.
What about patients with damage to the 
ventral stream only? Of relevance here are some  

patients with 
visual agnosia
, a condition involv-
ing severe problems with object recognition 

even though visual information reaches the 

cortex (see Chapter 3). Perhaps the most studied 

visual agnosic is DF. James, Culham, Humphrey, 

Milner, and Goodale (2003) found that her 
vision for perception but 
severely impaired vision 

for action. There should 
also be other patients 
(those with damage to the ventral pathway) 

showing the 
opposite pattern of intact vision 

for action but very 
poor vision for perception. 
There should thus be a double dissociation (see 

Glossary).
Of relevance to the theory are patients with 
optic ataxia, who have damage to the dorsal 

pathway, especially the intra parietal sulcus and 

the superior parietal lobule (see Figure 2.8).

Many patients with optic ataxia do not

 aspects of reaching for

at action planning than at the subsequent 

production of appropriate motor movements.

assessed DFÕs performance on various tasks 
when presented with several differently coloured  

objects. There were two main Þ
 ndings. First, 
DF could not distinguish accurately between 

the coloured objects, suggesting problems 

with object recognition due to damage to the 

ventral stream. Second, DF reached out and

individuals using information about their 

positions relative to her own body. This sug-

There have been hundreds of studies of visual

brain damage was in the ventral pathway or 

stream (see Figure 2.9). DF showed no greater 

activation in the ventral stream when presented 

with drawings of objects than when presented 

with scrambled line drawings. How ever, she 

showed high levels of activation in the dorsal 

stream when grasping for objects.
In spite of having reasonable visual 
acuity, DF could not identify any of a series 

of drawings of common objects. However, as 

pointed out by Milner et al. (1991, p. 424), 

DF Òhad little difÞ culty in everyday activity 

such as opening doors, shaking hands, walk-

ing around furniture, and eating meals  .  .  .  she 

could accurately reach out and grasp a pencil 

orientated at different angles.Ó
In a study by Goodale and Milner (1992), 
DF held a card in her hand and looked at a 

circular block into which a slot had been cut. 

She was unable to orient the card so it would 

Þ
 t into the slot, suggesting that she had very 
poor perceptual skills. However, DF performed 

well when asked to move her hand forward 

and insert the card into the slot.

processes are apparently very prone to error? 

Milner and Goodale (1995, 2006) provided 

a neat explanation. According to them, most 

studies on visual illusions have involved the 

vision-for-perception system. However, we 

use mostly the vision-for-action system when 

avoiding walking too close to a precipice or 

dodging cars as we cross the road. Milner 

and Goodale argued that the vision-for-action 

system provides accurate information about 

our position with respect to objects. These 

ideas produce an exciting prediction: grasp-

ing for objects using the vision-for-action 


Lyer, the Ebbinghaus, and many other visual 

illusions.
Numerous studies support the above 
prediction. For example, Haart, Carey, and 

Milne (1999) used a three-dimensional version  

yer illusion. There were two 

tasks:
A matching task in which participants 
(1) 
indicated the length of the shaft on one 

Þ
 gure by the size of the gap between 
their index Þ 
nger and thumb. This task 
was designed to require the vision-for-

perception system.

A grasping task, in which participants 
(2) 
rapidly grasped the target Þ
 gure length-
wise using their index Þ 
nger and thumb. 
This task was designed to use the vision-

for-action system.
What Haart et al. (1999) found is shown 
in Figure 2.12. There was a strong illusion 

effect when the matching task was used. More 

interestingly, there was 
no
 illusory effect at all 

with the grasping task.

longer than the one on the right. In fact, 

however, they are the same length, as can be

yer or related illusions in which 
observers had to point rapidly at the Þ
 gure. 
These studies were designed to involve the vision-

for-action system, and the mean illusion effect 

was 5.5%. For comparison purposes, they con-

sidered 11 studies using standard procedures 

(e.g., verbal estimations of length) and designed 

to involve the vision-for-perception system. Here, 

the mean illusion effect was 22.4%. The Þ
 nding 
that the mean illusion effect was 
four
 times 

greater in the former studies clearly supports 

the perceptionÐaction model. However, it could 

be argued that the model predicts no illusion 

effect at all with rapid pointing.
Action: planning 
+
 motor responses
A study by KrŠliczak et al. (2006; see Box) 

found that some motor movements (slow 

pointing) were much more affected by the 

hollow-face illusion than were different motor 

movements (fast ß icking). How can we best 

explain this difference? The starting point is 

to realise that the processes involved in pro-

ducing different actions can vary substantially. 
The hollow-face illusion
Many studies have shown that visual illusion 

effects are reduced (or disappear altogether) 

when observers make rapid reaching or grasp-

ing movements towards illusory ˚ gures.This is 

as predicted by the perceptionŒaction theory. 

However, the magnitude of such effects is 

typically relatively small, and there have been 

several failures to obtain the predicted ˚ ndings. 

Króliczak, Heard, Goodale, and Gregory (2006) 

tested the theory using the hollow-face illusion 

in which a realistic hollow mask looks like a 

normal convex face (see Figure 2.13; visit the 

website: www.richardgregory.org/experiments/

index/htm).They did this because th"

There were three stimuli: (1) a normal con- vex face mask perceived as a normal face; (2 ) a   hollow mask perceived as convex (projecting  outwards) rather than  hollow; and (3) a hollow    mask perceived as hollow.  There were also three  tasks involving a targe,Explores how memory influences cognition.,"recognition, memory, attention",Nested under Chapter on awareness,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in memory,Aligned with contemporary studies on attention,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_758,"is illusion

There were three stimuli: (1) a normal con-
vex face mask perceived as a normal face; (2 ) a 

hollow mask perceived as convex (projecting 
outwards) rather than 
hollow; and (3) a hollow  

mask perceived as hollow. 
There were also three 
tasks involving a target (small cylindrical magnet) 

placed on the face mask:
Drawing the target position on paper. This

stream and thus the vision-for-perception

and thus the vision-for-action system.

to targets on the face. Previous research 

had suggested this task might provide 

time for the vision-for-perception system 

to in˜ uence performance.

2 BASIC PROCESSES IN 
VISUAL PERCEPTION 
53
What happened?When participants drew 
the target position, there was a strong illusion 
effect (see Figure 2.14).The target was perceived 

as being much closer to the observer than was 

actually the case with the illusory hollow face. 

Indeed, the target was perceived as being almost 

as close as when presented on the normal face, 

and about 8 cm closer than the non-illusory 

hollow face.
The Þ ndings with the ß icking task were very 
different (see Figure 2.14). The ß
 icking response 
was very accurate Ð the ß
 icking response to the 
illusory hollow face treated it as a hollow face 

and very different to the normal fa"

Thus, the strong illusion of reversed depth almost   disappeared when participants made rapid   ß icking responses to the hollow mask. Finally, there are the Þ ndings with slow  point",Explores how awareness influences cognition.,"attention, memory, awareness",Nested under Chapter on attention,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in attention,Aligned with contemporary studies on memory,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_395,"ce. Here, the 
difference between the response to the illusory 

and non-illusory hollow faces was less than 1 cm. 

Thus, the strong illusion of reversed depth almost 

disappeared when participants made rapid 

ß icking responses to the hollow mask.
Finally, there are the Þ ndings with slow 
pointing (see Figure 2.14).The pointing response 

to the illusory hollow face was very different to 

that to the non-illusory hollow face, indicating 

the illusory effect was fairly strong in this condi-

tion.The most plausible interpretation of this 

Þ nding is that the vision-for-perception inß u-

enced the slow pointing response. For evidence 

supporting that conclusion, return to the text.

occasions on which the objects were grasped 

appropriately. The grasping task was performed  

on its own (control condition), while learning 

a list of paired associates, or while performing 

a spatial imagery task.
What was predicted by Creem and ProfÞ
 tt 
(2001)? If appropriate grasping requires the 

retrieval of object knowledge from long-term 

memory, then paired-associate learning (which 

involves retrieving words from long-term mem-

ory) should greatly impair peopleÕs ability to 

grasp objects appropriately. That is precisely 

what was found. Thus, retrieval of object 

knowledge (
not
 involving the dorsal stream) 

is necessary for appropriate grasping.
Milner and Goodale (2008) argued that 
most tasks in which observers grasp an object 

involve some processing in the ventral stream 

as well as in the dorsal stream. Involvement 

of the ventral, vision-for-perception system is 

especially likely in the following circumstances: 

(1) memory is required (e.g., there is a time lag 

between the offset of the stimulus and the start 

of the grasping movement); (2) time is avail-

able to plan the forthcoming movement (e.g., 

KrŠliczak et al., 2006); (3) planning which 

movement to make is necessary; or (4) the 

action is unpractised or awkward. As a rule of 

thumb, actions are most likely to involve the 

ventral stream when they are 
not
 automatic 

but involve conscious cognitive processes. It is 

assumed theoretically that the dorsal stream is 

always
 involved in carrying out actions even 

if the ventral stream has been much involved 

in prior action planning.
Milner, Dijkerman, McIntosh, Rossetti, and 
Pisella (2003) studied two patients with optic 

ataxia. As discussed earlier, this is a condition 

in which there are severe deÞ cits in reaching 

and grasping due to damage to the dorsal stream.  

These patients made reaching and grasping 

movements immediately or a few seconds after 

the offset of the t"

Surprisingly, the

this Þ
 nding? 
For example, most of your actions probably 

occur rapidly and with little or nothing in 

the way of conscious planning. In contrast, 

if you have ever eaten a Chinese meal using 

chopsticks, you probably found yourself labo-

riously working out what to do to get any 

food into your mouth. The take-home message 

is that our actions often involve the ventral, 

vision-for-perception system as well as the 

dorsal, vision-for-action system. This makes 

much sense given that the dorsal and ventral 

streams both project to the primary motor 

cortex (Rossetti & Pisella, 2002). (There is 

additional coverage of some of these issues in 

Chapter 4 in the section on GloverÕs (2004) 

planningÐ control model.)
Evidence suggesting the ventral stream 
can be involved in perception for action was 

reported by Creem and ProfÞ tt (2001). They 

argued that we should distinguish between 

effective
 and 
appropriate
 grasping. For exam-

ple, we can grasp a toothbrush effectively by its 

bristles, but appropriate grasping involves pick-

ing it up by the handle. The key assumption 

is that appropriate grasping involves accessing 

stored knowledge about the object; with the 

consequence that appropriate grasping depends 

in part on the ventral stream.
Creem and ProfÞtt tested the above 
hypothesis by asking participants to pick up 

various familiar objects with distinct handles 
Creem and Prof˚
 tt (2001) found that appropriate 
grasping of an object requires the retrieval of 
object knowledge from long-term memory.

2 BASIC PROCESSES IN 
VISUAL PERCEPTION

are two rather separate visual systems (one 
mostly concerned with perception for recogni-

tion and the other with perception for action) 

is probably broadly correct. "
Segment_98,"This assumption   has received strong support from two types of   research. First, there are studies on patients   with optic ataxia (damage to the dorsal stream)   and on visual agnosia (damage to the ventral   stream) that have produced the predicted   double dissociation. Second, there are studie",Explores how attention influences cognition.,"attention, awareness, perception",Nested under Chapter on awareness,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in awareness,Aligned with contemporary studies on attention,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_1353,"This assumption 

has received strong support from two types of 

research. First, there are studies on patients 

with optic ataxia (damage to the dorsal stream) 

and on visual agnosia (damage to the ventral 

stream) that have produced the predicted 

double dissociation. Second, there are studies 

involving several visual illusions. These studies 

have produced the surprising (but theoretically 

predicted) Þ nding that action-based perfor-

mance (e.g., grasping, pointing) is often immune  

to the illusory effects. More recently, Milner 

and Goodale (2008) have 
clariÞ
 ed the circum-
stances in which the ventral 
stream is involved 
in grasping and pointing. 
This is an important 
development of the theory because it was never 

likely that vision for action depended solely on 

the dorsal stream.
What are the limitations of the perceptionÐ
action theory? First, there is much evidence 

that the ventral stream is more likely to inß
 uence 
reaching and grasping responses when those 

responses are not immediate (Milner & Goodale, 

2008). That makes sense given that cortical 

responses to visual stimulation are typically 

much faster in dorsal areas than in ventral ones  

(Mather, 2009). The implication is that reaching 

and grasping are typically inß uenced by both 

processing streams provided that there is 

sufÞ
 cient time for the ventral stream to make 
its contribution.
Second, it is generally the case that any 
given theory is most likely to be discarded when 

someone suggests a superior theory. That has 

not happened with Milner and GoodaleÕs theory. 

However, Chen et al. (2007) have suggested 

apromising approach that can be described 

as a Òframe and Þ llÓ theory (Mather, 2009). 

According to this theory, rapid, coarse process-

ing in the dorsal stream provides the ÒframeÓ 

for slower and more precise ventral stream 

processing that supplies the ÒÞ llÓ. One of the 

advantages of this theory is that it helps to

According to Milner et al., the patients did

They did poorly when immediate responses were 

required because they could not use the ventral 

stream in that condition.
Van Doorn, van der Kamp, and Savelsbergh 
(2007) provided evidence that the ventral stream 

is involved in the planning of action. Participants 

were presented with a rod of various lengths 

yer Þ gure (see Figure 

2.10). They had to decide whether to pick the 

rod up end-to-end using a one-handed or a two-

handed grip, a decision which clearly involved 

planning. The key Þ nding was that participants 

chose a two-handed grip at shorter rod lengths 

when the Þ ns pointed outwards than when they 

pointed inwards. However, their maximal grip 

size was unaffected by the illusion. The visual 

processes guiding action selection (planning) 

seemed to involve the ventral stream whereas 

those guiding motor programming did not.
Finally, we consider Þ
 ndings difÞ cult to 
account for on the revised version of the 

perceptionÐaction theory. Coello, Danckert, 

Blangero, and Rossetti (2007) tested a patient, 

IG, with optic ataxia involving extensive 

damage to the dorsal stream. This patient 

was presented with visual illusions, and made 

perceptual judgements or actions (pointing 

or grasping). It was assumed that IG would 

rely on her intact ventral stream to perform 

both kinds of task, and so would always be 

affected by the visual illusions. In fact, how-

ever, she was 
not
 affected by the illusions when 

she used pointing or grasping actions. This is 

surprising, because showing no illusory effect 

in those conditions is supposed theoretically 

to depend on use of information from the 

dorsal stream. Coello et al. argued that IG may 

have used a visual system independent of the 

dorsal stream (and possibly running through

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
COLOUR VISION
Why has colour vision developed? After all, if 
you see an old black-and-white movie on televi-

sion, you can easily understand the moving 

images. One reason is that colour often makes 

an object stand out from its background, mak-

ing it easier to distinguish Þ
 gure from ground. 
As is well known, the ability of chameleons to 

change colour to blend in with their immediate 

environment reduces their chances of being 

attacked by predators. Another reason is that 

colour helps us to recognise and categorise 

objects. For example, colour perception is use-

ful when deciding whether a piece of fruit is 

under-ripe, ripe, or over-ripe.
Before going any further, we need to con-
sider the meaning of the word ÒcolourÓ. There 

are three main qualities associated with colour. 

First, there is 
hue
, which is what distinguishes 

red from yellow or blue. Second, there is 

brightness
, which is the perceived intensity 

of light. Third, there is 
saturation
, which 

allows us to determine whether a colour is 
vivid 
or pale. We saw earlier that the cones in the 

retina are specialised for colour vision, and we 

turn now to a more detailed consideration of 

their role.
Trichromacy theory
Cone receptors contain light-sensitive photo-

pigment allowing them to respond to light. 

According to trichromatic (three-coloured) 

theory, there are three different kinds of cone 

receptors. One type of cone receptor is most 

sensitive to short-wavelength light, and gener-

ally responds most to stimuli perceived as blue. 

A second type of cone receptor is most sensitive 

to medium-wavelength light, and responds 

greatly "
Segment_101,"to stimuli generally seen as yellow-  green. The third type of cone receptor responds   most to long-wavelength light such as that   coming from stimuli perceived as orange-red. How do we see other colours? According  to the theory, most stimuli activate two or all   three cone types. The colour we",Explores how attention influences cognition.,"emotion, recognition, awareness",Nested under Chapter on recognition,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in memory,Aligned with contemporary studies on perception,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_1310,"to stimuli generally seen as yellow-

green. The third type of cone receptor responds 

most to long-wavelength light such as that 

coming from stimuli perceived as orange-red.
How do we see other colours? According 
to the theory, most stimuli activate two or all 

three cone types. The colour we perceive is deter-

mined by the relative levels of stimulation of 
Third, the emphasis within the theory is 
on the 
separate
 contributions of the dorsal 

and ventral streams to vision and action. In 

fact, however, the two visual systems typic-

ally 
interact
 with each other. Kourtzi et al. 
(2008) discussed some of these interactions. 

For example, Kourtzi and Kanwisher (2000) 

found that photographs of an athlete running 

produced strong responses in human MT/

MST (specialised for motion processing) in 

the dorsal stream. Thus, visual perception can 

have a direct impact on pro cessing in the dorsal 

stream. Much additional research provides 

evidence that there are numerous reciprocal 

connections between the two visual streams 

(Mather, 2009).
Fourth, the notion that dorsal and ventral 
streams process very different kinds of informa-

tion is too extreme. As we saw earlier, there 

is evidence that motion-relevant information can  

reach the ventral stream without previously 

having been processed within the dorsal stream. 

Some of the complex interactions between the 

two processing streams can be inferred from 

Figure 2.5.
Fifth, it is often difÞ cult to make Þ
 rm 
predictions from the theory. This is because 

most visual tasks require the use of both 

processing streams, and there are individual 

differences in the strategies used to perform 

these tasks.
Sixth, there has been some scepticism 
(e.g., Pisella, Binkofski, Lasek, Toni, & Rossetti 

2006) as to whether clear 
double dissociations 

between optic ataxia and visual agnosia have 

been demonstrated. For example, patients with 

optic ataxia are supposed theoret ically to have

visual perception. However, some of them have 

impaired visual perception for stimuli presented

Seventh, there is much exciting research to 
be done by studying visual illusions in brain-

damaged patients. Such research has hardly 

started, but early Þndings (e.g., Coello et al., 

2007) seem somewhat inconsistent with predic-

tions of perceptionÐaction theory.

Sahay, Tait, Neitz, & Neitz, 2008). Since long-

measurement of the light absorbed at different

revealed three types of cones or receptors 

responding maximally to different wavelengths 

(see Figure 2.15). Each cone type absorbs a 

wide range of wavelengths, and so it would be 

wrong to equate one cone type directly with 

perception of blue, one with yellow-green, and 

one with orange-red. There are about 4 million

can be seen. That is precisely what Abramov and 
Gordon (1994) found when observers indicated 

the percentage of blue, green, yellow, and 

red they perceived when presented with single 

wavelengths.
Opponent-process theory explains nega-
tive afterimages. Prolonged viewing of a given 

colour (e.g., red) produces one extreme of 

activity in the relevant opponent process. When 

attention is then directed to a white surface, 

the opponent process moves to its other extreme, 

thus producing the negative afterimage.
The theory is of relevance in explaining 
some types of colour deÞ
 ciency. Red-green 
deÞ
 ciency (the most common form of colour 
blindness) occurs when the high- or medium-

wavelength cones are damaged or missing, and

Blue-

yellow deÞ ciency occurs when individuals lack-

ing the short-wavelength cones cannot make 

effective use of the blueÐyellow channel.
Dual-process theory
The trichromacy and opponent-process theories  

are both partially correct. Hurvich and Jameson 

(1957) developed a dual-process theory that 

provided a synthesis of the two earlier theories. 

According to their theory, signals from the three 

cone types identiÞ ed by trichromacy theory are  

sent to the opponent cells described in the 

opponent-process theory (see Figure 2.16). There 

are three channels. The achromatic (non-colour) 

channel combines the activity of the medium- and 

long-wavelength cones. The blueÐyellow channel 

represents the dif ference between the sum of the 

medium- and long-wavelength cones, on the one  

hand, and the short-wavelength cones, on the 

other. The direction of difference determines 
Why has evolution equipped us with three 
types of cone? It is clearly a very efÞ
 cient system 
Ðwe can discriminate literally millions of colours

even with such a limited number of cone types.
Opponent-process theory
Trichromatic theory provides a reasonable 

account of what happens at the receptor level. 

However, it does not explain what happens 

after
 the cone receptors have been activated. 

In addition, it cannot account for 
negative 

afterimages
. If you stare at a square of a given 

colour for several seconds and then shift your 

gaze to a white surface, you will see a nega-

tive afterimage in the complementary colour 

(complementary colours produce white when 

combined). For example, a green square pro-

duces a red afterimage, whereas a blue square 

produces a yellow afterimage.
The mysteries of negative afterimages were 
solved by Ewald Hering (1878) with his 

opponent-process theory. He assumed there 

are three types of opponent processes in the 

visual system. One opponent process (redÐ

green channel) produces per"

of opponent process (blueÐyellow channel) pro-

channel) produces the percep

one extreme and of black at the other.
There is convincing evidence support-
ing opponent-process theory. DeValois and 

DeValois (1975) discovered opponent cells in 

the geniculate nucleus of monkeys. These cells 

showed increased activity to some wavelengths 

of light but decreased activity to others. For 

red-green cells, the transition point between 

increased and decreased activity occurred between 

the green and red parts of the spectrum. In 

contrast, blue-yellow cells had a transition 

point between the yellow and blue parts of the 

spectrum.

colour when there is a change in the wave-
lengths contained in the illuminant (the light 

illuminating the surface or object). The phe-

nomenon of colour constancy indicates that 

colour vision does not depend solely on the 

wavelengths of the light reß
 ected from objects. 
What is the importance of colour constancy? 

We can answer that question by considering 

what would happen if we lacked colour con-

stancy. The apparent colour of familiar objects 

would change dramatically as a function of 

changes in the lighting conditions, and this 

would make it very difÞ cult to recognise obj"

Observers were initially presented with six 

uniformly coloured papers that were similar 

in colour and learned to name them. After that, 

the observers tried to identify individual papers  

presented at various indoor and outdoor 
whether blue or yellow is seen. Finally, the redÐ

green channel represents the difference between 

activity levels in the medium- and long-wavelength 

cones. The direction of this dif ference deter-

mines whether red or green is perceived.
Evaluation
As we have seen, there is plentiful support for 

the dual-process theory. However, it is becom-

ing increasingly clear that it is oversimpliÞ
 ed 
(see Solomon & Lennie, 2007, for a review). 

For example, Solomon and Lennie identify two 

Þ
 ndings that are puzzling from the perspective 
of dual-process theory. First, the proportions 

of different cone types vary considerably across 

individuals, but this has very little effect on colour 

perception. Second, the arrangement of cone 

types in the eye is fairly 
random 
(e.g., Roorda 
& Williams, 1999). This seems odd because it 

presumably makes it difÞ cult for colour-opponent 

mechanisms to work effectively. What such 

Þ
 ndings suggest is that the early processes involved 
in colour vision are much more complicated 

than was previously believed to be the case. 

Solomon and Lennie discuss some of these 

complications in their review article.

conditions could be predicted on the basis of 
cone-excitation ratios.
Reeves, Amano, and Foster (2008) argued 
that it is important to distinguish between 

our subjective experience and our judgements 

about the world. We can see the difference 

clearly if we consider feelings of warmth. As 

you walk towards a Þ re, it feels subjectively to 

get progressively hotter, but how hot the Þ
 re 
is judged to be is unlikely to change. Reeves 

et al. found high levels of colour constancy 

when observers made judgements about the 

objective
 similarity of two stimuli seen under 

different illuminants. Observers were also very 

good at deciding whether differences between 

two stimuli resulted from a change in material 

or a change in illumination. However, low 

levels of colour constancy were obtained when 

observers rated the
 subjective
 similarity of the 

hue and saturation of two stimuli. Colour con-

stancy was high when observers took account 

of the context to distinguish between the effects 

of material change and illumination change,

you observe a piece of paper in 
isolation
, you 

cannot tell the extent to which the wavelengths

Many factors are involved in allowing us to 

show reasonable colour constancy most of 

the time in spite of this problem. However, 

what is of central importance is 
context
 Ð 

according to LandÕs (1977, 1986) retinex 

theory, we decide the colour of a surface by 

comparing its ability to reß ect short, medium, 

and long wavelengths against that of adjacent 

surfaces. Land argued that colour constancy 

breaks down when such comparisons cannot 

be made effectively.
Foster and Nascimento (1994) developed 
some of LandÕs ideas into an inß
 uential theory 
based on cone-excitation ratios. They worked 

out cone excitations from various surfaces 

viewed under different conditions of illumina-

tion. We can see what their big discovery was 

by considering a simple example. Suppose there 

were two illuminants and two surfaces. If sur-

face 1 led to the long-wavelength or red cones 

responding 
three
 times as much with illuminant 
1 as illuminant 2, then the same 
threefold
 

difference was also found with surface 2. Thus, 

the ratio of cone responses was essentially 

invariant with different illuminants, and thus 

displayed reasonably high constancy. As a result, 

we can use information about cone-excitation 

ratios to eliminate the effects of the illuminant 

and so assess object colour accurately.
There is considerable support for the notion 
that cone-excitation ratios are important.

2 BASIC PROCESSES IN 
VISUAL PERCEPTION 
61
Top-down inß uences (e.g., knowledge, 
familiar colour) can have a strong effect on 
colour constancy. Suppose that light from a 

strongly coloured surface reß ects onto a nearby 

white surface. We all know that will affect the 

light reß ected from the white surface, and take 

that into account when judging the colour of 

the white surface. Bloj, Kersten, and Hurlbert 

(1999) set up a visual display in which observ-

ers judged the colour of a white surface. In one 

condition, observers were presented with a 

three-dimensional display that created the 
false
 
impression that a strongly coloured surface 

reß
 ected onto that white surface. This misled 
the observers and produced a substantial reduc-

tion in colour constancy.
Colour constancy is inß uenced by our know-
ledge of the familiar colours of objects (e.g., 

bananas are yellow; tomatoes are red). This was 

shown in a study by Hansen, Olkkonen, Walter, 

and Gegenfurtner (2006). Observers viewed 

digitised photographs of fruits and adjusted 

their colour until they appeared grey. The key 

Þ
 nding was a general over-adjustment. For 
example, a banana still looked yellowish to the 

observers when it was actually grey, causing 

them to adjust its colour to a slightly bluish

typical colour.

Other factors
One of the reasons we show colour constancy 

is because of 
chromatic adaptation
, in which 

sensitivity to light of any given colour or hue 

decreases over time. If you stand outside after 

dark, you may be struck by the yellowness of 

the artiÞ cial light in peopleÕs houses. However, 

if you have been in a room illuminated by 

artiÞ
 cial light for some time, the light does not 
seem yellow. Thus, chromatic adaptation can 

enhance colour constancy. Uchikawa, Uchikawa, 

and Boynton (1989) carried out a study in which 

observers looked at isolated patches of coloured 

paper. When the observer and the paper were 

both illuminated by red light, there was chro-

matic adaptation Ð the perceived colour of the 

paper only shifted slightly towards red. The 

Þ
 ndings were different when the observer was 
illuminated by white light and the paper by red 

light. In this condition, there was little chromatic 

adaptation, and the perceived colour of the 

paper shifted considerably towards red.
Kraft and Brainard (1999) set up a visual 
environment in a box. It included a tube 

wrapped in tin foil, a pyramid, a cube, and a 

Mondrian stimulus (square shapes of different 

colours). When all the objects were visible, colour 

constancy was as high as 83% even with large 

changes in illumination. However, it decreased 

when the various cues were progressively elimi-

nated. The most important factor in colour 

constancy was 
local contrast
, which involves 

comparing the retinal cone responses from the 

target surface with those from the immediate 

background (cone-excitation rat"
Segment_111,"ios). When local   contrast could not be used, colour constancy   dropped from 83 to 53%. Another important   factor was  global   contrast , in which retinal  cone responses from the target surface are com-  pared with the average cone responses across   the entire visual scene.

When local 

contrast could not be used, colour constancy 

dropped from 83 to 53%. Another important 

factor was
 global
 
contrast
, in which retinal 
cone responses from the target surface are com-

pared with the average cone responses across 

the entire visual scene. When the observers could 

not use global contrast, colour constancy dropped 

from 53 to 39%. When all the non-target 

objects were removed, the observers were 

denied valuable information in the form of 

reß
 ected highlights from glossy surfaces (e.g., 
tube wrapped in tin foil). This caused colour 

constancy to drop to 11%.
chromatic adaptation:
 reduced sensitivity 
to light of a given colour or hue after lengthy 

exposure.

sive theory of how the various factors combine 
to produce colour constancy. Second, there is 

much to be discovered about the brain mech-

anisms involved in colour perception and colour 

constancy. For example, we do not have a clear 

understanding of why the cone types in the 

eye are distributed fairly randomly rather than 

systematically. Third, there is evidence (e.g., 

Reeves et al., 2008) indicating that the extent to  

which we show colour constancy depends greatly 

on the precise instructions used. Little is known 

of the factors producing these large differences.
PERCEPTION WITHOUT 
AWARENESS
It is tempting to assume that visual perception 
is a conscious process. However, that is not 

always the case. For example, there are patients 

with severe damage to VI (primary visual cor-

tex) who suffer from 
blindsight
. Such patients 

can respond appropriately to visual stimuli in 

the absence of conscious visual experience.

Blindsight
Numerous British soldiers in the First World 

War who had received head wounds were treated 

by an Army doctor called George Riddoch. He 

found something fascinating in many of those 
to respond to a given colour even though there 

were large changes in the background colour. 

Thus, cells in V4 (but not earlier in visual 

processing) exhibit colour constancy.
Barbur and Spang (2008) studied instan-
taneous colour constancy, in which there is 

high colour constancy following a sudden change 

in illuminant. Use of fMRI revealed, as expected, 

that the computations involved in instantaneous 

colour constancy involved V4. Less expectedly, 

V1 (primary visual cortex) was equally involved,  

and there was also signiÞ cant activation in V2 

and V3. These Þ ndings suggest that areas other 

than V4 play an important role in colour 

constancy.
There is a Þ nal point. We should not regard 
colour processing as being entirely separate from 

other kinds of object processing. For example, 

colour can inß uence perceived shape. Imagine 

looking at a garden fairly late on a sunny day 

with strong shadows cast by the trees. It is 

easier to work out object boundaries (e.g., of 

the lawn) by using differences in colour or 

chromaticity than in luminance. Kingdom (2003) 

found that gratings that look almost ß
 at can 
be made to look corrugated in depth by the 

addition of appropriate colour.
Evaluation
Colour constancy is a complex achievement, 

and observers often fall well short of complete 

constancy. In view of its complexity, it is unsur-

prising that the visual system adopts an Òall 

hands on deckÓ approach in which many fac-

tors make a contribution. The most important 

factors are those relating to the visual environ-

ment, especially context (local contrast, global 

contrast). Of special importance are cone-

excitation ratios that remain almost invariant

 eld. This is the most studied sub-type.
Attention-blindsight
(2) 
: these patients can 
detect objects and motion and have a 

vague conscious feeling of objects in spite 

of reporting that they cannot see them. 

They can make some use of the dorsal 

stream and the motion area (MT). Danckert 

et al. (2003) found that an intact posterior
 
parietal cortex in the dorsal stream was 

essential for showing action-blindsight.

Agnosopsia
(3) 
: these patients deny any 
conscious awareness of visual stimuli. 

However
, they exhibit some ability to 
discriminate form and wavelength and to 

use the ventral stream.
The phenomenon of blindsight becomes 
somewhat less paradoxical if we consider how 

it is assessed in more detail. There are generally 
two measures. First, there are patientsÕ subjec-

tive reports that they cannot see some stimulus 

presented to their blind region. Second, there 

is a forced-choice test in which patients guess 

(e.g., stimulus present or absent?) or p"

Note that the two   measures are very different from each other.   Note also that we could try to account for   blin,Explores how awareness influences cognition.,"emotion, memory, attention",Nested under Chapter on emotion,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in awareness,Aligned with contemporary studies on memory,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_1200,"oint at the
 
stimulus they cannot see. Blindsight is deÞ
 ned 
by an absence of self-reported visual perception 

accompanied by above-chance performance 

on the forced-choice test. Note that the two 

measures are very different from each other. 

Note also that we could try to account for 

blindsight by assuming that subjective reports 

provide a less sensitive measure of visual 

perception than does a forced-choice test. This 

is an issue to which we will return.
There is one Þ nal point. As Cowey (2004, 
p.588) pointed out, ÒThe impression is some-

times given, however unwittingly, that blind-

sight  .  .  .  (is) like normal vision stripped of 

conscious visual experience. Nothing could 

be further from the truth, for blindsight is 

characterised by severely impoverished dis-

crimination of visual stimuli.Ó
Evidence
The most thoroughly studied blindsight patient 

is DB. He underwent surgical removal of the 
with injuries to the primary visual cortex (BA 

17)at the back of the occipital area of the

brain (see Figure 1.3). This area is involved in 

the early stages of visual processing, so it was 

unsurprising that these patients had a loss of 

perception in parts of the visual Þ
 eld. Much 
more surprising was that they responded to 

motion in those parts of the visual Þ eld in which 

they claimed to be blind (Riddoch, 1917)! Such 

patients are said to suffer from blindsight, which 

neatly captures the apparently paradoxical nature 

of their condition.
Blindsight patients typically have extensive 
damage to V1. However, their loss of visual 

awareness in the blind Þ
 eld is probably
 not
 due 
directly to the V1 damage. Damage to V1 has 

knock-on effects throughout the visual system, 

leading to greatly reduced activation of sub-

s e quent visual processing areas (Silvanto, 2008).
There are at least ten pathways from the 
eye to the brain, many of which can be used 

by blindsight patients (Cowey, 2004). It appears 

that cortical mech"
Segment_115,"anisms are not essential.

Kıhler and Moscovitch (1997) found that 

blindsight patients who had had an entire corti-

cal hemisphere removed nevertheless showed 

evidence of blindsight for stimulus detection, 

stimulus localisation, form discrimination, and 

motion detection for stimuli presented to their 

removed hemisphere. However, those having 

a cortical visual system (apart from primary 

visual cortex) can perform more perceptual 

tasks than those lacking a cerebral hemisphere 

(Stoerig & Cowey, 1997). There is evidence 

that blindsight patients can often make use of 

a tract linking the lateral geniculate nucleus to 

the ipsilateral (same side of the body) human 

visual motion area V5/MT that bypasses V1.

at chance level when trying to detect a light 
presented to the blind area of the visual Þ
 eld. 
However, the time they took to direct their eyes 

at a light presented to the 
intact
 part of the visual 
Þ
 eld increased when a light was presented to the 
blind area at the same time. Thus, blindsight 

patients processed the light in the blind area even 

though they showed no evidence of detecting it  

when deciding whether it was present or absent.
One of the central issues is whether blind-
sight patients genuinely lack conscious visual 

perception. Some blindsight patients may have 

residual vision, claiming that they are aware 

that 
something
 is happening even though they 
cannot see anything. Weiskrantz ("
Segment_116,"e.g., 2004)   used the term blindsight Type 1 (similar to   Danckert and RossettiÕs, 2005, agnosopsia) to   describe patients with no conscious awareness.   He used the term blindsight Type 2 (similar to   attention-blindsight) to describe those with   awareness that something was happening. An   ex",Explores how attention influences cognition.,"perception, memory, emotion",Nested under Chapter on memory,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in emotion,Aligned with contemporary studies on recognition,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_232,"e.g., 2004) 

used the term blindsight Type 1 (similar to 

Danckert and RossettiÕs, 2005, agnosopsia) to 

describe patients with no conscious awareness. 

He used the term blindsight Type 2 (similar to 

attention-blindsight) to describe those with 

awareness that something was happening. An 

example of Type 2 blindsight was found in 

patient EY, who Òsensed a deÞ
 nite pinpoint of 
lightÓ, although Òit does not actually look like 

a light. It looks like nothing at allÓ (Weiskrantz, 

1980). Type 2 blindsight sounds suspiciously 

like residual conscious vision. However, patients 

who have been tested many times may start to 

rely on indirect evidence (Cowey, 2004). For 

example, the performance of patients with some  

ability to guess whether a stimulus is moving 

to the left or the right may depend on some 

vague awareness of their own eye movements.
Evidence that blindsight can be very unlike 
normal conscious vision was reported by 

Persaud and Cowey (2008). The blindsight 

patient GY was presented with a stimulus in 

the upper or lower part of his visual Þ
 eld. On 
some trials (inclusion trials), he was instructed 

to report the part of the visual Þ eld to which 

the stimulus had been presented. On other 
right occipital cortex including most of the 

primary visual cortex. He showed some per-

ceptual skills, including an ability to detect 

whether a visual stimulus had been presented 

to the blind area and to identify its location. 

However, he reported no conscious experience 

in his blind Þ eld. According to Weiskrantz, 

Warrington, Sanders, and Marshall (1974, 

p. 721), ÒWhen he was shown a video Þ
 lm of 
his reaching and judging orientation of lines 

(by presenting it to his intact visual Þ
 eld), he 
was openly astonished.Ó

his considerable surprise that DB showed this 

negative after-effect. This is surprising, because 

there was conscious perception of the after-

image but not of the stimulus responsible for 

producing the afterimage! DB showed other 

afterimages found in healthy individuals. For 

example, he reported an apparent increase in 

the size of visual afterimages when viewed 

against a nearby surface and then against a 

surface further away (
EmmertÕs law
). Thus, 

DBÕs perceptual processing is more varied and 

thorough than previously believed.
Impressive Þndings were reported by de 
Gelder, Vroeman, and Pourtois (2001), who 

discovered GY could discriminate whether an 

unseen face had a happy or a fearful expres-

sion. He was probably responding to some 

distinctive facial feature (e.g., fearful faces have 

wide-open eyes), since it is improbable that he 

processed the subtleties of facial expression. 

The ability of blindsight patients to distinguish 

among emotional expressions in the absence 

of visual awareness is known as affective blind-

sight (see Chapter 15).
It would be useful to study the perceptual 
abilities of blindsight patients 
without
 relying on  

their subjective (and possibly inaccurate) reports 

of what they can see in the blind Þ
 eld. This 
was done by Rafal, Smith, Krantz, Cohen, and 

Brennan (1990). Blindsight patients performed 
EmmertÕs law:
 the size of an afterimage 
appears larger when viewed against a far surface 

than when viewed against a near one.

Evaluation
There are various reasons for accepting blind-

sight as a genuine phenomenon. First, there are 

studies indicating blindsight in which potential 

problems with the use of subjec tive (and possibly 

distorted) verbal reports have apparently been 

overcome (e.g., Persaud & Cowey, 2008). Second, 

there are studies in which evidence for blind-

sight did not depend on subjective verbal reports 

(e.g., Rafal et al., 1990). Third, there are func-

tional neuroimaging studies showing that many 

blindsight patients have activation predom-

inantly or exclusively in the dorsal stream (see 

Danckert & Rossetti, 2005, for a review). This 

is important evidence because conscious visual 

perception is primarily associated with activa-

tion in the ventral stream (Norman, 2002).
What are the problems with research on 
blindsight? First, there are considerable dif-

ferences among blindsight patients, which led 

Danckert and Rossetti (2005) to identify three 

subtypes. As a result, it is hard to draw any 

general conclusions.
Second, there is evidence (e.g., Danckert 
& Rossetti, 2005; Overgaard, Fehl, Mouridsen, 

Bergholt, & Cleermans, 2008; Weiskrantz, 2004) 

that a few blindsight patients possess some 

conscious visual awareness in 
their allegedly 
trials (exclusion trials), GY was told to report 

the opposite of its actual location (e.g., ÒUpÓ 

when it was in the lower part). GY tended to 

respond with the
 real
 rather than the 
opposite
 
location on exclusion trials as well as inclusion 

trials when the stimulus was presented to his 

blind Þ eld. This suggests that he had access to 

location information but lacked any conscious 

awareness of that information. In contrast, GY  

showed a large difference in performance on 

inclusion and exclusion trials when the stimu-

lus was presented to his normal or intact Þ
 eld, 
indicating he had conscious access to"
Segment_119,location   information. Persaud and Cowey used the   Þ  ndings from inclusion and exclusion trials to  conclude that conscious processes were involved   when stimuli were presented to GYÕs normal   Þ  eld but not to his blind Þ eld (see Figure 2.17). Overgaard et al. (2008) pointed out that  resear,Explores how awareness influences cognition.,"emotion, perception, attention",Nested under Chapter on perception,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in awareness,Aligned with contemporary studies on attention,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_1059," location

Þ
 ndings from inclusion and exclusion trials to 
conclude that conscious processes were involved 

when stimuli were presented to GYÕs normal 

Þ
 eld but not to his blind Þ eld (see Figure 2.17).
Overgaard et al. (2008) pointed out that 
researchers often ask blindsight patients to 

indicate on a yes/no basis whether they have 

seen a given stimulus. That opens up the pos-

sibility that blindsight patients have some con-

scious vision but simply set a high threshold 

for reporting awareness. Overgaard et al. used 

a four-point scale of perceptual awareness: 

Òclear imageÓ, Òalmost clear imageÓ, Òweak 

glimpseÓ, and Ònot seenÓ. Their blindsight 

patient, GR, was given a visual discrimination 

task (deciding whether a triangle, circle, or 

square had been presented). There was a strong 

association between the level of perceptual 

awareness and the accuracy of her performance 

when stimuli were presented to her blind Þ
 eld.

had a clear image, 72% of the time when her

This caused an increase of 18% in the cinema sales

sales. Alas, Vicary admitted in 1962 that the 

study was a fabrication. In addition, Trappery 

(1996) reported in a meta-analysis that stimuli 

presented below the conscious threshold had 

practically no effect on consumer behaviour.
In spite of early negative Þ
 ndings, many 
researchers h"
Segment_120,"ave carried out studies to demon-  strate the existence of unconscious perception.   There are three main ways in which they pres-  ent visual stimuli below the level of conscious   awareness. First, the stimuli can be very weak   or faint. Second, the stimuli can be presented   very brieß y. Third,",Explores how emotion influences cognition.,"memory, recognition, perception",Nested under Chapter on emotion,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in memory,Aligned with contemporary studies on memory,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_297,"ave carried out studies to demon-

There are three main ways in which they pres-

ent visual stimuli below the level of conscious 

awareness. First, the stimuli can be very weak 

or faint. Second, the stimuli can be presented 

very brieß y. Third, the target stimulus can be 

immediately followed by a masking stimulus 

(one that serves to inhibit processing of the 

target stimulus).
How can we decide whether an observer has 
consciously perceived certain visual stimuli? 

According to Merikle, Smilek, and Eastwood 

(2001), there are two main thresholds or 

criteria:
Subjective threshold
(1) 
: this is deÞ ned by an 
individualÕ
s failure to report conscious 
awareness of a stimulus.

Objective threshold
(2) 
: this is deÞ
 ned by an 
individualÕs inability to make accurate 
forced-choice decisions about a stimulus 

(e.g., guess at above-chance level whether 

it is a word or not).
T
wo issues arise with these threshold measures. 
First, as Reingold (2004, p. 882) pointed out, ÒA 

valid measure must index 
all 
of the perceptual 
information available for consciousness  .  .  .  and 
blind field. It is doubtful 
whe 
ther such 
patients fulÞ l all the criteria for blindsight.
Third, consider one of the most-studied 
blindsight patients, GY, whose left V1 was 

destroyed. He has a tract connecting the 

undamaged right lateral geniculate nucleus to 

the 
contralateral
 (opposite side of the body) 
visual motion area V5/MT (Bridge, Thomas, 

Jbabdi, & Cowey, 2008) (see Figure 2.18). This 

tract is 
not
 present in healthy individuals. 

The implication is that some visual processes 

in blindsight patients may be speciÞ c to them 

and so we cannot generalise from such patients 

to healthy individuals.
Fourth, Campion, Latto, and Smith (1983) 
argued that stray light may fall into the intact 

visual Þ eld of blindsight patients. As a result, 

their ability to show above-chance performance

James Vicary reported powerful evidence for 

unconscious perception. He claimed to have

only
 conscious, but not unconscious informa-
tion.Ó That is a tall order. Second, it is hard 

to show that either measure indicates zero 

conscious awareness given the difÞ
 culty (or 
impossibility) of proving the null hypothesis.
In practice, observers often show Òaware-
nessÓ of a stimulus assessed by the objective 

threshold even when the stimulus does not 

exceed the subjective threshold. The objective 

threshold may seem unduly stringent. How 
ever, 
many psychologists argue that it is more valid 

than a reliance on peopleÕs possibly inaccurate or  

biased reports of their conscious experience.
Evidence
Naccache, Blandin, and Dehaene (2002) carried 

out various experiments in which participants 

decided rapidly whether a clearly visible target 

di"
Segment_122,"git was smaller or larger than 5. Unknown   to them, an invisible, masked digit was resented   for 29 ms immediately before the target.

In  one experiment (Experiment 2), a cue signalling   the i",Explores how perception influences cognition.,"perception, attention, emotion",Nested under Chapter on emotion,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in perception,Aligned with contemporary studies on attention,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_309,"git was smaller or larger than 5. Unknown 

to them, an invisible, masked digit was resented 

for 29 ms immediately before the target. The 

masked digit was congruent with the target (both 

digits on the same side of 5) or incon 
gruent. In 
one experiment (Experiment 2), a cue signalling 

the imminent presentation of the target digit 

was either present or absent.
Naccache et al. (2002) reported three 
main Þ ndings. First, there was no evidence of 

conscious perception of the masked digits: 

no participants reported seeing any of them 

(subjective measure) and their performance 

when guessing whether the masked digit was 

below or above 5 was at chance level (objective 

measure). Second, performance with the target 

digits was faster on congruent than on incon-

gruent trials when cueing was present, indicat-

ing that some unconscious perceptual processing 

of the masked digits had occurred. Third, this 

congruency effect disappeared when there was 

no cueing, indicating that attention was neces-

sary for unconscious perception to occur.
It is generally assumed that information 
perceived with awareness can be used to con-

trol our actions, whereas information perceived 

without awareness cannot. If so, there should 

be situations in which perceiving with or 

without awareness has very different effects on 

behaviour. Supporting evidence was reported 
by Persaud and McLeod (2008). They presented  

the letter ÒbÓ or ÒhÓ for 10 ms (short interval) 

or 15 ms (long interval). In the key condition, 

participants were instructed to respond with 

the letter that had
 not
 been presented. The 

rationale for doing this was that participants 

who were consciously aware of the letter would 

be able to inhibit saying the letter actually 

presented. In contrast, those who were not 

consciously aware of it would be unable to 

inhibit saying the presented letter.
What did Persaud and McLeod (2008) 
Þ
 nd? With the longer presentation interval,

Segment_123,"rticipants responded correctly with the non-  presented letter on 83% of trials. This suggests   that there was some conscious awareness of   the stimulus in that condition.

presented letter on 83% of trials. This suggests 

that there was some conscious awareness of 

the stimulus in that condition. With the shorter 

presentation interval, participants responded 

correctly on only 43% of trials, which was sig-

niÞ
 cantly below chance. This Þ
 nding indicates 
there was some processing of the stimulus. 

However, the below-chance performance strongly 

suggests that participants lacked conscious 

awareness of that processing.
The above conclusion was supported in a 
further similar experiment by Persaud and 

McLeod (2008). The main difference was that 

participants had to decide whether to wager 

£1 or £2 on the correctness of each of their 

responses. With the shorter presentation inter-

val, participants wagered the smaller amount 

on 90% of trials on which their response was 

correct (i.e., saying the letter not presented). 

Presumably they would have wagered the 

larger amount if they had had conscious aware-

ness of the stimulus that had been presented.
Dehaene et al. (2001) used fMRI and 
event-related potentials (ERPs; see Glossary) 

to identify brain areas active during the pro-

cessing of masked words that were not con-

sciously perceived and unmasked words that 

were consciously perceived. In one condition, 

a masked word was followed by an unmasked 

presentation of the same word. There were two 

main Þ
 ndings. First, there was detectable brain 
activity when masked words were presented. 

However, it was much less than when unmasked 

words were presented, especially in prefrontal

sufÞ
 cient perceptual processing to inß
 uence at 
least some aspects of behaviour without con-

scious perceptual experience. Other theoretical 

ideas have emerged in the cognitive neuroscience 

area (see Chapter 16).
DEPTH AND SIZE 
PERCEPTION
A major accomplishment of visual perception 
is the transformation of the two-dimensional 

retinal image into perception of a three-

dimensional world seen in depth. There are 

more than a dozen cues to visual depth, with 

a cue being deÞ ned as Òany sensory informa-

tion that gives rise to a sensory estimateÓ (Ernst 


ambiguous information (Jacobs, 2002). In 

addition, different cues often provide con-

ß
 icting information. For example, when you 
watch a Þ
 lm at the cinema or on television, 
some cues (e.g., stereo ones) indicate that 

everything you see is at the same distance from 

you, whereas other cues (e.g., perspective, 

shading) indicate that some objects are closer 

to you than others.
In real life, cues to depth are often provided 
by movement of the observer or objects in the 

visual environment. Some of the cues we use 

are not visual (e.g., based on touch or on hear-

ing). However, the major focus here will be on 

visual depth cues available even if the observer 

and environmental objects are static. These cues 

can conveniently be divided into monocular, 

binocular, and oculomotor cues. 
Monocular 
and parietal areas. Second, the amount of 

brain activity produced by presentation of an 

unmasked word was reduced when preceded 

by the same word presented masked. This 

repetition suppression effect suggests that some 

of the processing typically found when a word 

is "
Segment_125,presented occurs even when it is presented   below the conscious threshold. Findings consistent with those of Dehaene  et al. (2001) were reported by Melloni et al.   (2007; see Chapter 16).

Findings consistent with those of Dehaene 
et al. (2001) were reported by Melloni et al. 

(2007; see Chapter 16). They used EEG (see 

Glossary) to 
compare brain activity associated 

with the 
processing of consciously perceived 

words and 
those not consciously perceived. Only 

theformerwere associated with synchronised 

neural 
activity involving several brain areas 
including prefrontal cortex. However, and most 

importantly in the present context, even words 

not 
consciously perceived were associated with 
sufÞ
 cient EEG activation to produce reasonably 
thorough processing. Additional research on 

brain activation associated with subliminal 

perception is discussed in Chapter 16.
Snodgrass, Bernat, and Shevrin (2004) 
carried out meta-analyses involving nine stud-

ies on unconscious perception. In their Þ
 rst 
meta-analysis, there was no signiÞ
 cant evidence 
of above-chance performance on measures of 

conscious perception. However, in their second 

meta-analysis, there was very highly signi-

Þ
 cant evidence of above-chance performance 
on objective measures designed to assess uncon-

scious perception.
Evaluation
The entire notion of unconscious or subliminal 

perception used to be regarded as very con-

troversial. However, there is now reasonable 

evidence for its existence. Some of the evidence 

is behavioural (e.g., Naccache et al., 2002; 

Persaud & McLeod, 2008). Recently, there has 

been a substantial increase in functional neuro-

imaging evidence (e.g., Dehaene et al., 2001; 

see Chapter 16). This evidence indicates that 

there can be substantial processing of visual 

stimuli up to and including the semantic level  

in the absence of conscious visual awareness.

A further cue is 
interposition
, in which 
a nearer object hides part of a more distant 

one from view. The strength of this cue can 

be seen in KanizsaÕs (1976) illusory square (see 

Figure 2.20). There is a strong impression of 

a yellow square in front of four purple circles 

even though many of the contours of the yellow 

square are missing.
Shading

to depth. Flat, two-dimensional surfaces do not 

cast shadows, and so the presence of shading 

indicates the presence of a three-dimensional 
cues
 are those requiring only the use of one 

eye, although they can be used readily when 

someone has both eyes open. Such cues clearly 

exist, because the world still retains a sense of 

depth with one eye closed. 
Binocular cues
 are 

those involving both eyes being used together. 

Finally, 
oculomotor cues
 are kinaesthetic, 
depending on sensations of muscular contrac-

tion of the muscles around the eye.
Monocular cues
Monocular cues to depth are sometimes 

called 
pictorial cues
, because they are used by 
artists trying to create the impression of three-

dimensional scenes while painting on two-

dimensional canvases. One such cue is 
linear 

perspective
. Parallel lines pointing directly away 

from us seem progressively closer together as 

they recede into the distance (e.g., the edges 

of a motorway). This convergence of lines 

creates a powerful impression of depth in a 

two-dimensional drawing.
Another cue related to perspective is aerial 
perspective. Light is scattered as it travels 

through the atmosphere (especially if it is 

dusty), making more distant objects lose con-

trast and seem hazy. OÕShea, Blackburn, and 

Ono (1994) mimicked the effects of aerial per-

spective by reducing the contrast of features 

within a picture. This led those features to 

appear more distant.

change) of texture density as you look from 

the front to the back of a slanting object. If 

you were unwise enough to stand between the 

rails of a railway track and look along it, the 

details would become less clear as you looked 

into the distance. In addition, the distance 

between the connections would appear to 

reduce. Sinai, Ooi, and He (1998) found that 

observers were good at judging the distance of 

objects within seven metres of them when the 

ground in-between was uniformly textured.

The pictorial cues we have discussed could

also depends on oculumotor cues based on 

perceiving contractions of the muscles around 

the eyes. One such cue is 
convergence
, which 

refers to the fact that the eyes turn inwards 

more to focus on a very close object than 

one farther away. Another oculomotor cue is 

accommodation
. It refers to the variation in 

optical power produced by a thickening of 

the lens of the eye when focusing on a close 

object. Each of these cues only produces a 

single value in any situation. That means it can 

only provide information about the distance of 

one object at a time.
object. Ramachandran (1988) presented observers 

with a visual display consisting of numerous 

very similar shaded circular patches, some 

illuminated by one light source and the remainder 

illuminated by a different light source. The 

observers incorrectly assumed that the visual 

display was lit by a single light source above 

the display. This led them to assign 
different 

depths to different parts of the dis 
play (i.e., 
some ÒdentsÓ were misperceived as bumps).
Another useful monocular cue is 
familiar 
size
. If we know the actual size of an object, 

we can use its retinal image size to provide an 

accurate estimate of its distance. However, we 

can be misled if an object is 
not
 in its familiar 

size. Ittelson (1951) had observers look at play-

ing cards through a peephole restricting them 

to monocular vision and largely eliminated 

depth cues other than familiar size. There were 

three playing cards (normal size, half size, 

and double size) presented one at a time at a

However, contrary evidence was reported by 
 

recognition of familiar objects was 
not
 adversely 
affected when stereoscopic information was 

scrambled and thus incongruous. Indeed, the 

observers seemed unaware the depth informa-

tion was scrambled! What seemed to happen was 

that observersÕ expectations about the structure 

of familiar objects were more important than 

the misleading stereoscopic information.
A key process in stereopsis is to match 
features in the input presented to the two eyes. 

Sometimes we make mistakes in doing this, 

which can lead to various visual illusions. For 

example, suppose you spend some time staring 

at wallpaper having a regular pattern. You may

Depth perception also depends on binocu-
lar cues that are only available when both eyes  

are used.
 Stereopsis
  involves binocular cues. 

It is based on 
binocular disparity
, which is the 

difference or disparity in the images projected 

on the retinas of the two eyes when you view 

a scene. Convergence, accommodation, and 

stereopsis are only effective in facilitating depth 

perception over relatively short distances. The 

usefulness of convergence as a cue to dist"

However, it is clearly of no   use at distances greater than a few metres, and   negative Þ  ndings have been reported when real  objects are used (Wade & Swanston, 2001).   Accommodation is also of limited use. Its   potential value as a depth cue is limited to the   regio",Explores how recognition influences cognition.,"emotion, attention, awareness",Nested under Chapter on awareness,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in attention,Aligned with contemporary studies on perception,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_886,"ance

use at distances greater than a few metres, and 

negative Þ
 ndings have been reported when real 
objects are used (Wade & Swanston, 2001). 

Accommodation is also of limited use. Its 

potential value as a depth cue is limited to the 

region of space immediately in front of you. 

However, distance judgements based on accom-

modation are fairly inaccurate even with nearby 

ith respect to 

stereopsis, the disparity or discrepancy in the 

retinal images of an object decreases by a factor 

of 100 as its distance increases from 2 to 20 

metres (Bruce et al., 2003). Thus, stereopsis rapidly  

becomes less effective at greater distances.
It has sometimes been assumed that stereo-
scopic information is available early in visual 

perception and is of use in object recognition. 
If you look into the 
distance through the 

windows of a moving 

train, distant objects seem 

to move in the same 

direction as the train 

whereas nearby ones 

apparently move in the 

opposite direction.This is 

motion parallax.

based on the small discrepancy in the retinal

Two possibilities are additivity (adding together

using information from a single cue) (Bruno 

and Cutting, 1988). In fact, cues are sometimes 

combined in more complex ways.
Jacobs (2002) argued that, when we com-
bine information from multiple visual cues, we 

assign more weight to 
reliable
 cues than to 

unreliable
 ones. Since cues that are reliable in 

one context may be less so in another context, 

we need to be 
ß exible
 in our assessments of 

cue reliability. These notions led Jacobs to pro-

pose two hypotheses:
Less ambiguous cues (e.g., ones that pro-
(1) 
vide consistent information) are regarded 

as more reliable than more ambiguous 

ones. For example, binocular disparity 

provides inconsistent information because 

its value is much less for distant objects 

than for close ones.

A cue is regarded as reliable if inferences

based on it are consistent with those 

based on other available cues.

Something similar occurs with the auto-
stereograms found in the Magic Eye books. 

An 
autostereogram
 is a two-dimensional image 
containing depth information so that it appears 

three-dimensional when viewed appropriately 

(you can see an autostereogram of a shark if 

you access the 
Wikipedia
 entry for autostereo-

gram). What happens with autostereograms is 

that repeating two-dimensional patterns are 

presented to each eye. If you do not match the 

patterns correctly, then two adjacent patterns 

will form an object that appears to be at a 

different depth from the background. If you 

only glance at an autostereogram, all you can 

see is a two-dimensional pattern. However, if 

you stare at it and strive 
not
 to bring it into 

focus, you can (sooner or later) see a three-

dimensional image. Many people still have 

problems in seeing the three-dimensional image 

Ðwhat often helps is to hold the auto"

very slowly away while preventing it from com-

Studies of the brain have indicated that 
most regions of the visual cortex contain 

neurons responding strongly to binocular dis-

parity. This suggests that the dorsal and ventral 

processing streams are both involved in stere-

opsis. Their respective roles have recently been 

clariÞ
 ed after a period of some controversy 
(Parker, 2007). We start by distinguishing be-

tween absolute disparity and relative disparity. 

Absolute disparity is based on the differences 

in the images of a 
single
 object presented to 

both eyes. In contrast, relative disparity is 

based on differences in the absolute disparities 

of 
two
 objects. It allows us to assess the spatial 
relationship between the two objects in three-

dimensional space.
The dorsal and ventral streams both pro-
cess absolute and relative disparity. However, 

there is incomplete processing of relative dis-

parity in the dorsal stream, but it is sufÞ
 cient 
to assist in navigation. In contrast, there is 

more complete processing of relative disparity 

in the ventral stream. This processing is of

2 BASIC PROCESSES IN VISUAL PERCEPTION 
73
Experimentation in this area has beneÞ
 ted 
from advances in virtual reality technologies. 
These advances permit researchers to con-

trol visual cues very precisely and to provide 

observers with virtual environments that could 

not exist in the real world.

parallel ß at surfaces were arranged in depth. 

Observers viewed the displays monocularly, 

and there were four sources of depth infor-

mation: relative size; height in the projection 

plane; interposition; and motion parallax. The 

Þ
 ndings supported the additivity notion.
Bruno and Cutting (1988) did not study 
what happens when two or more cues provide 

conß icting
 information about depth. In such 

circumstances, observers sometimes use the 

selection strategy and ignore some of the 

available depth cues. For example, consider 

the Òhollow faceÓ illusion (Gregory, 1973), in 

which stereoscopic information is ignored (dis-

cussed earlier in the chapter). When a hollow 

mask of a face is viewed from a few feet away, 

it is perceived as a normal face because of our 

familiarity with such faces.
A common situation in which we experi-
ence a substantial conß ict among cues is at 

the movies. We use the selection strategy: per-

spective and texture cues are used, whereas 

we ignore the binocular disparity and motion 

parallax cues indicating that everything we can 

see is the same distance from us.
Evidence supporting JacobsÕ (2002) Þ
 rst 
hypothesis was reported by Triesch, Ballard, 

and Jacobs (2002). They used a virtual real-

ity situation in which observers tracked an 

object deÞ ned by the visual attributes of colour, 

shape, and size. On each trial, two of these 

attributes were unreliable (their values changed 

frequently). The observers attached increasing 

weight to the reliable cue and less to the unreli-

able cues during the course of each trial.
Evidence supporting JacobsÕ (2002) second 
hypothesis was reported by Atkins, Fiser, 

and Jacobs (2001). 
They used a virtual reality 
environment in 
which observers viewed and 

grasped elliptical cylinders. There were three 

cues to cylinder depth: texture, motion, and 

haptic
 (relating to the sense of touch). When 

the haptic and texture cues i"

cylinder depth but the motion cue indicated a 

different depth, observers made increasing use 

of the texture cue and decreasing use of the 

motion cue. When the haptic and motion cues 

indicated the same cylinder depth but the 

texture cue did not, observers increasingly relied 

on the motion cue and tended to disregard the 

texture cue. Thus, whichever visual cue corre-

lated 
with the haptic cue was preferred, and 
this preference increased with practice.
Where in the brain is information about 
different depth cues integrated? Tsutsui, Taira, 

and Sakata (2005) considered this issue. They 

discussed much research suggesting that inte-

gration occurs in the caudal intraparietal sulcus. 

More speciÞ cally, they argued that this is the 

brain area in which a three-dimensional rep-

resentation of objects is formed on the basis 

of information from several depth cues.
Conclusions
Information from different depth cues is typic-

ally combined to produce accurate depth per-

ception, and this often happens in an additive 

fashion. However, there are several situations 

(especially those in which different cues conß
 ict 
strongly with each other) in which one cue is 

dominant over others. This makes sense. If, 

for example, one cue suggests an object is 10 

metres away and another cue suggests it is 90 

metres away, splitting the difference and deciding 

it is 50 metres away is unlikely to be correct! 

However, such situations are probably much 

more likely to occur in the virtual environments 

created by scientists than in the real world.
There is much support for JacobsÕ (2002) 
view that we attach more weight to cues that 

provide reliable information and that provide 
haptic:
 relating to the sense of touch.

Lichten and Lurie 

(1950) removed all depth cues, and found that 

observers relied totally on retinal image size in 

their judgements of object size.
If size judgements depend on perceived 
distance, then size constancy should not be 

found when the perceived distance of an object 

differs considerably from its actual distance. 

The Ames room provides a good example 

(Ames, 1952; see Figure 2.21). It has a peculiar 

shape: the ß
 oor slopes and the rear wall is not 
at right angles to the adjoining walls. In spite 

of this, the Ames room creates the same retinal 

image as a normal rectangular room when 

viewed through a peephole. The fact that one 

end of the rear wall is much farther from the 

viewer is disguised by making it much higher. 

The cues suggesting that the rear wall is at right 

angles to the viewer are so strong that observers 

mistakenly assume that two adults standing in 

the corners by the rear wall are at the same 

distance from 
them. This leads them to estimate 
the size of the nearer adult as much greater 

than that of the adult who is farther away.
The illusion effect with the Ames room is 
so great than an individual walking backwards 

and forwards in front of the rear wall seems 

to grow and shrink as he/she moves! Thus, 

perceived distance seems to drive perceived 

size. However, observers are more likely to 

realise what is going on if the individual is 

someone they know very well. There is an 

anecdote about a researcherÕs wife who arrived 

at the laboratory to Þ nd him inside the Ames 

room. She immediately said, ÒGee, honey, that 

roomÕs distorted!Ó (Ian Gordon, personal 

communication).

 ndings were

Size constancy
Size constancy
 is the tendency for any given 

object to appear the same size whether its size 

in the retinal image is large or small. For example, 

if someone walks towards you, their retinal 

image increases progressively but their size seems 

to remain the same.
Why do we show size constancy? Many 
factors are involved. However, an objectÕs 

apparent distance is especially important when 

judging its size. For example, an object may 

be judged to be large even though its retinal 

image is very small if it is a long way away. The  

reason why size constancy is often not shown 

when we look at objects on the ground from the  

top of a tall building may be because it is hard 

to judge distance accurately. These ideas were 

incorporated into the sizeÐ distance invariance 

hypothesis (Kilpatrick & Ittelson, 1953). Accord-

ing to this hypothesis, for a given size of retinal  

image, the perceived size of an object is pro-

portional to its perceived distance. As we will 

see, this hypothesis is more applicable to un-

familiar objects than to familiar ones.
Evidence
Findings consistent with the sizeÐdistance invari-

ance hypothesis were reported by Holway and 

Boring (1941). Observers sat at the intersection 

of two hallways. A test circle was presented 

in one hallway and a comparison circle in the 

other. The test circle could be of various sizes 

and at various distances, and the observersÕ 

task was to adjust the comparison circle to 

make it the same size as the test circle. Their 

performance was very good when depth cues 

were available. However, it became poor when 

depth cues were removed by placing curtains

Luo et al. (2007) considered the effects 
of scene complexity, binocular disparity, and 
motion parallax on size constancy in a virtual 

environment. Scene complexity and binocular 

disparity both contributed to size constancy. 

However, motion parallax (whether produced 

by movement of the virtual environment or of 

the observer) did not.
Bertamini, Yang, and ProfÞ tt (1998) argued  
that the horizon provides useful information 

because the line connecting the point of obser-

vation to the horizon is virtually parallel to 

the ground. For example, if your eyes are 

1.5 metres above the ground, then an object 

appearing to be the same height as the horizon 

is 1.5 metres tall. Size judgements were most 

accurate when objects were at about eye level, 

whether observers were standing or sitting 

(Bertamini et al., 1998).
Haber and Levin (2001) argued that size 
perception of objects typically depends on 

memory
 of their familiar size rather than solely 

on perceptual information concerning their 

distance from the observer. They initially found 

that participants estimated the sizes of common 

objects with great accuracy purely on the basis 
walked through a virtual-reality room as it 

expanded or contracted considerably. Even 

though they had considerable information from 

motion parallax and motion to indicate that 

the roomÕs size was changing, no participants 

noticed the changes! There were large errors 

in participantsÕ judgements of the sizes of 

objects at longer distances. The powerful expect-

ation that the size of the room would not alter 

caused the perceived distance of the objects to 

be very inaccurate.

condition did not correlate with perceived

of memory. In another experiment, they pre-
sented observers with various objects at close 

viewing range (0 Ð50 metres) or distant viewing  

range (50 Ð100 metres) and asked them to make 

size judgements. The objects belonged to three 

categories: (1) those most invariant in size or 

height (e.g., tennis racquet, bicycle); (2) those 

varying in size (e.g., television set, Christmas 

tree); and (3) unfamiliar stimuli (e.g., ovals, 

triangles).
What Þ ndings would we expect? If familiar  
size is of major importance, then size judge-

ments should be better for objects of invariant 

size than those of variable size, with size judge-

ments worst for unfamiliar objects. What if 

distance perception is all-important? Distances 

are estimated more accurately for nearby objects 

than for more distant ones, so size judgements 

should be better for all categories of objects at 

close than at distant viewing range.
Haber and LevinÕs (2001) Þ
 ndings indicated 
the importance of familiar size to accuracy of 

size judgements (see Figure 2.21). However, 

we obviously cannot explain the fairly high 

accuracy of size judgements with unfamiliar 

objects in terms of familiar size. It can also be 

seen in Figure 2.22 that the viewing distance 

had practically no effect on size judgements.

that objects look larger when we have the

That would explain why the hole always looks 

remarkably small to the Þ rst author when he 

is playing a round of golf!
Evaluation
Size perception and size constancy depend 

mainly on perceived distance. Some of the 

strongest evidence for this comes from studies 

in which misperceptions of distance (e.g., in the 

Ames room) produce systematic distortions in 

perceived size. Several other factors, including 

the horizon, scene complexity, familiar size, 

and purposeful interactions, also contribute 

to size judgements.
What is lacking so far are comprehensive 
theories of size judgements. Little is known 

about the relative importance of the factors 

inß
 uencing size judgements or of the circum-
stances in which any given factor is more or 

less inß uential. In addition, we do not know 

how the various factors combine to produce 

size judgements.

2 BASIC PROCESSES IN VISUAL PERCEPTION

 Brain systems
¥ 
In the retina, there are cones (specialised for colour vision) and "
Segment_140,"rods (specialised for movement  detection). The main route between the eye and the cortex is the retinaÐgeniculateÐstriate   pathway, which is divided into partially separate P and M pathways.

detection). The main route between the eye and the cortex is the retinaÐgeniculateÐstriate 

pathway, which is divided into partially separate P and M pathways. The dorsal pathway 

terminates in the parietal cortex and the ventral pathway terminates in the inferotemporal 

cortex. According to ZekiÕ
s functional specialisation theory, different parts of the cortex 
are specialised for different visual functions. This is supported by Þ ndings from patients 

with selective visual deÞ cits (e.g., achromatopsia, akinetopsia), but there is much less 

specialisation than claimed by Zeki. One solution to the binding problem (integrating 

the distributed information about an object) is the synchrony hypothesis. According to 

this hypothesis, coherent visual perception requires synchronous activity in several brain 

areas. It is doubtful whether precise synchrony is achievable.
 Two visual systems: perception and action
¥ 
According to Milner and Goodale, there is a vision-for-perception system based on the ventral 

pathway and a vision-for-action system based on the dorsal pathway
. Predicted double 
dissociations have been found between patients with optic ataxia (damage to the dorsal 

stream) and visual agnosia (damage to the ventral stream). Illusory effects found with visual  

illusions when perceptual judgements are made (ventral stream) are greatly reduced when 

grasping or pointing responses (dorsal stream) are used. Grasping or reaching for an object 

also involves the ventral stream when memory or planning is involved or the action is 

awkward. The two visual systems interact and combine with each more than is implied 

by Milner and Goodale.
 Colour vision
¥ 
Colour vision helps us to detect objects and to make Þ ne discriminations among them. 

According to dual-process theory (based on previous research), there are three types of cone
 
receptor and also three types of opponent processes (greenÐred, blueÐyellow, and wh"

black). This theory explains the existence of negative afterimages and several kinds of colour 

deÞ
 ciency. Colour constancy occurs when a surface seems to have the same colour when 
there is a change in the illuminant. A theory based on cone-excitation ratios provides an 

inß
 uential account of colour constancy. Chromatic adaptation and top-down factors (e.g., 
knowledge, familiarity of object colour) are also involved in colour constancy. Local contrast  

and global contrast are of particular importance, but reß ected highlights from glossy objects 

and mutual reß ections are additional factors. Cells in V4 demonstrate colour constancy.
 Perception without awareness
¥ 
Patients with extensive damage to V1 sometimes suffer from blindsight Ð they can respond 

to visual stimuli in the absence of conscious visual awareness. There are three subtypes: 

action-blindsight, attention-blindsight, and agnosopsia. The visual abilities of most 
blindsight patients seem to involve primarily the dorsal stream of processing. Subliminal 
perception can be assessed using a subjective threshold or a more stringent objective 

threshold. There is strong evidence for subliminal perception using both types of threshold.
 
Functional neuroimaging studies indicate that extensive visual processing in the absence 

of conscious awareness is possible.

window of a plane during our descent are 
actually people.
In spite of the above complexities, we can go 

beyond simply identifying objects in the visual 

environment. For example, we can generally 

describe what an object would look like if viewed 

from a different angle, and we also know its 

uses and functions. All in all, there is much 

more to object recognition than might initially 

be supposed (than meets the eye?).
What is covered in this chapter? The over-
arching theme is to unravel some of the mysteries 

involved in object recognition. We start by 

considering how we see which parts of the 

visual world belong together and thus form 

separate objects. This is a crucial early stage 

in object recognition. After that, we consider 

more general theories of object recognition. 

These theories are evaluated in the light of 

behavioural experiments, neuroimaging studies, 

and studies on brain-damaged patients. There 

is much evidence suggesting that face recogni-

tion (which is vitally important in our everyday 

lives) differs in important ways from ordinary 

object recognition. Accordingly, we discuss face 

recognition in a separate section. Finally, we 

address the issue of whether the processes 

involved in visual 
imagery
 of objects resemble 

those involved in visual 
perception
 of objects. 

Note that some other issues relating to object 

recognition (e.g., depth perception, size con-

stancy) were discussed in Chapter 2.
INTRODUCTION
Tens of thousands of times every day we identify 

or recognise objects in 
the world around us. 

At this precise moment, you are aware that 

you are looking at a book (possibly with your 

eyes glazed over). If you raise your eyes, per-

haps you can see a wall, windows, and so on 

in front of you. Object recognition typically 

occurs so effortlessly it is hard to believe "

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
PERCEPTUAL 
ORGANISATION
A basic issue in visual perception is 
perceptual 
segregation
, which involves working out which 
parts of the presented visual information form 

separate objects. It seems reasonable to assume 

that perceptual segregation is completed before 

object recognition occurs. Thus, we work out 

where
 the object is before deciding 
what
 it is. 

In fact, that is an oversimpliÞ
 ed view.
The Þ
 rst systematic attempt to study 
perceptual segregation (and the perceptual 

organisation to which it gives rise) was made by  

t he Gestaltists. They were German psychologists 

(including Koffka, Kıhler, and Wertheimer) who 

emigrated to the United States between 
the two 
world wars. Their fundamental principle w a s

Most of the GestaltistsÕ other laws can be 
subsumed under the law of Pr−gnanz. Figure 3.1a 

illustrates the law of proximity, according to 

which visual elements close in space tend to 

be grouped together. Figure 3.1b illustrates the 
law of similarity, according to which similar 

elements tend to be grouped together. We see 

two crossing lines in Figure 3.1c because, 

according to the law of good continuation, we 

group together those elements requiring the 

fewest changes or interruptions in straight or 

smoothly curving lines. Figure 3.1d illustrates 

the law of closure: the missing parts of a Þ
 gure 
are Þ lled in to complete the Þ gure (here, a 

circle). The Gestaltists claimed no learning is 

needed for us to use these various laws.
Evidence supporting the Gestalt approach 
was reported by Pomerantz (1981). Observers 

viewed four-item visual arrays and tried to 

identify rapidly the one different from the 

others. When the array was simple but could 

not easily be organised, it took an average of 

1.9 seconds to perform the task. However,

Other Gestalt laws are discussed in Chapter 4. 
For example, there is the law of common fate,  

according to which visual elements moving 

together are grouped together. Johans"

attached lights to the joints of an actor wearing  

dark clothes, and then Þ lmed him moving

moving human Þ
 gure when he walked around, 
although they could only see the lights.
The Gestaltists emphasised 
Þ gure
Ð
ground 
segregation 
in perceptual organisation. One 
part of the visual Þ eld is identiÞ ed as the Þ
 gure, 
whereas the rest of the visual Þ eld is less impor-

tant and so forms the ground. The Gestaltists 

claimed that the Þ gure is perceived as having 

a distinct form or shape, whereas the ground 

lacks form. In addition, the Þgure is perceived 

as being in front of the ground, and the contour 

separating the Þ gure from the ground belongs 

to the Þ
 gure. Check the validity of these claims 
by looking at the facesÐgoblet illusion (see 

Figure 3.2). When the goblet is the Þ
 gure, it 
seems to be in front of a dark background; in 

contrast, the faces are in front of a light back-

ground when forming the Þ
 gure.
There is more attention to (and processing 
of ) the Þ gure than of the ground. Weisstein and 

Wong (1986) ß
 ashed vertical lines and 
slightly 
tilted lines onto the facesÐgoblet 
illusion, 
and gave 
observers the task of deciding whether the line 

was vertical. Performance on this task was three 

t imes better when the line was presented to what 

the observers perceived as the Þ gure than the 

ground. In addition, processing of the ground 

representation is suppressed. Stimuli with clear 

Þ
 gureÐground organisation were associated with 
suppression of the ground representation in 

early visual areas V1 and V2 (Likova & Tyler, 

2008). The combination of 
greater attention to 
the figure and active 
suppression of the ground 
helps to explain why the Þ gure is perceived 

much more clearly than the ground.
Evidence
What happens when different laws of organisa-

tion 
are in conß ict? This issue was de-emphasised 
by the Gestaltists but investigated by Quinlan 

"
Segment_147,"and Wilton (1998). For example, they presented   a display such as the one in Figure 3.3a, in   which there is a conß ict between proximity and   similarity. About half the participants grouped   the stimuli by proximity and half by similarity.   Quinlan and Wilton also used more complex   displays",Explores how memory influences cognition.,"awareness, recognition, perception",Nested under Chapter on perception,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in memory,Aligned with contemporary studies on emotion,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_1050,"and Wilton (1998).

Quinlan and Wilton also used more complex 

displays like those shown in Figure 3.3b and

following notions:
The visual elements in a display are initi-

ally grouped or clustered on the basis of

proximity.

Additional processes are used if elements

provisionally clustered together differ in one

or more features (within-cluster mismatch).

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
If there is a within-cluster mismatch on
¥
features but a between-cluster match
(e.g., Figure 3.3a), then observers choose

between grouping based on proximity or

on similarity.

If
there are within-cluster and between-cluster
¥ 
mismatches, then proximity is ignored, and

grouping is often based on colour. In the

case of the displays shown in Figures 3.3b

and 3.3c, most observers grouped on the

basis of common colour rather than com-

mon shape.
The GestaltistsÕ approach was limited in that
they mostly studied artiÞ
 cial Þ
 gures, making 
it important to see whether their Þ
 ndings apply 
to more realistic stimuli. Geisler, Perry, Super, 

and Gallogly (2001) used pictures to study in 

detail the contours of ß owers, a river, trees, and 

so on. The contours of objects could be worked  

out very well using two principles different 

from those emphasised by the Gestaltists:
Adjacent segments of any contour typically

Segment_148,have very similar orientations.  Segments of any contour that are further  (2)  apart generally have somewhat different   orientations. Geisler et al. (2001) presented observers  with two complex patterns at the same time;   they decided which pattern contained a winding   contour.

have very similar orientations.

Segments of any contour that are further 
(2) 
apart generally have somewhat different 

orientations.
Geisler et al. (2001) presented observers 
with two complex patterns at the same time; 

they decided which pattern contained a winding 

contour. T
ask performance was predicted very 
well from the two key principles described 

above. These Þ ndings suggest that we use our 

extensive knowledge of real objects when 

making decisions about contours.
Elder and Goldberg (2002) also used pictures 
of natural objects in their study. However, they 

obtained more support for the Gestalt laws. 

Proximity was a very powerful cue when deciding 

which contours belonged to which 
objects. In  

addition, the cue of good continuation 
also 
made a positive contribution.
Palmer and Rock (1994) proposed a new 
principle of visual organisation termed 
uniform 
connectedness
. According to this principle, 

any connected region having uniform visual 

properties (e.g., colour, texture, lightness) tends 

to be organised as a single perceptual unit. 

Palmer and Rock argued that uniform con-

nectedness can be more powerful than Gestalt 

grouping laws such as proximity and similarity.  

They also argued that it occurs 
prior
 to the 

operation of these other laws. This argument 

was supported by Þ ndings that grouping by 

uniform connectedness dominated over prox-

imity and similarity when these grouping 

principles were in conß
 ict.
Uniform connectedness may be less impor-
tant than assumed by Palmer and Rock (1994). 

Han, Humphreys, and Chen (1999) assessed 

discrimination speed for visual stimuli, with 

the elements of the stimuli being grouped 

by proximity, by similarity, or by uniform

connectedness. They found that grouping by 
similarity of shapes was perceived relatively 

slowly, but grouping by proximity was as rapid 

as grouping by uniform connectedness. These 

Þ
 ndings suggest that grouping by uniform con-
nectedness does not occur prior to grouping 

by proximity. In subsequent research, Han and 

Humphreys (2003) found that grouping by 

proximity was as fast as grouping by uniform 

connectedness when one or two objects were 

presented. However, grouping by uniform 

connectedness was faster than grouping by 

proximity when more objects were presented. 

Thus, uniform connectedness may be especially 

important when observers are presented with 

multiple objects.
The Gestaltists argued that the various laws 
of grouping typically operate in a bottom-up 

(or stimulus-driven) way to produce perceptual 

organisation. If so, Þ
 gureÐground segregation 
should not be affected by past knowledge or 

attentional processes. If, as mentioned earlier, 

we decide where an object is before we work 

out what it is, then Þ
 gureÐground segregation 
must occur before object recognition. As we 

will see, the evidence does not support the 

Gestaltist position.
Kimchi and Hadad (2002) found that past 
experience influenced speed of perceptual 

grouping. Students at an Israeli university were 

presented with Hebrew letters upright or upside 

down and with their lines connected or discon-

nected. Perceptual grouping occurred within 

40 ms for all types of stimuli except discon-

nected letters presented upside down, for which 

considerably more time was required. Perceptual

The issue of whether attentional processes

 gureÐground segregation was 
addressed by Vecera, Flevaris, and Filapek 

(2004). Observers were presented with displays 

consisting of a convex region (curving out-

wards) and a concave region (curving inwards) 

(see Figure 3.4), because previous research had 
shown that convex regions are much more 

likely than concave ones to be perceived as 

the Þ
 gure. In addition, a visual cue (a small 
rectangle) was sometimes presented to one of 

the regions to manipulate attentional processes. 

After that, two probe shapes were presented, 

and observers decided rapidly which shape had 

appeared in the previous display.
What did Vecera et al. (2004) Þ
 nd? The 
effect of convexity on Þ
 gureÐground assign-
ment was 40% smaller when the visual cue 

was in the concave region than when it was in 

the convex region (see Figure 3.5). This indi-

cates that spatial attention can occur 
before
 

the completion of Þ
 gureÐground processes. 
However, attention is not 
always
 necessary for 

Þ
 gureÐground segmentation. When observers 
were presented with very simple stimuli, they 

processed information about Þ gure and ground 

even when their attention was directed to a 

separate visual task (Kimchi & Peterson, 2008). 

It is likely that Þ gureÐground processing can 

occur in the absence of attention provided that 

the stimuli are relatively simple and do not 

require complex processing.

The assumption that Þ
 gureÐground segre-
gation always 
precedes object recognition was 
tested by Grill-Spector and Kanwisher (2005). 

Photographs were presented for between 17 ms 

a nd 167 ms followed by a mask. On some trials, 

participants performed an object detection task 

based on deciding whether the photograph 

contained an object to assess Þ
 gureÐground 
segregation. On other trials, participants carried 

out an object categorisation task (e.g., deciding 

whether the photograph showed an object from  

a given category such as ÒcarÓ). Surprisingly, 

reaction times and error rates on both tasks 

were extremely similar. In another experiment, 

Grill-Spector and Kanwisher asked participants  

to perform the object detection and categorisa-

tion tasks on each trial. When the object was 

not detected, categorisation performance was 

at chance level; when the object was not 

categorised accurately, detection performance 

was at chance.
The above Þ ndings imply that top-down 
processes are important in Þ
 gureÐground 
segregation. They also imply that the processes 

involved in Þ gureÐground segregation are very 

similar to those involved in object recognition. 

Indeed, Grill-Spector and Kanwisher (2005, 

p. 158) concluded that, ÒConscious object 

segmentation and categorisation are based on 

the same mechanism.Ó
Mack, Gauthier, Sadr, and Palmeri (2008) 
cast doubt on the above conclusion. Like Grill-

Spector and Kanwisher (2005), they compared 

performance on object detection (i.e., is an 

object there?) and object categorisation (i.e., 

what object is it) tasks. However, they used 

conditions in which objects were inverted or 

degraded to make object categorisation more 

difÞ
 cult. In those conditions, object categorisation  
performance was signiÞ cantly worse than object 

detection, suggesting that object categorisation 

is more complex and may involve somewhat 

different process"

aspects of perceptual organisation. As Rock 

and Palmer (1990, p. 50) pointed out, ÒThe 

laws of grouping have withstood the test of 

time. In fact, not one of them has been refuted.Ó 

In addition, the Gestaltists focused on key 

issues: it is of fundamental importance to 

understand the processes underlying perceptual 

organisation.
There are many limitations with the Gestalt 
approach. First, nearly all the evidence the 

Gestaltists provided for their principles of 

perceptual organisation was based on two-

dimensional line drawings. Second, they 
pro-

duced 
descriptions
 of interesting perceptual 
phenomena, but failed to provide adequate 

explanations
. Third, the Gestaltists did not 

consider fully what happens when different 

perceptual laws are in conß
 ict (Quinlan & 
Wilton, 1998). Fourth, the Gestaltists did not 

identify all the principles of perceptual organisa-

tion. 
For example, uniform connectedness may 
be as important as the Gestalt principles (e.g.,

In sum, top-down processes (e.g., based on 
knowledge of objects and their shapes) and 

bottom-up or stimulus-driven processes are 

typically both used to maximise the efÞ
 ciency 
of Þ gureÐground segregation. Top-down pro-

cesses may have been unnecessary to produce 

Þ
 gureÐground segregation with the typically 
very simple shapes used by the Gestaltists, as 

is suggested by the Þ ndings of Kimchi and 

Peterson (2008). However, natural scenes are 

often sufÞ ciently complex and ambiguous that 

top-down processes based on object knowledge 

are very useful in achieving satisfactory Þ
 gureÐ
ground segregation. Instead of Þ
 gureÐground 
segregation based on bottom-up processing 

preceding object recognition involving top-

down processing, segregation and recognition 

may involve similar bottom-up and top-down 

processes (Grill-Spector & Kanwisher, 2005). 

However, this conclusion is disputed by Mack 

et al. (2008). Theoretical ideas concerning the 

ways in which bottom-up and top-down pro-

cesses might combine to produce Þ

THEORIES OF OBJECT 
RECOGNITION
Object recognition (identifying objects in the 
visual Þ eld) is of enormous importance to us. 

As Peissig and Tarr (2007, p. 76) pointed out, 

ÒObject identiÞ cation is a primary end state 

of visual processing and a critical precursor to 

interacting with and reasoning about the world. 
Thus, the question of how we recognise objects 

is both perceptual and cognitive.Ó
Numerous theories of object recognition 
have been put forward over the years (see 

Peissig & Tarr, 2007, for a historical review). 

The most inßuential theorist "
Segment_154,"in this area has   probably been David Marr, whose landmark   book,  Vision: A computational   investigation  into the human representation and processing   of visual information , was published in 1982.   He put forward a computational theory of   the processes involved in object recognition.   He",Explores how emotion influences cognition.,"perception, memory, emotion",Nested under Chapter on attention,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in awareness,Aligned with contemporary studies on recognition,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_1037,"in this area has 

probably been David Marr, whose landmark 

book, 
Vision: A computational
 
investigation 
into the human representation and processing 

of visual information
, was published in 1982. 

He put forward a computational theory of 

the processes involved in object recognition. 

He proposed a series of representations (i.e., 

descriptions) providing increasingly detailed 

information about the visual environment:
Primal sketch
¥
: this provides a two-dimensional
description of the main light-intensity changes
in the visual input, including information

about edges, contours, and blobs.

2.5-D sketch
¥
: this incorporates a descrip-
tion of the depth and orientation of visible

surfaces, making use of information pro-

vided by shading, texture, motion, binocular
disparity, and so on. Like the primal
sketch, it is observer
-centred or viewpoint
dependent.

3-D model representation
¥
: this describes
three-dimensionally the shapes of objects

and their relative positions independent of

the observerÕs viewpoint (it is thus viewpoint
invariant).
Irving BiedermanÕs (1987) recognition-by-
components theory represents a development 

and extension of MarrÕ
s theory. We start by 
considering BiedermanÕs approach beforemov-

ing on to more recent theories.
BiedermanÕs recognition-by-
components theory
The central assumption of BiedermanÕs (1987, 
1990) recognition-by-components theory is that 

objects consist of basic shapes or components 

known as ÒgeonsÓ (geometric ions). Examples 

of geons are blocks, cylinders, spheres, arcs,

and wedges. According to Biederman (1987), 
there are approximately 36 different geons. That 

may seem suspiciously few to provide descrip-

tions of all the objects we can recognise and 

identify. However, we can identify enormous 

numbers of spoken English words even tho"
Segment_155,ugh   there are only approximately 44 phonemes   (basic sounds) in the English language. This is   because these phonemes can be arranged in   almost endless combinations.

there are only approximately 44 phonemes 

(basic sounds) in the English language. This is 

because these phonemes can be arranged in 

almost endless combinations. The same is true 

of geons: part of the reason for the richness of 

the object descriptions provided by geons stems 

from the different possible spatial relationships 

among them. For example, a cup can be described 

by an arc connected to the side of a cylinder, 

and a pail can be described by the same two 

geons, but with the arc connected to the top 

of the cylinder.
The essence of recognition-by-components 
theory is shown in Figure 3.6. The stage we 

have discussed is that of the determination of 

the components or geons of a visual object and 

their relationships. When this information is 

available, it is matched with stored object rep-

resentations or structural models containing 
information about the nature of the relevant 

geons, their orientations, sizes, and so on. The 

identiÞ
 cation of any given visual object is deter-
mined by whichever stored object representa-

tion provides the best Þ t with the component- or 

geon-based information obtained from the 

visual object.
As indicated in Figure 3.6, the Þ rst step in 
object recognition is edge extraction. Biederman 

(1987, p. 117) described this as follows: Ò[There 

is] an early edge extraction stage, responsive 

to differences in surface characteristics, namely, 

luminance, texture, or colour, providing a line 

drawing description of the object.Ó
The next step is to decide how a visual 
object should be segmented to establish its 

parts or components. Biederman (1987) argued 

that the concave parts of an objectÕs contour 

are of particular value in accomplishing the 

task of segmenting the visual image into parts. 

The importance of concave and convex regions  

was discussed earlier (Vecera e t  
al., 2004).
The other major element is to decide which  
edge information from an object possesses the 

impo"

According to   Biederman (1987), there are Þ ve such invariant    properties of edges: Curvature ¥  : points on a curve Parallel ¥  : sets of points in parallel Cotermination ¥  : edges terminating at a com- mon point  S",Explores how awareness influences cognition.,"attention, memory, recognition",Nested under Chapter on awareness,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in emotion,Aligned with contemporary studies on perception,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_1068,"rtant characteristic of remaining invariant  

across different viewing angles. According to 

Biederman (1987), there are Þ ve such invariant  

properties of edges:

: sets of points in parallel
Cotermination

According to the theory, the components 
or geons of a visual object are constructed 

from these invariant properties. For example, 

a cylinder has curved edges and two parallel 

edges connecting the curved edges, whereas a 

brick has three parallel edges and no curved 

edges. Biederman (1987, p. 116) argued that

points on each edge. Consequently, they 
allow a primitive (component or geon) 

to be extracted with great tolerance for 

variations of viewpoint, occlusions 

(obstructions), and noise.
This part of the theory leads to the key 
prediction that object recognition is typically 
viewpoint-invariant, meaning an object can be 

recognised equally easily from nearly all viewing 

angles. (Note that Marr (1982) assumed that 

the three-dimensional model representation was 
viewpoint-invariant.) Why is this prediction 
made? Object recognition depends crucially 

on the identiÞ
 cation of geons, which can be 
identiÞ
 ed from a great variety of viewpoints. 
It follows that object recognition from a given 

viewing angle would be difÞ cul"

An important part of BiedermanÕs (1987) 
theory with respect to the invariant properties 

is the Ònon-accidentalÓ principle. According 

to this principle, regularities in the visual image 

reß
 ect actual (or non-accidental) regularities in 
the world rather than depending on accidental 

characteristics of a given viewpoint. Thus, for 

example, a two-dimensional symmetry in the 

visual image is assumed to indicate symmetry 

in the three-dimensional object. Use of the 

non-accidental principle occasionally leads to 

error. For example, a straight line in a visual 

image usually reß ects a straight edge in the 

world, but it might not (e.g., a bicycle viewed 

end on).
How do we recognise objects when condi-
tions are suboptimal (e.g., an intervening object 

obscures part of the target object)? Biederman 

(1987) argued that the following factors are 

important in such conditions:
The invariant properties (e.g., curvature,
¥
parallel lines) of an object can still be

detected even when only parts of edges are

visible.

Provided the concavities of a contour are
¥
visible, there are mechanisms allowing

the missing parts of the contour to be

restored.
There is generally much 
¥
redundant
 infor-
mation available for recognising complex

objects, and so they can still be recognised

when some geons or components are missing.

For example, a giraffe could be identiÞ
 ed
from its neck even if its legs were hidden

from view.
Evidence
The central prediction of BiedermanÕs (1987, 

1990) recognition-by-components theory is 

that object recognition is viewpoint-invariant. 

Biederman and Gerhardstein (1993) obtained 

support for that prediction in an experiment 

in which a to-be-named object was preceded 

by a prime. Object naming was priming as well 
 
when there was an angular change of 135¡ 

as when the two views of the object and when 

the two views were identical. Biederman and 

Gerhardstein use"

 edviewpoints. 
Object recognition was viewpoint-dependent, 

with performance being better when familiar 

viewpoints were used rather than unfamiliar 

ones.
It could be argued that developing ex-
pertise 
with given objects produces a shift from 
viewpoint-dependent to viewpoint-invariant 

recognition. However, Gauthier and Tarr (2002) 

found no evidence of such a shift. Observers 

received seven hours of practice in learning to 

identify Greebles (artiÞ cial objects belonging to 

various ÒfamiliesÓ; see Figure 3.7). Two Greebles 

were presented in rapid succession, and observers 

decided whether the second Greeble was the 

same as the Þ rst. The second Greeble was pre-

sented at the same orientation as the Þ
 rst, or 
at various other orientations up to 75¡.
Gauthier and TarrÕs (2002) Þ
 ndings are 
shown in Figure 3.8. There was a general increase 

in speed as expertise developed. However,

performance remained strongly viewpoint-
dependent throughout the experiment. Such 

Þ
 ndings are hard to reconcile with BiedermanÕs 
emphasis on viewpoint-invariant recognition.
Support for recognition-by-components 
theory was reported by Biederman (1987). He 

presented observers with degraded line drawings  

of objects (see Figure 3.9). Object recognition 

was much harder to achieve when parts of the 
contour providing information about concavities 

were omitted than when other parts of the 

contour were deleted. This conÞ rms that con-

cavities are important for object recognition.
Support for the "
Segment_159,"importance of geons was  obtained by Cooper and Biederman (1993) and   Vogels, Biederman, Bar, and Lorincz (2001).   Cooper and Biederman (1993) asked observers   to decide whether two objects presented in   rapid succession had the same name (e.g., hat).   There were two conditions in which the two",Explores how emotion influences cognition.,"attention, emotion, memory",Nested under Chapter on perception,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in attention,Aligned with contemporary studies on attention,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_744,"importance of geons was 
obtained by Cooper and Biederman (1993) and 

Vogels, Biederman, Bar, and Lorincz (2001). 

Cooper and Biederman (1993) asked observers 

to decide whether two objects presented in 

rapid succession had the same name (e.g., hat). 

There were two conditions in which the two 

objects shared the same name but were not 

identical: (1) one of the geons was changed 

(e.g., from a top hat to a bowler hat); and (2) 

the second object was larger or smaller than 

the Þ rst. Task performance was signiÞ
 cantly 
worse when a geon changed than when it did 

not. Vogels et al. (2001) assessed the response 

of individual neurons in inferior temporal cortex 

to changes in a geon compared to changes in 

the size of an object with no change in the geon. 

Some neurons responded more to geon changes 

than to changes in object size, thus providing 

some support for the reality of geons.
According to the theory, object recognition 
depends on edge information rather than on 

surface information (e.g., colour). However,

when objects are presented in the context of 

other objects rather than on their own. This is 

because it 
can be difÞ cult to decide which edges 

belong to 
which object when several objects 
are presented together. Sanocki et al. presented 

observers brieß y with objects in the form of 

line drawings or full-colour photographs, and 

these objects were 
presented in isolation or in 
context. Object 
recognition was much worse 

with the edge drawings than with the colour 

photographs, 
especially when objects were 
presented in 
context. Thus, Biederman (1987) 

exaggerated the role of edge-based extraction 

processes in object recognition.
Look back at Figure 3.6. It shows that 
recognition-by-components theory strongly 

emphasises bottom-up processes. Information 

extracted from the visual stimulus is used to 

construct a geon-based representation that is 

then compared against object representations 

stored in long-term memory. According to the 

theory, top-down processes depending on fac-

tors such as expectation and knowledge do not 

inß
 uence the early stages of object recognition. 
In fact, however, top-down processes are often 

very important (see Bar et al., 2006, for a 
review). For example, Palmer (1975) presented 

a picture of a scene (e.g., a kitchen) followed 

by the very brief presentation of the picture of 

an object. This object was either appropriate 

to the context (e.g., a loaf) or inappropriate 

(e.g., a mailbox or drum). There was also a 

further condition in which no contextual scene 

was presented. The probability of identifying 

the object correctly was greatest when the object 

was appropriate to the context, intermediate 

with no context, and lowest when the object 

was contextually inappropriate.

tify objects in spite of substantial differences

ze, and orientation"

assumption that geons or geon-like compon-

ents are involved in visual object recognition 

seems plausible. In addition, there is evidence 

that the identiÞ cation of concavities and edges 

is of major importance in object recognition.
BiedermanÕs theoretical approach possesses  
various limitations. First, the theory focuses 

primarily on bottom-up processes triggered 

directly by the stimulus input. By so doing, it 

de-emphasises the importance of top-down 

processes based on expectations and knowledge. 

This important limitation is absent from several 

recent theories (e.g., Bar, 2003; Lamme, 2003).
Second, it only accounts for fairly unsubtle 
perceptual discriminations. Thus, it explains 

how we decide whether the animal in front of us  

is a dog or cat, but not how we decide whether 

it is 
our
 dog or cat. We can easily make discrimi-

nations 
within
 categories such as identifying 
individual faces, but Biederman, Subramaniam, 

Bar, Kalocsai, and Fiser (1999) admitted that his 

theory is not applicable to face recognition.
Third, it is assumed within recognition-
by-components theory that object recognition 

generally involves matching an object-centred 

representation

of the observerÕs 
viewpoint with object information stored

clouds) are so variable that they do not have 

identiÞ able geons.
Viewpoint-dependent vs. 
viewpoint-invariant approaches
We have discussed BiedermanÕs (1987) viewpoint-
invariant theory, according to which ease of 

object recognition is unaffected by the observerÕs 

viewpoint. In contrast, viewpoint-dependent 

theories (e.g., T

assume that changes in viewpoint reduce the 

speed and/or accuracy of object recognition. 

According to such theories, ÒObject represent-

ations are collections of views that depict the 

appearance of objects from speciÞ
 c viewpointsÓ  
(T

object recognition is easier when an observerÕs 

view of an object corresponds to one of the 

stored views of that object.
Object recognition is sometimes viewpoint-
dependent and sometimes viewpoint-invariant. 

According to T

invariant mechanisms are typically used 

when object recognition involves making 

easy cat egorical discriminations (e.g., between 

cars and 
bicycles). In contrast, viewpoint-

dependent 
mechanisms are more important 
when the task 
requires difÞ
 cult within-category  
discriminations 
(e.g., between different makes 
of car).
Evidence consistent with the above general 
approach was reported by Tarr, Williams, 

Hayward, and Gauthier (1998). They considered 

recognition of the same three-dimensional objects 

under various conditions across nine experi-

ments.

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
Blais, Arguin, and Marleau (2009) argued 
that some kinds of visual information about 
objects are processed in the same way, regard-

less of rotation. In contrast, the processing of 

other kinds of visual information does depend 

on rotation. They obtained support for that 

argument in studies on visual search. Some 

visual processing (e.g., conjunctions of features) 

was viewpoint-invariant, whereas other visual 

processing (e.g., depth processing) was viewpoint-

dependent.
Some theorists (e.g., Foster & Gilson, 
2002; Hayward, 2003) argue that viewpoint-

dependent and viewpoint-invariant informa-

tion are combined co-operatively to produce 

object recognition. Supporting evidence was 

reported by Foster and Gilson (2002). Observers 

saw pairs of simple three-dimensional objects 

constructed from connected cylinders (see 

Figure 3.12), and decided whether the two 

images showed the same object or two different 

ones. When two objects were different, they 

could differ in a viewpoint-invariant feature 

(i.e., number of parts) and /or various viewpoint-

dependent features (e.g., part length, angle 

of join between parts). The key Þ
 nding was 
that observers used both kinds of information 

together. This suggests that we make use of 
all
 

available information in object recognition.

all
 

the available information (whether viewpoint-

dependent or viewpoint-invariant) is used in 

parallel to facilitate object recognition has 

received some support.
Most of the evidence suggesting that object 
recognition is viewpoint-dependent is rather 

indirect. For example, it has sometimes been 

found that the time required to identify two 

objects as the same increases as the amount of 

rotation of the object increases (e.g., Biederman 

& Gerhardstein, 1993). All that really shows 

is that 
some
 process is performed more slowly 

when the angle of rotation is greater (Blais 

et al., 2009). That process may occur early in 

visual processing. If so, the increased reaction 

time might be of little or no relevance to the 

theoretical controversy between viewpoint-

dependent and viewpoint-invariant theories. 

In the next section, we consider an alternative 

approach to object recognition based on cognitive 

neuroscience.

APPROACH TO OBJECT 

RECOGNITION
In recent years, there has been remarkable 
progress in understanding the brain processes 

involved in object recognition. This is all the 

more impressive given their enormous com-

plexity. Consider, for example, our apparently 

effortless ability to recognise Robert de Niro 

when we see him in a Þ
 lm. It actually involves 
numerous interacting processes at all levels 

from the retina through to the higher-level 

visual areas in the brain.
As we saw in Chapter 2, the ventral visual 
pathway is hierarchically organised. Visual 

processing basically proceeds from the retina,

through several areas including the lateral 
geniculate nucleus V1, V2, and V4, culminating 

in the inferotemporal cortex (see Figure 2.4). 

The stimuli causing the greatest neuronal 

activation become progressively more complex 

as processing moves along the ventral stream. 

At the same time, the receptive Þelds of cells 

increase progressively in size. Note that most 

researchers assume that the ventral pathway is 

specialised for object recognition, whereas the 

dorsal pathway is specialised for spatial vision 

and visually guided actions (e.g., Milner & 

Goodale, 2008; see Chapter 2).
Inferotemporal cortex (especially its ante-
rior portion) is of crucial importance in visual 

object recognition (Peissig & Tarr, 2007). Suppose 

we assess neuronal activity in inferotemporal 

cortex while participants are presented with 

several different objects, each presented at 

various angles, sizes, and so on. There are two 

key dimensions of neuronal responses in such 

a situation: 
selectivity
 and 
invariance
 or tolerance 

(Ison & Quiroga, 2008). Neurons responding 

strongly to one visual object but weakly (or not 

at all) to other objects possess high selectivity. 

Neurons responding almost equally strongly 

to a given object regardless of its orientation, 

size, and so on possess high invariance or 

tolerance.
We need to be careful when relating evidence 
about neuronal selectivity and tolerance to the 

theories of object recognition discussed earlier 

in the chapter. In general terms, however, 

inferotemporal neurons having high invariance 

or tolerance seem consistent with theories 

claiming that object recognition is viewpoint-

invariant. In similar fashion, inferotemporal 

neurons having low invariance appear to Þ

When we move on to discuss the relevant 
evidence, you will notice that the great majority  

of studies have used monkeys. This has been 

done because the invasive techniques involved 

can only be used on non-human species. It is 

generally (but perhaps incorrectly) assumed 

that basic visual processes are similar in humans 

and monkeys.
Evidence
Evidence that inferotemporal cortex is espe-

cially important in object recognition was 

provided by Leopold and Logothetis (1999) 

and Blake and Logothetis (2002). Macaque 

monkeys were presented with a different visual  

stimulus to each eye and trained to indicate 

which stimulus they perceived. This is known 

as binocular rivalry (see Glossary). The key 

Þ
 nding was that the correlation between neural 
activity and the monkeyÕs perception was 

greater at later stages of visual processing. 

For example, the activation of only 20% of 

neurons in V1 was associated with perception, 

whereas it was 90% in higher visual areas 

such as inferotemporal cortex and the superior 

temporal sulcus.
The above Þ ndings reveal an 
association
 
between neuronal activation in inferotemporal 

cortex and perception, but this falls short of 

demonstrating a 
causal 
relationship. This gap 
was Þ lled by Afraz, Kiani, and Esteky (2006). 

They trained two macaque monkeys to decide 

whether degraded visual stimuli were faces 

or non-faces. On some trials, the experimenters 

applied microstimulation to face-selective 

neurons within the inferotemporal cortex. This 

microstimulation caused the monkeys to make 

many more face decisions than when it was 

not applied. Thus, this study shows a causal 

relationship between activity of face-selective 

neurons in inferotemporal cortex and face 

perception.
We turn now to the important issue of 
neuronal selectivity and intolerance in object 

recognition. There is greater evidence of

the fusiform face area (see Figure 3.19 below) 
has often been identiÞ ed as a crucial area for 

face recognition (discussed more fully later). 

However, Grill-Spector, Sayres, and Ress (2006) 

found that small parts of that area responded 

mostly to animals, cars, or sculptures rather 

than faces.
The above evidence relates to regions 
rather than individual neurons. However, Tsao, 

Freiwald, Tootell, and Livingstone (2006) studied 

neurons within face-responsive regions of the 

superior temporal sulcus in macaque monkeys. 

The key Þ nding was that 97% of the visually 

responsive neurons responded strongly to faces 

but not other objects. This indicates that neurons 

can exhibit strong object speciÞ
 city (at least for  
faces).
Striking Þ ndings were reported by Quiroga, 
Reddy, Kreiman, Koch, and Fried (2005). They 

found a neuron in the medial temporal lobe 

that responded strongly to pictures of Jennifer 

Aniston (the actress from 
Friends
), but hardly 

responded to pictures of other famous faces 

or other objects. Surprisingly, this neuron did 

not respond to Jennifer Aniston with Brad 

Pitt! Other neurons responded speciÞ

or a famous building (e.g., Sydney Opera

only a single neuron in the medial temporal 

lobe responds to Jennifer Aniston. Note also 

that the neurons were in an area of the brain 

mostly concerned with memory and so these 

neurons are not just associated with visual 

processing.
Do neurons in the temporal cortex have high 
or low invariance? Some have high invariance 

and others have low invariance. Consider, for 

example, a study by Booth and Rolls (1998). 

Monkeys initially spent time playing with novel  

objects in their cages. After that, Booth and  

Rolls 
presented photographs of these objects 
taken fr
om different viewpoints while record-

ingneuronal activity in the superior temporal 

sulcus. They found that 49% of the neurons 
responded mostly to speciÞ c views and only 

14% produced viewpoint-invariant responses. 

However, the viewpoint-invariant neurons may 

be more important to object perception than 

their limited numbers might suggest. Booth 

and Rolls showed there was potentially enough 

information in the patterns of activation of 

these neurons to discriminate accurately among 

the objects presented.
What is the relationship between selectivity  
and invariance or tolerance in inferotemporal 

n eurons? The Þ rst systematic attempt to provide 

an answer was by Zoccolan, Kouh, Poggio, 

and DiCarlo (2007). There was a moderate 

negative
 correlation between object selectivity 

and tolerance. Thus, some neurons respond to 

many objects in several different sizes and 

orientations, whereas others respond mainly 

to a single object in a limited range of views. 

Why
 are selectivity and invariance negatively 

correlated? Perhaps our ability to perform 

visual tasks ranging from very precise object 

identiÞ
 cation to very broad categorisation of 
objects is facilitated by having neurons with

object selectivity at several stages of visual 

processing in both streams. In addition, there 

was increased invariance at higher levels of 

processing (e.g., posterior parietal cortex) than 

at intermediate ones (e.g., V4, MT). Overall, 

the Þ ndings suggested that object information

neurons are object-selective for giraffes. How-
ever, it is also possible that they are responding 

instead to an important feature of giraffes (i.e., 

their long necks) rather than to the object as 

a whole. Some neurons in the inferotemporal 

cortex of macaque monkeys respond to speciÞ
 c 
features of objects rather than the objects them-

selves (Sigala, 2004). The take-home message 

is that many of the neurons labelled Òobject-

selectiveÓ in other studies may actually be 

Òfeature-selectiveÓ.

There is convincing evidence that inferotemporal 

cortex is of major importance in object recogni-

tion. Some inferotemporal neurons exhibit high 

invariance, whereas others have low invariance.

Top-down processes in object recognition
Most cognitive neuroscientists (and cognitive 

psychologists) studying object recognition have 

focused on bottom-up processes as processing 

proceeds along the ventral pathway. However, 

top-down processes not directly involving the 

ventral pathway are also important. A crucial issue 

is whether top-down processes (probably involving 

the prefrontal cortex) occur 
prior
 to object 

recognition and are necessary for recognition 

or whether they occur 
after
 object recognition 

and relate to semantic processing of already 

recognised objects.
Bar et al. (2006) presented participants with 
drawings of objects presented brießy and then 

masked to make them hard to recognise. Activation 

in orbitofrontal cortex (part of the prefrontal 

cortex) occurred 50 ms before activation in 

recognition-related regions in the temporal 

cortex (see Figure 3.13).This orbitofrontal acti-

vation predicted successful object recognition, 
and so seemed to be important for recognition 

to occur. Bar et al. concluded that top-down 

processes in orbitofrontal cortex facilitate object 

recognition when recognition is difÞ cult.There 

was less involvement of orbito frontal cortex in 

object recognition when recognition was easy 

(longer, unmasked presentations).This makes 

sense Ð top-down processes are less important 

when detailed information is available to bottom-

up processes.
Stronger evidence that top-down processes 
in the prefrontal cortex play a direct role in object 

recognition was reported by Viggiano et al. (2008). 

They presented participants with

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
What are the limitations of research in this 
area? First, we must be cautious about gen-
eralising Þ ndings from monkeys to humans. 

However, some studies on humans (e.g., Konen 

& Kastner, 2008) have produced Þ
 ndings closely 
resembling those obtained from monkeys. 

Second, the research emphasis has been on the 

role of the ventral stream in object recognition. 

However, the dorsal stream may play a more 

active role in object recognition than generally 

assumed (Konen & Kastner, 2008). Third, 

it is often assumed that neurons responding 

only to certain objects are necessarily object-

selective. However, detailed experimentation 

is needed to distinguish between object-selective 

and feature-selective neurons (e.g., Sigala, 2004). 

Fourth, it has typically been assumed that the 
processes involved in object recognition pro-

ceed along the ventral stream from the retina 

through to the infero 
temporal cortex. This 
de-emphasises the role of top-down processes 

in object recognition (e.g., Bar et al., 2006; 

Viggiano et al., 2008).

Historically, a distinction was often made 
between two forms of visual agnosia:
Apperceptive agnosia

: object recognition

Associative agnosia

, object 
recognition is impaired because of

culties in accessing relevant knowledge 
about objects from memory.
How can we distinguish between appercep-
tive agnosia and associative agnosia? One way 

is to assess patientsÕ ability to copy objects they 

cannot recognise. Patients who can copy objects 

are said to have associative agnosia, whereas 

those who cannot have apperceptive agnosia. 

A test often used to assess apperceptive agnosia 

is the Gollin picture test. On this test, patients are 

presented with increasingly complete 
drawings  

of an object. Those with apperceptive agnosia 

require more drawings than healthy individuals 

to identify the objects.
The distinction between apperceptive and 
associative agnosia is oversimpliÞ
 ed. Patients 
suffering from various perceptual problems 

can all be categorised as having apperceptive 

agnosia. In addition, patients with apperceptive 

agnosia and associative agnosia have fairly 

general
 deÞ cits in object recognition. However, 

many patients with visual agnosia have relatively  

speciÞ
 c deÞ
 cits. For example, later in the chapter 
we discuss prosopagnosia, a condition involving 

speciÞ c
 problems in recognising faces.
Riddoch and Humphreys (2001; see also 
Humphreys & Riddoch, 2006) argued that 

the problems with visual object recognition ex-

accounted for by a hierarchical model of object

: the Þ
 nal stage involves
gaining access to stored knowledge relevant

to an object.
What predictions follow from this model?
The most obvious one is that we might expect 

to Þ
nd different patients with visual agnosia
 
having object-recognition problems at each of 

these stages of processing. That would show very 

clearly the limitations in distinguishing only 

between apperceptive and associative agnosia.
Evidence
In our discussion of the evidence, we will 

follow Riddoch and Humpreys (2001) in con-

sidering each stage in the model in turn. Many 

patients have problems with edge grouping or 

form perception. For example, Milner et al. 

(1991) studied a patient, DF, who had very 

severely impaired object recognition (this 

patient is discussed in detail in Chapter 2). She 

recognised only a few real objects and could not 

recognise any objects shown in line drawings. 

She also had poor performance when making 

judgements about simple patterns grouped on 

the basis of various properties (e.g., collinearity, 

proximity). Other patients have shown similar 

problems with edge grouping (see Riddoch & 

Humphreys, 2001).

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
Humphreys (1999) discussed what he termed 
integrative agnosia
, a condition in which the 
patient experiences great difÞ culty in integrating 

or combining an objectÕs features during object 

recognition. Humphreys and Riddoch (1987) 

studied HJA. He produced accurate drawings 

of objects he could not recognise"

itvery hard to integrate visual information. 

In his own words, ÒI have come to cope with 

recognising many common objects, if they are 

standing alone. When objects are placed together,  

though, I have more difÞ culties. To recognise 

one sausage on its own is far from picking 

one out from a dish of cold foods in a saladÓ 

(Humphreys & Riddoch, 1987).
Giersch, Humphreys, Boucart, and Kovacs 
(2000) presented HJA with an array of three 

geometric shapes that were spatially separated, 
superimposed, or occluded (covered) (see Fig-

ure 3.16). Then, a second array was presented, 

which was either the original array or a distractor 

array in which the positions of the shapes had 

been re-arranged. HJA performed reasonably 

well in deciding whether the two arrays were 

the same with separated shapes but not with 

superimposed or occluded shapes. Thus, HJA 

has poor ability for shape segregation.

Behrmann et al. concluded that separate mech-

anisms are involved in identifying the shapes 

of individual parts of objects and in perceiving 

the spatial arrangements of those parts. SM 

has much more severe problems with the latter 

mechanism than the former one.
Riddoch, Humphreys, Akhtar, Allen, Brace-
well, and ScholÞ
 eld (2008) compared two 
patients, one of whom (SA) has problems with 

edge grouping (form agnosia) and the other of 

whom (HJA) has integrative agnosia. Even 

though both patients have apperceptive agno-

sia, there are important differences between 

them. SA was worse than HJA at some aspects 

of early visual processing (e.g., contour tracing) 

but was better than HJA at recognising familiar 

objects. SA has inferior bottom-up processes 

to HJA but is better able to use top-down 
processes for visual object recognition. The 

problems that integrative agnosics have with 

integrating information about the parts of 

objects may depend in part on their limited 

top-down processing abilities. The fact that the 

areas of brain damage were different in the 

two patients (dorsal lesions in SA versus more 

ventral medial lesions in HJA) is also consistent 

with the notion that there are at least two types 

of apperceptive agnosia.
One way of determining whether a given 
patient can produce structural descriptions of 

objects is to give him/her an object-decision 

task. On this task, patients are presented with 

pictures or drawings of objects and non-

objects, and decide which are the real objects. 

Some patients perform well on object-decision 

tasks but nevertheless have severe problems 

with object recognition. Fery and Morais 

(2003) studied DJ, who has associative agnosia.

semantic knowledge about objects. However, 

he performed well on tasks involving shape 

processing, integration of parts, and copying 

and matching objects. For example, DJ was 

correct on 93% of trials on a difÞ
 cult animal-
decision task in which the non-animals were 

actual animals with one part added, deleted, 

or substituted (see Figure 3.17). This indicates 

that several of the processes relating to object 

recognition are essentially intact in DJ.
Finally, some patients have severe problems  
with object recognition because they have damage 

to the semantic memory system containing 

information about objects. Patients whose object-

recognition difÞ
 culties depend 
only
 on dam-
aged semantic memory are not regarded as 

visual agnosics because their visual processes 

are essentially intact (see Chapter 7). However, 

some visual agnosics have partial damage to 

semantic memory. Peru and Avesani (2008) 

studied FB, a woman who suffered damage to 

the right frontal region and the left posterior 

temporal lobe as the result of a skiing accident.

Evaluation
The hierarchical model put forward by Riddoch 

and Humphreys (2001) provides a useful 

framework within which to discuss the problems 

with object recognition shown by visual agnosics. 

The evidence from brain-damaged patients is 

broadly consistent with the modelÕs predictions. 

What is very clear is that the model represents 

a marked improvement on the simplistic dis-

tinction between apperceptive and associative 

agnosia.
What are the limitations of the hierarchical 
model? First, it is based largely on the assump-

tion that object recognition occurs primarily 

in a bottom-up way. In fact, however, top-down 

processes are also important, with processes 

associated with later stages inß
 uencing processing 
at early stages (e.g., Bar et al., 2006; Viggiano 

et al., 2008). Second, and related to the Þ
 rst 
point, the processing associated with object 

recognition may not proceed in the neat, 

stage-by-stage way envisaged within the model. 

Third, the model is more like a framework 

than a complete theory. For example, it is 

assumed that each stage of processing uses the 

output from the previous stage, but the details 

of how this is accomplished remain unclear.
FACE RECOGNITION
There are several reasons for devoting a separate 

section to face recognition. First, the ability to 

recognise faces is of huge signiÞ cance in our 

everyday lives. As you may have found to your 

cost, people are offended if you fail to recognise 

them. In certain circumstances, it can be a 

matter of life or death to recognise whether 

someone is a friend or enemy. It is signiÞ
 cant 
that robbers try to conceal their identity by 

covering their faces. In addition, it is important 

to be able to recognise the expressions on

other peopleÕs faces to judge your impact on 
them.
Second, face recognition differs in important 
ways from other forms of object recognition. 

As a result, theories of object recognition are of  

only limited value in explaining face recognition, 

and theories speciÞ
 cally devoted to accounting 
for face recognition are needed.
Third, we now have a reasonably good 
understanding of the processes involved in face 

recognition. One reason for this is the diversity 

of research Ð it includes behavioural studies, 

studies on brain-damaged patients, and neuro-

imaging studies.
How does face recognition differ from the 
recognition of other objects? An important part 

of the answer is that face recognition involves 

more 
holistic
 
processing
 or conÞ
 gural process-
ing (processing involving strong integration 

across the whole object). Information about 

speciÞ
 c features of a face can be unreliable 
because different individuals share similar 

facial features (e.g., eye colour) or because an 

individualÕs features are subject to change (e.g., 

skin shade, mouth shape). In view of the unreli-

ability of feature information, it is desirable 

for us to use holistic or conÞ
 gural processing 
of faces.
Evidence that holistic processing is used 
much more often with faces than other objects 

comes from studies on the inversion, partÐ

whole, and composite effects (see McKone, 

Kanwisher, & Duchaine, 2007, for a review). 

In the 
inversion effect
, faces are much harder 

to identify when presented inverted or upside-

down rather than upright. McKone (2004) 

asked participants to decide which of two faces 

had been presented brieß
 y to them centrally or 
at various locations toward"
Segment_181,"s the periphery of   vision. IdentiÞ  cation accuracy was consistently  much higher when the faces were presented   upright rather than inverted. In contrast, adverse   effects of inversion on object recognition are   much smaller with non-face objects and generally   disappear rapidly with practice",Explores how perception influences cognition.,"attention, recognition, emotion",Nested under Chapter on recognition,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in recognition,Aligned with contemporary studies on emotion,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_955,"s the periphery of 

vision. IdentiÞ
 cation accuracy was consistently 
much higher when the faces were presented 

upright rather than inverted. In contrast, adverse 

effects of inversion on object recognition are 

much smaller with non-face objects and generally 

disappear rapidly with practice (see McKone, 

2004, for a review).
The inversion effect does not assess holistic 
processing directly, unlike the partÐwhole and 
composite effects. In the 
part
Ð
whole effect
, 

memory for a face part is more accurate when 

it is presented within the whole face rather 

than on its own. Farah (1994) studied this 

effect. Participants were presented with draw-

ings of faces or houses, and associated a name 

with each face and each house. After that, they 

were presented with whole faces and houses 

or with only a single feature (e.g., mouth, front 

door). Recognition performance for face parts 

was much better when the whole face was 

presented rather than only a single feature (see 

Figure 3.18). This is the partÐwhole effect. In 

contrast, recognition performance for house 

features was very similar in whole- and single-

feature conditions.
The partÐwhole effect indicates that faces 
are stored in 
memory
 in holistic form, but does 

not directly show that faces are 
perceived
 
holistically. Farah, Wilson, Drain, and Tanaka 

(1998) Þ lled this gap. 
Participants were pre-

sented with a face followed 
by a mask and then 
a second face, and decided whether the second 

face was the same as the Þ rst. The mask consisted 

of a face arranged randomly or of a whole face. 

Face-recognition performance was better when 

part masks were used rather than whole masks, 

presumably because the Þ rst face was processed 

as a whole. With house or word stimuli, the 

beneÞ
 cial effects of part masks over whole 
masks were much less than with faces.

perception of only one half face is impaired 
when the half faces are aligned compared to 

when they are unaligned (e.g., Young, Hellawell,  

& Hay, 1987). 
The composite effect is typically 
not
 found with inverted faces or with non-face 

objects (see McKone et al., 2007, for a review).
Evaluation
The inversion, partÐwhole, and composite 

effects all provide evidence that faces are subject 

to holistic or conÞ gural processing. Of impor-

tance, all these effects are generally absent in 

the processing of non-face objects. Thus, there 

are major differences between face and object 

recognition. However, the inversion effect does 

not provide a direct assessment of holistic pro-

cessing, and so provides weaker evidence than 

the other effects that face processing is holistic. 

Most people have much more experience at 

processing faces than other objects and have 

thus developed special expertise in face process-

ing (Gauthier & Tarr, 2002). It is thus possible 

that holistic or conÞ gural processing is found 

for any category of objects for which an indi-

vidual possesses expertise. That would mean 

that there is nothing special about faces. As 

we will see later, most of the 
evidence fails to 

support this alternative 
explanation.

3 OBJECT 
AND FACE RECOGNITION 
103
Prosopagnosia
If face processing differs substantially from object 
processing, we might expect to Þ nd some brain-

damaged individuals with severely impaired 

face processing but not object processing. Such 

individuals exist. They suffer from a condition 

known as 
prosopagnosia
, coming from the Greek 

words meaning ÒfaceÓ and Òwithout knowledgeÓ. 

Patients with prosopagnosia (Òface-blindnessÓ) 

can generally recognise most objects reasonably 

well in spite of their enormous problems with 

faces. JK, a woman in her early thirties, described 

an embarrassing incident caused by her pros-

opagnosia: ÒI went to the wrong baby at my 

sonÕs daycare and only realised that he was not 

my son when the entire daycare staff looked 

at me in horriÞ ed disbeliefÓ (Duchaine & 

Nakayama, 2006, p. 166).
In spite of their poor conscious recognition 
of faces, prosopagnosics often show evidence 

of covert recognition (i.e., processing of faces 

without conscious awareness). In one study, 

prosopagnosics decided rapidly whether names 

were familiar or unfamiliar (Young, Hellawell, 

& de Haan, 1988). They performed the task more 

rapidly when presented with a related priming 

face immediately before the target name, even 

though they could not recognise the face at the 

conscious level. Covert recognition can some-

times be turned into overt or conscious rec"
Segment_184,"ognition   if the task is very easy. In one study,  prosopag- nosics showed evidence of overt  recognition   when several faces were presented and they were   informed that all belonged to  the same category    (Morrison, Bruce, and  Burton,  2003).

if the task is very easy. In one study, 
prosopag-
nosics showed evidence of overt 
recognition 

when several faces were presented and they were 

informed that all belonged to 
the same category  

(Morrison, Bruce, and 
Burton, 
2003).
There are three points to bear in mind 
before discussing the evidence. First, prosopag-

nosia is a heterogeneous or diverse condition 

in which the precise problems of face and 

object recognition vary from patient to patient. 

Second, the origins of the condition also vary. 

In acquired prosopagnosia, the condition is 

due to brain damage. In contrast, developmental 

prosopagnosics have no obvious brain damage 

but never acquire the ability to recognise faces. 

Third, there are various reasons why prosopag-

nosics Þ nd it much harder to recognise faces 

than objects. The obvious explanation is that 
acquired prosopagnosics have suffered damage 

to a part of the brain specialised for processing 

faces. However, an alternative interpretation 

is that face recognition is simply much harder 

than object recognition Ð face recognition 
involves 
distinguishing among members of 
the same 
category (i.e., faces), whereas object recognition  

generally only involves identifying the category 

to which an object belongs (e.g., cat, car).
Strong support for the notion that face 
recognition involves different processes from 

object recognition would come from the demon-

stration of a double dissociation (see Glossary).  

In this double dissociation, some prosopagnosics 

would show severely impaired face recognition 

but intact object recognition, whereas other 

patients would show the opposite pattern. 

Convincing evidence that some prosopagnosics 

have intact object recognition was reported b y 

Duchaine and Nakayama (2005). They 
tested 
seven developmental prosopagnosics on 
various  
tasks involving memory for faces, cars, tools, 

guns, horses, houses, and natural landscapes.

with two PhDs. He did very poorly on several 

tests of face memory. Indeed, he performed no 

better with upright faces than with inverted ones, 

suggesting he could not engage in holistic face 

processing. In contrast, he performed slightly

most developmental prosopagnosics have voxels
 
(very small three-dimensional volume elements) 
that respond more strongly to faces than to objects, 

but none was found in EdwardÕs brain.
The opposite pattern of intact object 
recognition but impaired face recognition has 

also been reported. Moscovitch, Winocur, and 

B ehrmann (1997) studied CK, a man with object

ation is most readily explained by assuming that  

different processes (and brain areas) underlie 

face and object recognition.
Fusiform face area
If faces are processed differently to other objects,  

we would expect to Þ nd brain regions speci-

alised for face processing. The fusiform face area 

in the lateral fusiform gyrus (see Figure 3.19) 

has (as its name strongly implies!) been identiÞ
 ed 
as such a brain region (see Kanwisher & Yovel, 

2006, for a review). One reason is that this area i s  

frequently damaged in patients with acquired 
pro-

sopagnosia (Barton, Press, Keenan, & OÕConnor, 

2002). In addition, 
there is substantial support 
for the importance of the fusiform face area in 

face processing from brain-imaging studies: this 

area typically responds at least twice as strongly  

to faces as to other objects 
(McKone et al., 2007). 
Downing, Chan, 
Peelen, Dodds, and Kanwisher 
(2006) presentedpartic

more strongly to faces than to any

category. In a study discussed 

earlier, Tsao et al. (2006) 
identiÞ ed a region 

within the monkey equivalent 
of the fusiform 
face area in which 97% of visually responsive 

neurons responded much more strongly to 

faces than to objects (e.g., fruits, gadgets).

responding in the fusiform face area was three 
times stronger to faces than to houses.
In spite of strong evidence that the fusiform 
face area is much involved in face processing, 

three points need to be made. First, the fusiform 

face area is not the 
only
 brain area involved in 
face processing. Other face-selective areas are 

the occipital face area and the superior 
tem-

poral sulcus. Rossion, Caldara, Seghier, Schuller, 

Lazayras, and Mayer (2003) considered a proso-

pagnosic patient, PS. Her right fusiform face 

area was intact, but she had damage to the 

occipital face area. Rossion et al. suggested that 

normal face processing depends on integrated 

functioning of the right fusiform face area 

and
 the right occipital face area. The superior 

temporal sulcus is sometimes activated during 

processing of changeable aspects of faces (e.g., 

expression) (see Haxby, Hoffman, & Gobbini, 

2000, for a review).
Second, the fusiform face area is more com-
plicated than generally assumed. Grill-Spector 

et al. (2006) in a study discussed earlier found, 

using high-resolution fMRI, that the fusiform 

face area has a diverse structure. Observers saw  

faces and three categories of object (animals, 

cars, and abstract sculptures). More high-

resolution 
voxels 
(small volume elements in the  
brain) in the fusiform face area were selective 

to faces than to any of the object categories. 

However, the differences were not dramatic. 

The average number of voxels selective to faces 
was 155 compared to 104 (animals), 63 (cars), 

and 63 (sculptures). As"
Segment_188,"Grill-Spector et al.   (p. 1183) concluded, ÒThe results challenge the   prevailing hypothesis that the FFA (fusiform   face area) is a uniform brain area in which all   neurons are face-selective.Ó Third, there has been a major theoretical con- troversy concerning the Þ nding that the fusiform   f",Explores how recognition influences cognition.,"memory, emotion, awareness",Nested under Chapter on awareness,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in memory,Aligned with contemporary studies on attention,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_784," Grill-Spector et al. 

(p. 1183) concluded, ÒThe results challenge the 

prevailing hypothesis that the FFA (fusiform 

face area) is a uniform brain area in which all 

neurons are face-selective.Ó
Third, there has been a major theoretical con-
troversy concerning the Þ nding that the fusiform 

face area is face-selective. Gauthier and Tarr 

(2002) assumed we have much more expertise  

in recognising faces than individual members 

of other categories. They argued that the brain 

mechanisms claimed to be speciÞ
 c to faces are 
also involved in recognising the members of 
any
 
object category for which we possess expertise. 

This issue is discussed at length below.
Are faces special?
According to Gauthier and Tarr (2002), many 

Þ
 ndings pointing to major differences between 
face and object processing should not be taken 

at face value (sorry!). According to them (as 

mentioned above), it is of crucial importance 

that most people have far more expertise in

when observers recognise the members of 
any
 

category for which they possess expertise. 

Third, prosopagnosics have damage to brain 

areas specialised for processing of objects for 

which they possess expertise. Accordingly, their 

ability to recognise non-face objects of expertise 

should be impaired.
So far as the Þ rst prediction is concerned, 
Gauthier and Tarr (2002) found supporting 

evidence in a study (discussed earlier) in which 

participants spent several hours learning to 

identify families of artificial objects called 

Greebles (see Figure 3.7). There was a progressive 

increase in sensitivity to conÞ gural changes in 

Greebles as a function of developing expertise. 

However, these Þ ndings are discrepant with 

most other research. McKone et al. (2007) 

reviewed studies on the inßuence of expertise 

for non-face objects on the inversion, partÐ

whole, and composite effects discussed earlier, 

all of which are assumed to require holistic or 

conÞ
 gural processing. Expertise typically failed  
to lead to any of these effects.
So far as the second hypothesis is concerned, 
Gauthier, Behrmann, and Tarr (1999) gave parti-

cipants several hoursÕ practice in recognising 

Greebles. The fusiform face area was activated 

when participants recognised Greebles, especially 

as their expertise with Greebles increased. 

Gauthier, Skudlarski, Gore, and Anderson (2000) 

assessed activation of the fusiform face area 

during recognition tasks involving faces, familiar  

objects, birds, and cars. Some particip ants were 

experts on birds, and the others were experts 

on cars. Expertise inß uenced activation of the 

fusiform face area: there was more activ 
ation 
to cars when recognised by car experts than 

by bird experts, and to birds when recognised 
by bird experts than by car experts. While it 

appears that expertise directly inß
 uenced acti-
vation in the fusiform face area, it is possible 

that experts simpl"

(2007) reviewed eight studies  testing the hypothesis that the fusiform face   area is more activated by objects of expertise   than by other objects.

objects relating to their expertise.
McKone et al. (2007) reviewed eight studies 
testing the hypothesis that the fusiform face 

area is more activated by objects of expertise 

than by other objects. Three studies reported 

small but signiÞ cant effects of expertise, 

whereas the effects were non-signiÞ
 cant in the 
others. Five studies considered whether any 

expertise effects are greatest in the fusiform 

face area. Larger effects were reported 
outside
 

the fusiform face area than 
inside
 it (McKone 

et al., 2007). Finally, there are a few recent studies 

(e.g., Yue, Tjan, & Biederman 2006) in which 

participants received extensive training to dis-

criminate be 
tween exemplars of novel categories 
of stimuli. 
Against the expertise theory, activation 
in the fusiform face area was no greater for 

trained than for untrained categories.
According to the third hypothesis, pro-
sopagnosics should have impaired ability to 

recognise the members of non-face categories 

for which they possess expertise. Some Þ
 ndings 
are inconsistent with this hypothesis. Sergent 

and Signoret (1992) studied a prosopagnosic, 

RM, who had expertise for cars. He had very 

poor face recognition but recognised consider-

ably more makes, models and years of car than 

healthy controls. Another prosopagnosic, WJ, 

acquired a ß ock of sheep. Two years later, his 

ability to recognise individual sheep was as good 

as that of healthy controls with comparable 

knowledge of sheep.
Evaluation
As assumed by the expertise theory, most people 

possess much more expertise about faces than 

any other object category. It is also true that we  

have more experience of identifying individual 

faces than individual members of most other cate-

gories. However, none of the speciÞ
 c hypotheses 
of the expertise theory has been supported. Of 

crucial importance is recognition of objects 

belonging to categories for which the individual

theory, such objects should show the same effects 
associated with faces (i.e., conÞ
 gural processing; 
activation of the fusiform face area; impaired 

recognition in prosopagnosics). None of these 

effects has been obtained reliably. Instead, non-

face objects of expertise typically show the same 

effects as objects for which individuals have 

no expertise. Thus, faces have special and unique 

characteristics not shared by other objects.
Models of face recognition
We now turn to models of face recognition, 

most of which have emphasised the sheer vari-

ety of 
information we extract from faces. The 
model considered in most detail is that of Bruce 

and Young (1986). Why is that? It has been 

easily the most inß
 uential theoretical approach 
to face recognition. Indeed, most subsequent 

models incorporate many ideas taken from the 

Bruce and Young model.
The model consists of eight components 
(see Figure 3.20):
Structural encoding
(1) 
: this produces various 
representations or descriptions of faces.

Expression analysis
(2) 
: other peopleÕs emo-
tional states are inferred from their facial 

expression.

Facial speech analysis
(3) 
: speech perception 
is assisted by observing a speakerÕs lip 

movements (lip-reading Ð see Chapter 9).

Directed visual processing
(4) 
: speciÞ
 c facial 
information is processed selectively.
Face recognition nodes
(5) 
: these contain 
structural information about known faces.

Person identity nodes
(6) 
: these provide infor
-
mation about individuals (e.g., occupation, 

interests).

Name generation
(7) 
: a personÕs name is stored
 
separately.

Cognitive system
(8) 
: this contains additional 
information (e.g., most actors and actresses
 
have attractive faces); it inß
 uences which 
other components receive attention.

In contrast, the processing of unfamiliar faces

Second, consider the processing of facial 
identity (who is the person?) and the processing 

of facial expression (e.g., what is he / she feeling?). 

According to the model, 
separate
 processing 

routes are involved in the two cases, with the 

key component for processing facial expression 

being the expression analysis component.
Third, when we look at a familiar face, 
familiarity information from the face recognition 

unit should be accessed Þ rst, followed by infor-

from the person identity node, followed by 
that personÕs name from the name generation 

component. Thus, familiarity decisions about 

a face should be made faster than decisions 

based on person identity nodes, and the latter 

decisions should be made faster than decisions 

concerning the individualÕs name.
If you found it a struggle to come to grips 
with the complexities of the Bruce and Young 

(1986) model, help is at hand. Duchaine and 

Nakayama (2006) have provided a modiÞ
 ed 
version of that model including an additional 

face-detection stage (see F"
Segment_193,"igure 3.21). At this   initial stage, observers decide whether the stimulus   they are looking at is a face. Duchaine (2006),   in a study discussed  earlier, found that a prosopag- nosic called Edward  detected faces as rapidly  as healthy controls in  spite of his generally very    poor face recog",Explores how memory influences cognition.,"attention, perception, emotion",Nested under Chapter on emotion,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in memory,Aligned with contemporary studies on awareness,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_146,"igure 3.21). At this 

initial stage, observers decide whether the stimulus 

they are looking at is a face. Duchaine (2006), 

in a study discussed 
earlier, found that a prosopag-
nosic called Edward 
detected faces as rapidly 
as healthy controls in 
spite of his generally very  

poor face recognition.
Evidence
It is self-evident that the processing of familiar 

faces differs from that of unfamiliar ones, because 

we only have access to relevant stored knowledge 

(e.g., name, occupation) with familiar faces. 

If the two types of face are processed very 

differently, we might Þ nd a double dissociation 

in which some patients have good recognition 

for familiar faces but poor recognition for 

unfamiliar faces, whereas other patients show 

the opposite pattern. Malone, Morris, Kay, and 

Levin (1982) obtained this double dissociation. 

One patient recognised the photographs of 82% 

of famous statesmen but was extremely poor 

at matching unfamiliar faces. A second patient 

performed normally at matching unfamiliar 

faces but recognised the photographs of only 23%  

of famous people. However, Young, Newcombe, 

de Haan, Small, and Hay (1993) reported less 

clear Þ ndings with 34 brain-damaged men. There 

was only weak evidence for selective impairment 

of either familiar or unfamiliar face recognition.
Much research supports the assumption that  
separate routes are involved in the processing 

of facial identity and facial expression. Young 

et al. (1993) reported a double dissociation in 

which some patients showed good performance 

on face recognition but poor performance on 

identifying facial expression, whereas others 

showed the opposite pattern. Humphreys, Avidan, 

and Behrmann (2007) reported very clear Þ
 nd-
ings in three 
participants with developmental 

prosopagnosia. All 
three had poor ability to 
recognise faces, but their ability to recognise facial 

expressions (even the most subtle ones) was 

comparable to that of health"

impairments reß ect damage to emotion systems 
rather than to face-speciÞ
 c mechanisms.Ó
It has often been argued that different brain 
regions are involved in the processing of facial 

expressions and facial identity. Haxby et al. 

(2000) argued that the processing of change-

able aspects of faces (especially expressions) 

occurs mainly in the superior temporal sulcus. 

Other areas associated with emotion (e.g., the 

amygdala) are also involved in the processing of  

facial expression. The evidence provides modest 

support for this theory. Winston, Vuilleumier, 

and Dolan (2003) found that repeating facial 

identity
 across face pairs affected activation within 

the fusiform face area, whereas repeating facial 

expression
 affected an area within the superior 

temporal sulcus not inß uenced by repeated facial 

identity. In general, however, the evidence much 

more consistently implicates the fusiform face 

area in processing of facial identity than the

Calder, Young, Keane, and Dean (2000)

The same person posing two different

Two different people posing the same

Two different people posing different 
(3) 
facial expressions.
The participantsÕ task was to decide rapidly the 

facial identity or the facial expression of the 

person shown in the bottom half of the com-

posite picture.
What would we predict if 
different
 processes 
are involved in recognition of facial identity 

and facial expression? Consider the task of 

deciding on the facial expression of the face 

shown in the bottom half. Performance should 

be slower when the facial expression is differ-

ent in the top half, but there should be 
no
 

additional cost when the two halves also differ 

in facial identity. In similar fashion, facial 

identity decisions should not be slower when 
the facial expressions differ in the two face 

halves. The predicted Þ ndings were obtained 

(see Figure 3.22).
According to the Bruce and Young (1986) 
model, when we look at a familiar face we Þ
 rst 
access familiarity information, followed by 

personal information (e.g., the personÕs occu-

pation), followed by the personÕs name. As 

predicted, Young, McWeeny, Hay, and Ellis 

(1986) found thedecis
ion as to whether a face 
was familiar was made faster than the decision 

as to whether it was a politicianÕs face. Kampf, 

Nachson, and Babkoff (2002) found as pre-

dicted that 
participants categorised familiar 

faces with 
respect to occupation faster than 
they could name the same faces.
The Bruce and Young model assumes that 
the name generation component can be accessed 

only 
via the appropriate person identity node.

Thus, we should never be able to put a name 
to a face without also having available other 

information about that person (e.g., his / her 

occupation). Young, Hay, and Ellis (1985) asked 

people to keep a diary record of problems they 

experienced in face recognition. There were 1008  

incidents in total, but people 
never 
reported 
putting a name to a face while knowing nothing 

else about that person. If the appropriate 

face recognition unit is activated but the person 

identity node is not, there should be a feeling 

of familiarity but an inability to think of any 

relevant information about that person. In the 

incidents collected by Young et al., this was 

reported on 233 occasions.
Most published studies comparing speed 
of recall of personal information and names 

have focused exclusively on famous faces. As 

Br”dart, Brennen, Delchambre, McNeill, and 

Burton (2005) pointed out, we name 
famous 

faces less often than our personal friends 
and 
acquaintances. If the frequency with which we 

use peopleÕs names inß
 uences the speed with 
which we can recall them, Þ ndings with faces 

with which we are personally familiar might 

differ from those obtained with famous faces. 

Br”dart et al. presented members of a Cognitive

times taken to provide the person information 

about educational level (832 ms versus 1033 ms,  

respectively), which is the opposite to the 
pre-
dictions of the model. The probable reason why 

these Þ ndings differed from those of previous 

researchers is because of the high frequency of 

exposure to the names of close colleagues.
Evaluation
Bruce and YoungÕs (1986) model has deservedly 

been highly inß uential. It identiÞ es the wide 

range of information that can be extracted 

from faces. The assumption that separate pro-

cessing routes are involved in the processing 

of facial identity and facial expression has 

received empirical support. Key differences in 
the processing of familiar and unfamiliar faces 

are identiÞ ed. Finally, as predicted by the model, 

the processing of familiar faces typically leads 

Þ
 rst to accessing of familiarity information, 
followed by personal information, and then 

Þ
 nally name information.
The model possesses various limitations, 
mostly due to the fact it is oversimpliÞ
 ed. First, 
the model omits the first stage of process-

ing, during which observers detect that they 

are looking at a face (Duchaine & Nakayama, 

2006).
Second, the assumption that facial identity 
and facial expression involve separate pro-

cessing routes may be too extreme (Calder & 

Young, 2005). The great majority of proso-

pagnosics have severe problems with processing 

facial expression as well as facial identity, and 

the two processing routes are probably only 

partially separate.
Third, patients with impaired processing 
of facial expression sometimes have much 

greater problems with one emotional category 

(e.g., fear, disgust) than others. This suggests 

there may not be a single system for facial 

expressions, and that the processing of facial 

expressions "
Segment_198,"involves emotional systems to a   greater extent than assumed by the model. Fourth, the assumption that the processing  of names always occurs after the processing   of other personal information about faces is   too rigid (Br”dart et al., 2005).

VISUAL IMAGERY
In this chapter (and Chapter 2), we have 

focused on the main processes involved in 

visual perception. We turn now to visual imagery, 

which Òoccurs when a visual short-term 

memory (STM) representation is present but 

the stimulus is not actually being viewed; visual 

imagery is accompanied by the experience 

of Ôseeing with the mindÕs eyeÕ Ó (Kosslyn & 

Thompson, 2003, p. 723). It is often assumed

that imagery and perception are very similar, 
which is probably consistent with your personal 

experience of imagery.
If visual imagery and perception are very 
similar, why donÕt we confuse images and 

perceptions? In fact, a few people show such 

confusions, suffering from hallucinations in 

which what is regarded as visual perception 

occurs in the absence of the appropriate 

environmental stimulus. Hallucinations are 

common in individuals with 
Charles Bonnet 

syndrome
, a condition associated with eye 

disease in which detailed visual hallucinations 

not under the patientÕs control are experienced. 

One sufferer reported the following hallucina-

tion: ÒThereÕs heads of 17th century men and 

women, with nice heads of hair. Wigs, I should 

think. Very disapproving, all of them. They 

never smileÓ (Santhouse, Howard, & ffytche, 

2000). ffytche found using fMRI that patients 

with Charles Bonnet syndrome had increased 

activity in brain areas specialised for visual 

processing when hallucinating. In addition,"
Segment_199,"hallucinations in colour were associated with   increased activity in brain areas specialised for   colour processing, hallucinations of faces were   related to increased activity in regions specialised   for face processing, and so on. Very few people experience hallucinations.  Indeed, anyone (",Explores how recognition influences cognition.,"memory, recognition, awareness",Nested under Chapter on emotion,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in memory,Aligned with contemporary studies on awareness,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_724," 

hallucinations in colour were associated with 

increased activity in brain areas specialised for 

colour processing, hallucinations of faces were 

related to increased activity in regions specialised 

for face processing, and so on.
Very few people experience hallucinations. 
Indeed, anyone (other than those with eye dis-

ease) suffering from numerous hallucinations 

is unlikely to remain at liberty for long! Why 

donÕt most of us confuse images with percep-

tions? One reason is that we are often aware 

that we have 
deliberately
 constructed images, 

which is not the case with perception. Another 

reason is that images typically contain much 

less detail than perception, as was reported by 

Harvey (1986). Participants rated their visual 

images of faces as most similar to photographs 

of the same faces from which the sharpness of 

the edges and borders had been removed.
Perceptual anticipation theory
Kosslyn (e.g., 1994, 2005) proposed an extremely 

inß
 uential approach to mental imagery. It is 
known as perceptual anticipation theory because 
the mechanisms used to generate images involve  

processes used to anticipate perceiving stimuli. 

Thus, the theory assumes there are close 

similarities between visual imagery and visual 

perception. Visual images are 
depictive repre-

sentations
 Ð they are like pictures or drawings in  

that the objects and parts of objects contained 

in them are arranged in space. More speciÞ
 cally, 
information within an image is organised 

spatially in the same way as information within 

a percept. Thus, for example, a visual image 

of a desk with a computer on top of it and a 

cat sleeping beneath it would be arranged so 

that the computer was at the top of the image 

and the cat at the bottom.
Where
 in the brain are these depictive 
representations formed? Kosslyn argues that 

such representations must be formed in a topo-

graphically organised brain area, meaning that 

the spatial organisation o"
Segment_200,"f brain activity resembles   that of the imagined object. According to Kosslyn   and Thompson (2003), depictive representations   are created in early visual cortex, which consists   of primary visual cortex (also known as BA17   or V1) and secondary visual cortex (also known   as BA18 or V2) (see F",Explores how awareness influences cognition.,"perception, emotion, recognition",Nested under Chapter on recognition,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in attention,Aligned with contemporary studies on emotion,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_657,"f brain activity resembles 

that of the imagined object. According to Kosslyn 

and Thompson (2003), depictive representations 

are created in early visual cortex, which consists 

of primary visual cortex (also known as BA17 

or V1) and secondary visual cortex (also known 

as BA18 or V2) (see Figure 3.23). They used 

the term 
visual buffer
 to refer to the brain areas 
i n which the depictive representations are formed, 

among which Areas 17 and 18 are of special 

importance. This visual buffer is used in visual 

perception as well as visual imagery; indeed, 

Areas 17 and 18 are of great importance in the 

early stages of visual processing. In perception, 

processing in the visual buffer depends primarily

on external stimulation. In contrast, visual 
images in the visual buffer depend on non-

pictorial, propositional information stored in 

long-term memory. Visual long-term memories 

of shapes are stored in the inferior temporal 

lobe, whereas spatial representations are stored 

in posterior parietal cortex (see Figure 3.23).
We can compare KosslynÕs perceptual antici-
pation theory against the propositional theory 

of Pylyshyn (e.g., 2002, 2003a). According to 

Pylyshyn, performance on mental imagery tasks 

does not involve depictive or pictorial represent-

ations. Instead, what is involved is tacit know-

ledge (knowledge not generally accessible to 

conscious awareness)"
Segment_201,". More speciÞ  cally, tacit  knowledge is Òknowledge of  what things would  look like  to subjects in situations like the   ones in which they are to imagine themselvesÓ   (Pylyshyn, 2002, p. 161). Thus, participants   given an imagery task base their performance   on relevant stored knowledge rathe",Explores how perception influences cognition.,"perception, awareness, attention",Nested under Chapter on perception,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in recognition,Aligned with contemporary studies on memory,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_1105,". More speciÞ

knowledge is Òknowledge of 
what things would 
look like
 to subjects in situations like the 

ones in which they are to imagine themselvesÓ 

(Pylyshyn, 2002, p. 161). Thus, participants 

given an imagery task base their performance 

on relevant stored knowledge rather than on 

visual images.
The exact nature of the tacit knowledge 
allegedly involved in visual imagery seems 

puzzling, because Pylyshyn has not provided 

a very explicit account. However, there is no 

reason within his theory to assume that early 

visual cortex would be involved when someone 

forms a visual image.
Imagery resembles perception
If visual perception and visual imagery depend 

on the same visual buffer, we would expect 

perception and imagery to inß uence each other. 

More speciÞ cally, there should be 
facilitative
 

effects if the content of the perception and the 

image is the same but
 interference
 effects if 

the content is different. As we will see, both 

predictions have been supported.
So far as facilitation is concerned, we will 
consider a study by Pearson, Clifford, and Tong 

(2008). Observers initially perceived or imagined 

a green vertical grating or a red horizontal 

grating. After that, they saw a visual display 

inwhich a green grating was presented to 

one eye and a red grating to the other eye at 

various orientations. When two different stim-

uli are presented one to each eye there is bin-

ocular rivalry (see Glossary), with only 
one
 of 

the stimuli being consciously perceived. There was  

a facilitation effect, in that under binocular 

rivalry conditions the stimulus originally perceived 

or imagined was more likely to be perceived. 

This facilitation effect was greatest when the 

orientation of the grating under binocular rivalry 

conditions was the same as the initial orientation  

and least when there was a large difference in 

orientation (sees Figure 3.24). Note that the 

pattern of Þ

was initially perceived or imagined. The overall 

Þ
 ndings suggest that visual imagery involves 
similar processes to visual perception. They 

also suggest that visual images contain detailed

 c information as predicted 
by perceptual anticipation theory.
Baddeley and Andrade (2000) obtained an 
interference effect. Participants rated the vivid-

ness of visual or auditory images under control 

conditions (no additional task) or while per-

forming a second task. This second task involved 

the visuo-spatial sketchpad (tapping a pattern 

on a keypad) or it involved the phonological 

loop (counting aloud repeatedly from 1 to 10) 

(see Chapter 6 for accounts of the visuo-spatial 

sketchpad and phonological loop).
According to KosslynÕs theory, visual imagery 
and spatial tapping tasks both involve use of

the visual buffer, and so there should be an 
interference effect. This is precisely what was 

found (see Figure 3.25), since spatial tapping 

reduced the vividness of visual imagery more 
than the vividness of auditory imagery. The 

counting task reduced the vividness of auditory 

imagery more than that of visual imagery, pre-

sumably because auditory perception and audi-

tory imagery use the same mechanisms.
According to Kosslyn (1994, 2005), much 
processing associated with visual imagery occurs 

in early visual cortex (BA17 and BA18), although 

several other brain areas"
Segment_203,are also involved.   Kosslyn and Thompson (2003) considered 59   brain-imaging studies in which activation of   early visual cortex had been assessed.

(e.g., Aleman et al., 2002).
The Þ nding that activation in early visual cortex 

is associated with visual imagery provides no 

guarantee that it is 
essential
 for visual imagery. 
More convincing evidence was reported by 

Kosslyn et al. (1999). Participants memorised 

a stimulus containing four sets of stripes, after 

which they formed a visual image of it and 

compared the stripes (e.g., in terms of their 

relative width). Immediately before performing 

the task, some participants received repetitive 

transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS; see 

Glossary) applied to Area 17 (V1). rTMS signi-

Þ
 cantly impaired performance on the imagery 
task, thus showing it is causally 
involved in 
imagery.
Sceptics might argue that showing that the 
brain areas involved in visual imagery are often 

the same as those involved in visual perception 

does not prove that imagery and perception 

i nvolve 
the same 
processes
. The Þ ndings of Klein 
et al. (2004) provide reassurance. Participants 

were presented with ß
 ickeringblack-and-white, 
bow-tie shaped stimuli with a horizontal or a 

vertical orientation in the perceptual condition. 

In the imagery condition, they imagined the same 

bow-tie shaped stimuli. Unsurprisingly, there was 

more activation within early visual 
cortex in the 
vertical direction when the stimulus 
was in the 
vertical orientation and more 
in the 
horizontal 
direction when it was in the horizontal orienta-

tion. Dramatically, the same was also the case in  

the imagery condition, t
hus providing powerful 
evidence that the 
processes involved in visual 
imagery closely approximate to those involved 

in visual perception (see Figure 3.26).
Ganis, Thompson, and Kosslyn (2004) 
used fMRI to compare patterns of activation 
across most of the brain in visual perception and 

imagery."

them (e.g., contains circular parts). There were 

two main Þ ndings. First, there was extensive 

overlap in the brain areas associated with percep-

tion 
and imagery. This was especially so in the 
frontal and parietal areas, perhaps because 

perception and imagery both involve similar 

cognitive control processes. Second, the brain 

areas activated during imagery formed a 
subset
 
of those activated during perception, especially 

in temporal and occipital regions. This suggests 

that visual imagery involves some (but not all) 

of the processes involved in visual perception.
Imagery does not resemble 
perception
In spite of the Þ ndings discussed above, there 
is evidence suggesting important differences 

between visual imagery and visual perception. 

For example, imagine a cube balanced on one 

corner and then cut across the equator. What 

is the shape of the cut surface when the top is cut  

off? Most students say it is a square (Ian Gordon, 

personal communication), but in fact it is a 

regular hexagon. The implication is that images 

often consist of simpliÞ
 ed structural descrip-
tions that omit important aspects of the object 

being imagined.
Slezak (1991, 1995) also found that images 
can be seriously deÞ cient when compared against 

v isual percepts. Participants memorised an image 

resembling one of those shown in Figure 3.27. 

They then rotated the image by 90 degrees 

clockwise and reported what they saw. No 

participants reported seeing the objects that are 

clearly visible if you rotate the book. This was 

not
 really a deÞ ciency in memory Ð participants 

who sketched the image from memory and then 

rotated it did see the new object. It seems that 

information contained in images cannot be used 

as ß exibly as visual information.
If perception and imagery involve the same  
mechanisms, we might expect that brain damage 

would"

In considering this evidence, bear in mind the 
main differences between perception and im-

agery. Processing in the visual buffer depends 

mainly on external stimulation in perception, 

whereas non-pictorial information stored in 

long-term memory within the inferior temporal 

lobe is of crucial importance in imagery (see 

Figure 3.28).
Some brain-damaged patients have essen-
tially intact visual perception but impaired 
visual imagery. According to Bartolomeo (2002, 

p. 362), ÒIn the available cases of (relatively) 

isolated deÞ cits of visual mental imagery, the 

left temporal lobe seems always extensively 

damaged.Ó For example, Sirigu and Duhamel 

(2001) studied a patient, JB, who had extensive  

damage to both temporal lobes. JB initially 

had severe problems with visual perception, 

but these problems disappeared subsequently. 

However, JB continued to have a profound

1994) argued that visual imagery differs from 

visual perception in that there is a process of 

generation
 Ð visual images are 
constructed 

from object information stored 
in the temporal 
lobe. The notion that object information is 

stored in the temporal lobe was supported by 

Lee, Hong, Seo, Tae, and Hong (2000). They 

applied elec
trical cortical stimulation to epileptic 
patients,  
and found that they only had con-
scious visual experience of complex visual forms 

(e.g., animals, people) 
when the temporal lobe 

was stimulated. In sum, the 
co-existence of intact 
visual perception but impaired visual imagery 

may occur because stored object knowledge is 

more important in visual imagery.
The opposite pattern of intact visual imag-
ery but impaired visual perception has also 

been reported (see Bartolomeo, 2002). Some

and Nowak (1995) described the case of a 

patient with AntonÕs syndrome, nearly all of 

whose primary visual cortex had been destroyed. 

In spite of that, the patient generated visual 

images so vivid they were mistaken for real 

visual perception.
Bartolomeo et al. (1998) studied a patient, 
D, with brain damage to parts of early visual 

cortex (BA18) and to temporal cortex. She had 

severe perceptual impairment for object rec-

ognition, colour identiÞ cation, and face rec-

ognition. However, ÒMadame D performed the  

imagery tasks . . . in such a rapid and easy way 

as to suggest that her imagery resources were 

relatively spared by the lesions.Ó

imagery and visual perception. The central 
assumption of KosslynÕs perceptual anticipa-

tion theory, namely, that very similar processes 

are involved in imagery and perception, has 

attracted considerable support. The predictions 

that perceptual and imagery tasks will have 

facilitatory effects on each other if the con-

tent is the same, but will interfere with each 

other otherwise, have been supported. Of most 

importance, visual imagery involving attention 

to high-resolution details consistently involves 

early visual cortex, a Þ nding much more in line 

with KosslynÕs theory than PylyshynÕs.

is puzzling from the per

 dissociations occur between 

perception and imagery. Finally, we know that 

different brain areas are involved in imagery 

for object shapes and imagery for movement 

and spatial rela tionships. However, these forms 

of imagery are presumably often used together, 

and we do not know how that happens.
Perceptual organisation
¥
The Gestaltists put forward several laws of perceptual organisation that were claimed to

assist in Þ gureÐground segregation. There is much evidence supporting these laws, but

they generally work better with artiÞ 
cial stimuli than with natural scenes. The Gestaltists
provided descriptions rather than explanations, and they incorrectly argued that the

principles of visual organisation do not depend on experience and learning. Subsequent

research has indicated that top-down processes are important in perceptual organisation,

and there is evidence that the processes involved in object recognition are similar to those

involved in Þ
 gureÐground segregation. In addition, the principle of uniform connectedness
seems to be important in perceptual grouping.
Theories of object recognition
¥
Biederman assumed that objects consist of basic shapes known as geons. An objectÕs geons
are determined by edge-extraction processes focusing on invariant properties of edges,

and the resultant geonal description is viewpoint-invariant. However, edge information

is often insufÞ 
cient to permit object identiÞ cation. BiedermanÕs theory was designed to
account for easy categorical discriminations, and the viewpoint-invariant processes empha-

sised by him are generally replaced by viewpoint-dependent processes for hard within-

category discriminations. The processes involved in o"
Segment_210,"bject recognition are more varied  and ß exible than assumed by Biederman, and it is likely that viewpoint-invariant and  viewpoint-dependent information is combined in object recognition.

viewpoint-dependent information is combined in object recognition.
Cognitive neuroscience approach to object recognition
¥
Inferotemporal cortex plays a major role in object recognition. Some inferotemporal
neurons have high invariance (consistent with viewpoint-invariant theories of object recogni-

tion), whereas others have low invariance (consistent with viewpoint-dependent theories).

Regions of inferotemporal cortex seem to exhibit some specialisation for different categories

of object. Most research has focused on the ventral stream and on bottom-up processes.

However, the dorsal stream contributes to object recognition, and top-down processes

often have an important inß 
uence on object recognition.

Cognitive neuropsychology of object recognition
¥ 
Visual agnosia can be divided into apperceptive agnosia and associative agnosia, but this 
is an oversimpliÞ cation. Much of the evidence is consistent with a hierarchical model in 

which object recognition proceeds through several stages, with different agnosic patients 

having special problems at different processing stages. This hierarchical model is based 

on the assumption that processing stages occur in a serial, bottom-up fashion. However
, 
it is likely that there are some top-down inß uences during object recognition, and that 

processing often does not proceed neatly from one stage to the next.
Face recognition
¥ 
Face recognition involves more holistic processing than object recognition, as is shown 
by the inversion, partÐwhole, and composite effects. Prosopagnosic patients often show 

covert face recognition in spite of not recognising familiar faces overtly. There is a double 

dissociation in which som"

The hypothesis that",Explores how memory influences cognition.,"emotion, recognition, perception",Nested under Chapter on perception,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in memory,Aligned with contemporary studies on perception,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_423,"e individuals have severe problems with face recognition but 

not with object recognition, and others have the opposite pattern. The fusiform face area 

(typically damaged in prosopagnosics) plays a major role in face recognition but is not 

used exclusively for that purpose. The hypothesis that faces only appear special because 

we have much expertise with them has not received much support. According to Bruce 

and Y
oungÕs model, there are major differences in the processing of familiar and unfamiliar 
faces, and processing of facial identity is separate from processing of facial expression. 

There is broad support for the model, but it is clearly oversimpliÞ
 ed.
Visual imagery
¥ 
According to KosslynÕs perceptual anticipation theory, there are close similarities between 

visual imagery and visual perception, with images being depictive representations. It is 

assumed that these depictive representations are created in early visual cortex. In contrast, 

Pylyshyn proposed a propositional theory, according to which people asked to form images
 
make use of tacit propositional knowledge. There is strong evidence from fMRI and rTMS 

studies that early visual cortex is of central importance in visual imagery. Many brain-

damaged patients have comparable impairments of perception and imagery. However, the 

existence of dissociations between perception and imagery in such patients poses problems 

for KosslynÕs theory.

PERCEPTION, MOTION,

DIRECT PERCEPTION
James Gibson (1950, 1966, 1979) put forward 
a radical theoretical approach to visual percep-

tion that was l"
Segment_213,"argely ignored for many years.

It was generally assumed until about 25 years 

ago that the central function of visual perception 

is to allow us to identify or recognise objects 

in the world around us. This involves extensive 

cognitive processing, including relating infor-

mation extracted from the visual environment 

to our stored knowledge about objects (see 

Chapter 3). Gibson argued that this approach 

is of limited relevance to visual perception in 

the real world. In our evolutionary history, 

vision initially developed to allow our ancestors 

to respond appropriately to the environment 

(e.g., killing animals for food; avoiding falling 

over precipices). Even today, perceptual infor-

mation is used mainly in the organisation of 

action, and so perception and action are closely  

intertwined. As Wade and Swanston (2001, p. 4)  

pointed out, Gibson ﬁincorporated the time 

dimension into perception, so that all perception 

becomes motion perception.ﬂ
Gibson argued that perception in˜
 uences 
our actions without any need for complex 

cognitive processes to occur. The reason is because 

the information available from environmental 

stimuli is much greater than had previously 

been assumed. There are clear links between 

Gibson™s views on the nature of perception 

and the vision-for-action system proposed by 
INTRODUCTION
Several issues considered in this chapter hark 

back to earlier discussions in Chapter 2. The 

˚
 rst major theme addressed in this chapter is 
perception for action, or how we manage 

to act appropriately on the environment and 

the objects within it. Of relevance here are 

theories (e.g., the perceptionŒaction theory; the 

dual-process approach) distinguishing between 

processes and systems involved in vision-for-

perception and those involved in vision-for-action. 

Those theories are discussed in Chapter 2. Here 

we will consider theories 
providing more 
detailed 
accounts of vision-for-action and /or th"
Segment_214,"e work-  ings of the dorsal pathway allegedly underlying   vision-for-action. The second theme addressed is perception  of movement.

The second theme addressed is perception 
of movement. Again, this issue was considered 

to some extent in Chapter 2, to which refer-

ence should be made. In this chapter, we 

focus 
speci˚
 cally on perception of biological 
movement.
Finally, we consider the extent to which 
visual perception depends on attention. We 

will see there is convincing evidence that 

attention plays an important role in deter-

mining which aspects of the environment are 

consciously perceived. This issue is discussed 

at the end of the chapter because it provides 

a useful bridge between the areas of visual 

perception and attention (the subject of the 

next chapter).

the problems experienced by pilots taking off 
and landing. This led him to wonder what 

information pilots have available to them while 

performing these manoeuvres. There is 
optic 

ß
 ow
 (Gibson, 1950), which consists of the 
changes in the pattern of light reaching an 

observer that are created when he /she moves 

or parts of the visual environment move. The 

typical perceptual experience produced by 

optic ˜ow can be illustrated by considering a 

pilot approaching a landing strip. The point 

towards which the pilot is moving (the 
focus 

of expansion
 or pole) appears motionless, with 

the rest of the visual environment apparently 

moving away from that point (see Figure 4.1). 

The further away any part of the landing strip 

is from that point, the greater is its apparent 

speed of movement. Over time, aspects of the 

environment at some distance from the focus 

of expansion pass out of the visual ˚
 eld and 
are replaced by new aspects emerging at the 

focus of expansion. A shift in the centre of 

the out˜ ow indicates a change in the plane™s 

direction.

Milner and Goodale (1995, 1998; see Chapter 

2). According to both theoretical accounts, there 

is an intimate relationship between perception 

and action. In addition, perception in˜
 uences 
action rapidly and with minimal involvement of  

conscious awareness. Support for this position 

was reported by Chua and Enns (2005). Their 

participants could not gain conscious access to 

the information they used in pointing, even though  

they could see and feel their own hands.
Gibson (1979) regarded his theoretical 
approach as 
ecological
, emphasising that the 

central function of perception is to facilitate 

interactions between the individual and his / her 

environment. More speci˚ cally, he put forward 

a direct theory of perception:
When I assert that perception of the 

environment is direct, I mean that it is 

not mediated by 
retinal
 pictures, 
neural
 

pictures, or 
mental
 pictures. 
Direct
 

perception
 is the activity of getting 

information from the ambient array of 

light. I call this a process of 
information
 

pickup
 that involves . . . looking 
around,

(p. 147). 
We will brie˜ y consider some of Gibson™s theor

all the visual information from the environ-

ment striking the eye.

expansion) is an invariant feature of the 
optic 
array (discussed earlier). Another invariant i s  

useful in terms of maintaining size constancy: 

the ratio of an object™s height to the distance 

between its base and the horizon is invariant 

regardless of its distance from the viewer. 

This invariant is known as the horizon ratio 

relation.
Affordances
How did Gibson account for the role of meaning 

in perception? Gibson (1979) claimed that all 

potential uses of objects (their 
affordances
) 

are directly perceivable. For example, a ladder 

ﬁaffordsﬂ ascent or descent, and a chair ﬁaffordsﬂ 

sitting. The notion of affordances was even 

applied (implausibly) to postboxes (p. 139): 
environments differed in other ways as well. As  

Rushton (2008) pointed out, if you are walking 

towards a target in a richly textured environ-

ment, objects initially to the left of the target 

will remain to the left, and those to the right 

will remain to the right. Participants may have 

used that information rather than optic ˜
 ow.
According to Gibson (1950), optic ˜

Gibson was so impressed by the wealth of 

sensory information available to pilots in optic 

˜ ow ˚
elds that he devoted himself to an 
analysis of the information available in other 

visual environments. For example, 
texture 

gradients
 provide very useful information. As 

we saw in Chapter 2, objects slanting away 

from you have a gradient (rate of change) of 

texture density as you look from the near edge 

to the far edge. Gibson (1966, 1979) claimed 

that observers ﬁpick upﬂ this information from 

the optic array, and so some aspects of depth 

are perceived directly.
Gibson (1966, 1979) argued that certain 
higher-order characteristics of the visual array 

(
invariants
) remain unaltered as observers 

move around their environment. The fact that 

they remain the same over different viewing 

angles makes invariants of particular importance.

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
More generally, Gibson was determined to 
show that all the information needed to make 

sense of the visual environment is directly present  

in the visual input.
Gibson™s notion of affordances has received 
some "
Segment_218,support from empirical research. Di Stasi   and Guardini (2007) asked observers to judge   the affordance of ﬁclimbabilityﬂ of steps varying   in height. The step height that was judged the   most ﬁclimbableﬂ was the one that would have    produced the minimum expenditure of energy. Gibson argued th,Explores how emotion influences cognition.,"recognition, attention, emotion",Nested under Chapter on memory,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in awareness,Aligned with contemporary studies on emotion,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_157,"support from empirical research. Di Stasi 

and Guardini (2007) asked observers to judge 

the affordance of ﬁclimbabilityﬂ of steps varying 

in height. The step height that was judged the 

most ﬁclimbableﬂ was the one that would have  

produced the minimum expenditure of energy.
Gibson argued that an object™s affordances 
are perceived directly. Pappas and Mack (2008) 

presented images of objects so brie˜
 y that they 
were not consciously perceived. In spite of that, 

each object™s main affordance produced motor 

priming. Thus, for example, the presentation of 

a hammer caused activation in those parts of the  

brain involved in preparing to use a hammer.
Resonance
How exactly do human perceivers ﬁpick upﬂ 

the invariant information supplied by the visual 

world? According to Gibson, there is a process 

of 
resonance
, which he explained by analogy 
to the workings of a radio. When a radio set 

is turned on, there may be only a hissing sound. 

However, if it is tuned in properly, speech or 

music will be clearly audible. In Gibson™s terms, 

the radio is now resonating with the information 

contained in the electromagnetic radiation.
The above analogy suggests that perceivers 
can pick up information from the environment 

in a relatively automatic way if attuned to it. 

The radio operates in a holistic way, in the 

sense that damage to any part of its circuitry 

would prevent it from working. In a similar 

way, Gibson assumed that the nervous system 

works in a holistic way when perceiving.
ﬁThe postbox . . . affords letter-mailing to a

are seeing.ﬂ That sounds like mumbo jumbo. 
However, Fodor and Pylyshyn illustrated their 

point by considering someone called Smith who 

is lost at sea. Smith sees the Pole Star, but what 

matters for his survival is whether he sees it as 

the Pole Star or as simply an ordinary star. If it  

is the former, this will be useful for navigational 

purposes; if it is the latter, Smith remains as lost 

as ever. Gibson™s approach is relevant to ﬁseeingﬂ 

but has little to say about ﬁseeing asﬂ.
Third, Gibson™s argument that we do not 
need to assume the existence of internal rep-

resentations (e.g., object memories) to understand  

perception is seriously ˜ awed. It follows from 

the logic of Gibson™s position that, ﬁThere are 

invariants specifying a friend™s face, a perform-

Titanic
, 

and no knowledge of the friend, of the play, 

or of maritime history is required to perceive 

these thingsﬂ (Bruce, Green, & Georgeson, 

2003, p. 410).
Fourth, as discussed in the next section, 
Gibson™s views are oversimpli˚ ed when applied  

to the central issue with which he was concerned.

From an ecological perspective, it is very impor-

we move around the 

environment. For example, what information 

do we use when walking towards a given target? 

If we are to avoid premature death, we must 

ensure we are not hit by cars when crossing the 

road, and when driving we must avoid hitting 

cars coming the other way. Visual perception 

plays a major role in facilitating human locomo-

tion 
and ensuring our safety. Some of the main 
processes involved are discussed below.

and future path

at the end of a ˚ eld), we use visual information 
Evaluation
The ecological approach to perception has 

proved successful in various ways. First, Gibson  

was right to emphasise that visual perception 

evolved in large part to allow us to move 

successfully around the environment.
Second, Gibson was far ahead of his time. 
It is now often accepted (e.g., Milner & Goodale, 

1995, 1998; Norman, 2002) that there are two  

visual systems, a vision-for-perception system 

and a vision-for-action system. Gibson argued 

that our perceptual system allows us to respond 

rapidly and accurately to environmental stimuli 

without making use of memory, and these are 

all features of the vision-for-action system. This  

system was largely ignored prior to his pioneering  

research and theorising.
Third, Gibson was correct that visual stimuli 
provide much more information than had 

previously been believed. Traditional laboratory 

research had generally involved static observers 

looking at impoverished visual displays. In 

contrast, Gibson correctly emphasised that 

we spend much of our time in motion. The 

moment-by-moment changes in the optic array 

provide much useful information (discussed in 

detail shortly).
Fourth, Gibson was correct to argue that 
inaccurate perception often depends on the use 

of very arti˚
 cial situations and a failure to"

on the important role of visual perception in 

guiding behaviour. For example, many power-

ful illusory effects present when observers make 

judgements about visual stimuli disappear 

when observers grasp the stimuli in question 

(see Chapter 2).
What are the limitations of Gibson™s 
approach? 
First, the processes involved in 
perception are much more complicated than 

implied by Gibson. Many of these complexities 

were discussed in detail in Chapters 2 and 3.
Second, Gibson largely ignored the vision-
for-perception system. We can approach this 

issue by considering a quotation from Fodor 

and Pylyshyn (1981, p. 189): ﬁWhat you see 

when you see a thing depends upon what the 

thing you see is. But what you see the thing as

implicates the dorsal medial superior temporal 
cortex and the ventral intraparietal area. For 

example, Britten and van Wezel (1998) found 

they could produce biases in heading perception 

in monkeys by stimulating parts of the medial 

superior temporal area. This ˚
 nding suggests 
that that area plays an important role in 

processing direction of heading. Smith, Wall, 

Williams, and Singh (2006) found that the 

human medial superior temporal area was 

strongly and selectively responsive to optic 

˜
 ow (see Figure 4.2). In contrast, the human 
medial temporal area was not selective for 

optic ˜ ow because it also responded to random 

motion.
Warren and Hannon (1988) produced two 
˚
 lms consisting of patterns of moving dots. Each 
˚
 lm simulated the optic ˜ ow that would be 
produced if someone moved in a given direction.

The same 

retinal ˜

mation to calculate rotary ˜ ow was available 

only in the ˚ rst condition. The accuracy of 

heading judgments was unaffected by the extra-

retinal information, suggesting that observers 

may use optic ˜ ow on its own.
Subsequent research has indicated that 
extra-retinal information about eye and head 

movements often in˜ uences heading judge-

ments. Wilkie and Wann (2003) had observers 

watch ˚
 lms simulating brisk walking or steady 
cycling/slow driving along a linear path while 

˚
 xating a target offset from the direction of 
to move directly towards it. Gibson (1950) 

emphasised the importance of optic ˜
 ow. When 
someone is moving forwards in a straight line, 

the point towards which he /she is moving (the 

point of expansion) appears motionless. In 

contrast, the point around that point seems to 

be expanding. Various aspects of optic ˜
 ow 
might be of crucial importance to an observer™s 

perception of heading (the point towards 

which he /she is moving at any given moment). 

Gibson (1950) proposed a global radial out-

˜
 ow hypothesis, according to which the overall 
or global out˜ ow pattern speci˚ es an observer™s 

heading. If we happen not to be moving directly 

towards our goal, we can resolve the problem 

simply by using the focus of expansion and 

optic ˜ ow to bring our heading into alignment 

with our goal.
Gibson™s views make reasonable sense 
when applied to an individual moving straight 

from point A to point B. However, complica-

tions occur when we start considering what 

happens when we cannot move directly to our 

goal (e.g., going around a bend in the road; 

avoiding obstacles). There are also issues 

c oncerning head and eye movements. The

Thus, it is often dif˚ cult for us to use information

would be by using extra-retinal information 

about eye and head movements (e.g., signals 

from stretch receptors in the eye muscles) to 

remove the effects of rotary ˜

presented 50 ms apart, apparent motion was 

perceived. When they were presented 1000 ms 

apart, no apparent motion was perceived. The 

camera position moved by 7.5, 15, 22.5, or 

30 cm between photographs, and the observers™ 

task in each case was to identify the direction 

of heading.
Hahn et al.™s (2003) ˚ ndings are shown in

relatively great. However, the key ˚

that performance was reasonably good even 

when apparent motion information was

of apparent motion (and thus of optic-˜

We often use factors over and above 
optic-˜
 ow information when making heading 
judgements, which is not surprising given the 

typical richness of the available environmental 

information. Van den Berg and Brenner (1994) 

pointed out that we only need one eye to use 

optic-˜
 ow information. However, they found 
that heading judgements were more accurate 

when observers used both eyes rather than 

only one. Binocular disparity in the two-eye 

condition probably provided useful additional 

information about the relative depths of objects 

in the display.
Gibson assumed that optic-˜

generated by motion are of fundamental 

importance when we head towards a goal. 

However, Hahn, Andersen, and Saidpour (2003) 

found that motion is 
not

tend to look ahead some distance, which is 

consistent with the notion that they are making 

use of information about the future path (see 

Wilkie, Wann, & Allison, 2008, for a review). 

However, such evidence does 
not
 show that 

advanced ˚ xation is necessary for accurate 

steering. Wilkie et al. provided stronger evidence 

in a study in which participants sitting on a 

bicycle trainer in a simulator had to steer through 

several slalom gates. Participants typically 

˚
 xated the most immediate gate until it was 
1.5 metres away, and then switched their gaze 

t o the next gate. Of more importance, there were 

signi˚
 cant increases in steering errors when 
the situation was changed so that participants 

could not use their normal looking patterns. 

Thus, ef˚ cient steering along a complex route 

requires that people engage in advanced ˚
 xation  
to plot their future path.
It has often been suggested (e.g., Land & 
Lee, 1994) that drivers approaching a bend 

focus on the 
tangent point
. This is the point 

at which the direction of the inside edge of the 

road appears to reverse (see Figure 4.4). Note 

that the tangent point is not ˚ xed but keeps 

moving over time. It is assumed that the tangent 

point is important because it allows drivers to 

estimate accurately the curvature of the road. 

Mars (2008) found that drivers often ˚

the tangent point when allowed to look wherever 

they wanted. However, there is nothing magical 

about the tangent point. Mars used conditions 

in which drivers ˚ xated a moving target at the

indicating that visual direction is not always

Evidence: future path
Wilkie and Wann (2006) argued that judgements  

of heading (the direction in which someone 

is moving at a given moment) are of little 

relevance if someone is moving along a curved 

path. According to them, path judgements 

(i.e., identifying future points along one™s path) 

are more important. Observers made accurate 

heading and path judgements when travelling 

along straight paths. With curved paths, how-

ever, 
path judgements were considerably more 
accurate than heading judgements (mean errors 

5 and 13 degrees, respectively). The errors with 

heading judgements were so large that drivers 

and cyclists would be ill-advised to rely on 

them. Supporting evidence comes from Wilkie 

and Wann (2003), who found that observers 

steered less accurately when told to ˚
 xate their 
heading rather than their path.
The notion that separate processes underlie 
heading and path judgements received support 

in a study by Field, Wilkie, and Wann (2007). 

Processing future path information was associ-

ated with activation in the superior parietal lobe. 

This is distinct from the brain areas typically 

associated with processing of optic-˜
 ow and 
heading information (dorsal medial superior 

temporal and ventral intraparietal areas; Britten, 

2008).

aspects of the visual environment that in˜

we still know relatively little about the ways 

in which these aspects
 interact
 and combine to 
determine our actions.
Time to contact
Everyday life is full of numerous situations in 

which we want to know the moment at which 

there is going to be contact between us and 

some object. These situations include ones in 

which we are moving towards some object 

(e.g., a wall) and those in which an object (e.g., 

a ball) is approaching us. We could calculate 

the time to contact by estimating the initial 

distance away from us of the object, estimating 

our speed, and then combining these two 

estimates into an overall estimate of the 
time to  
contact
 by dividing distance by speed. However, 

combining the two kinds of information would 

be fairly complicated.
Lee (1976) argued that it is unnecessary to 
perceive the distance or speed of an approaching 

object to work out the time to contact, provided 

that we are approaching it (or it is approaching 

us) with constant velocity. Lee de˚ ned tau as 

the size of an object™s retinal image divided by

What are the limitations of research in this 
area? First, when we move through a typical 

visual environment, we are exposed to a 

bewildering amount of information that could 

potentially be used to allow us to arrive ef˚
 ciently 
at our goal. It requires considerable experimental 

ingenuity to decide which information is actually  

used by individuals on the move.
Second, the role of learning has been under-
researched. Fajen (2008) gave participants the

Savelsbergh, Whiting, and Bootsma (1991) 
argued that Lee™s hypothesis could be tested fairly 
directly by manipulating the rate of expansion. 

They achieved this by requiring participants 

to catch a de˜ ating ball swinging towards 

them on a pendulum. The rate of expansion 

of the retinal image is less for a de˜ ating than a  

non-d e ˜
 ating ball. Thus, on Lee™s hypothesis, 
participants should have assumed the de˜
 ating 
ball would take longer to reach them than was 

actually the case. Savelsbergh et al. found the 

peak grasp closure was 5 ms later with the 

de˜
 ating ball than a non-de˜ ating ball, and 
Savelsbergh, Pijpers, and van Santvoord (1993) 

obtained similar ˚ ndings. However, these ˚
 nd-
ings only super˚ cially support Lee™s hypothesis. 

Strict application of the hypothesis to Savelsbergh 

et al.™s (1993) data indicated that the peak 

grasp closure should have occurred 230 ms 

later to the de˜
 ating ball than to the non-
de˜
 ating one. In fact, the average difference 
was only 30 ms.
When we try to catch a ball falling vertically 
towards us, it accelerates due to the force 

ofgravity. Evidence that we take account of 

gravity was reported by Lacquaniti, Carozzo, 

and Borghese (1993). They studied observers 

catching balls dropped from heights of under 

1.5 metres. The observers™ performance was 

better than predicted by the tau hypothesis, 

presumably because they took account of the 

ball™s acceleration.
McIntyre, Zago, Berthoz, and Lacquaniti 
(2001) found that astronauts showed better 

timing when catching balls on earth than in 

zero-gravity conditions during a space ˜
 ight.

actually did if they had simply misapplied their

that were identi˚ ed by Tresilian (1999):

objects that are spherically symmetrical. 

It would be less useful when trying to 

catch a rugby ball.

Tau requires that the image size and expan-

sion of 
the object are both detectable.
Tresilian (1999) argued that estimates of 
time to contact are arrived at by combining 

information from several different cues 
(prob-
ably including tau). The extent to which an
y 
particular cue is used depends on the 
observer™s 
task.
In our discussion of the evidence, we will 
focus on two main lines of research. First, we 

consider the processes involved in catching a 

moving ball. Second, we turn our attention to 

studies of drivers™ braking in order to stop at 

a given point.
Evidence: catching balls
Suppose you try to catch a ball that is coming 

towards you. Lee (1976) assumed that your 

judgement of the time to contact depends 

crucially on the rate of expansion of the ball™s 

retinal image. Supporting evidence was obtained 

by Benguigui, Ripoli, and Broderick (2003). 

Their participants were presented with a hori-

zontal moving stimulus that was accelerating 

or decelerating. The stimulus was hidden from 

view shortly before reaching a speci˚
 ed position, 
and participants estimated its time of arrival. 

The predict"

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
Finally, note that people are very adaptable 
Œthe strategy they use to catch a ball depends
on the circumstances. Mazyn, Savelsbergh, 

Montagne, and Lenoir (2007) compared peo-

ple™s movements when catching a ball under 

normal conditions with their performance in 

a condition in which all the lights went out 

within 3 ms of their initial movement. The lights -

out condition caused the participants to delay 

the onset of any movement and to engage in 

much advance planning of their movements.
Evidence: braking by drivers
In everyday life, it is important for drivers to 

make accurate decisions about when to brake 

and how rapidly they should decelerate to 

avoid cars in front of them. According to Lee 

(1976), drivers use tau when braking to a stop 

at a given point. More speci˚ cally, they brake 

so as to hold constant the rate of change of 

tau. This is an ef˚ cient strategy in principle 

because it involves relatively simple calculations  

and only requires constant braking. Yilmaz 

and Warren (1995) obtained some support for 

Lee™s position. Participants were told to stop 

at a stop sign in a simulated driving task. There 

was generally a linear reduction in tau during 

braking, but sometimes there were large changes 

in tau shortly before stopping.
Terry, Charlton, and Perrone (2008) gave 
participants a simulated driving task in which 

they braked when the vehicle in front of them 

decelerated. This task was performed on its 

own or at the same time as the secondary task 

of searching for pair"

Thus, the calculation of tau   requires attentional processes. Rock, Harris, and Yates (2006) reported  ˚  ndings inconsistent with Lee™s hypothesis.

Tau (estimated time to contact) was signi˚

less in the condition with the distracting 

secondary task. Thus, the calculation of tau 

requires attentional processes.
Rock, Harris, and Yates (2006) reported 
˚
 ndings inconsistent with Lee™s hypothesis. 
Drivers performed a real-world driving task 

requiring them to brake to stop at a visual 

target. Braking under real-world conditions 

was smoother and more consistent than braking 

in most previous laboratory-based studies. Of 

most importance, there was very little support 

for the tauŒdot hypothesis. The ˚
 ndings of 
knowledge of gravity in zero-gravity conditions. 

There are probably two reasons why the errors 

were relatively modest:
The astronauts had only vague knowledge 
(1) 
of the effects of gravity.

The astronauts changed their predictions 
(2) 
of when the ball would arrive as they saw 

it approaching them.
According to the tau hypothesis, the rate 
of expansion of an object™s retinal image is 

estimated from changes in optic ˜
 ow
. 
How-
ever, as Schrater, Knill, and Simoncelli (2001) 

pointed out, rate of expansion could also be 

estimated from changes in the size or scale 

of an object™s features. They devised stimuli 

in which there were gradual increases in the 

scale of object features but the optic-˜
 ow 
pattern was random. Expansion rates could be 

estimated fairly accurately from scale-change 

information in the 
absence
 of useful optic-˜
 ow 
information.
Another factor in˜ uencing our estimates 
of when a ball will arrive is binocular disparity 

(see Glossary). Rushton and Wann (1999) used  

a virtual reality situation involving catching 

balls, and manipulated tau and binocular 

disparity independently. 
When tau indicated  

contact with the ball 100 ms 
before
 binocular 
disparity, observers responded about 75 ms earlier.  

When tau indicated contact 100 ms 
after
 dis-

parity, the response was
 delayed by 35 ms. Thus,"
Segment_234,"information about tau is  combined with infor-  mation about binocular  disparity. According to   Rushton and Wann,  the source of information  specifying the  shortest time to contact is given  the greatest weight in this combination process.

Rushton and Wann, 
the source of information 
specifying the 
shortest time to contact is given 
the greatest weight in this combination process.
López-Moliner, Field, and Wann (2007) 
found that observers™ judgement of time to 

contact of a ball was determined in part by 

their knowledge of its size. When the ball was 

slightly larger or smaller than expected, this 

reduced the accuracy of observers™ performance. 

The in˜ uence of familiar size may help to explain 

why professional sportspeople can respond 

with amazing precision to balls travelling at 

high speed.

Rock et al. suggested that the drivers were 

estimating the constant ideal deceleration based 

on tau plus additional information (e.g., the

Evaluation
Much has been learned about the information 

we use when engaged in tasks such as catching 

a ball or braking to stop at a given point. In 

addition to tau, other factors involved in ball 

catching include binocular disparity, knowledge 

of object size, and our knowledge of gravity. 

Braking depends in part on trying to hold 

constant the rate of change in tau, but also 

seems to involve estimating the constant ideal 

deceleration.
What are the limitations of research in this 
area? First, it remains unclear how the various 

relevant factors are combined to permit ball 

catching or accurate braking. Second, it is known 

that the tau and tauŒdot hypotheses are inade-

quate. However, no comprehensive theory has 

replaced those hypotheses. Third, the behaviour  

of drivers when braking in the real world and 

in simulated conditions in the laboratory is 

signi˚
 cantly different (Rock et al., 2006). More 
research is needed to clarify the reasons for 

such differences.

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
Glover (2004) argued that the inferior 
parietal lobe plays a crucial role in human 
motor planning. Through the course of evolution, 

humans have become very good at using tools 

and objects, so it is very important for us to 

integrate information about object identi˚
 ca-
tion and context into our motor planning. Such 

integration occurs in the inferior parietal lobe .
There are some similarities between Glover™s 
(2004) planningŒcontrol model and Milner 

and Goodale™s (1995) theory based on two visual 

systems (this theory is discussed thoroughly in 

Chapter 2). According to Milner and Goodale, 

our vision-for-action system permits fast, 

accurate movements, and thus resembles Glover™s  

control system. However, Milner and Goodale 

(e.g., 2008) have increasingly accepted that our 

movements also often involve the vision-for-

perception system. We use this system when 

remembering which movement to make or 

when planning which particular movement 

to make. Thus, there are similarities between 

their v
ision-for-perception system and Glover™s 

planning system. However, Glover™s approach 

has three advantages over that of Milner and 

Goodale. First, he has considered planning 

processes in more detail. Second, he has focused 

more on the 
changes
 occurring during the per-

formance of an action. Third, he has identi˚
 ed 
the brain areas underlying the planning and 

control systems.

According to the model, cognitive processes 
are involved much more within the planning 

system than the control system. Evidence sup-

porting this hypothesis was reported by Glover 

and Dixon (2001). Participants reached for 

an object that had the word ﬁLARGEﬂ or the 

word ﬁSMALLﬂ written on it. It was assumed 

that any impact of these words on grasping 

behaviour would re˜
 ect the involvement of the 
cognitive system. Early in the reach (when 

movement was directed by the planning system), 

participants showed an illusion effect in that 

their grip aperture was greater for objects with 

the word ﬁLARGEﬂ on them. Later in the 

reach (when movement was directed by the 

control system), the illusion effect decreased, 

as predicted by the model.
A central assumption of the planningŒ
control model is that visual context in˜
 uences 
the planning system but not the control system. 

Mendoza, Elliott, Meegan, Lyons, and Walsh 

(2006) tested this assumption in a study based 

on the MüllerŒLyer illusion (see Figure 2.11). 

Participants pointed at the end of a horizontal 

line presented on its own, with arrowheads point-

ing 
inwards or with arrowheads pointing out-
wards. Of crucial importance, this visual stimulus 

generally 
changed
 between participants™ initial 
planning and their movements towards it. It was 

predicted from Glover™s model that the arrow-

heads would lead to movement errors when 

present during planning but not when present 

during online control of movement. These 

predictions were based on the notion that visual 

context (e.g., arrowheads) only in˜
 uences 
planning. In fact, however, the arrowheads led 

to movement errors regardless of when they

tested by Liu, Chua, and Enns (2008). The 

main task involved participants pointing at 

(and identifying) a peripheral target stimulus. 

This task was sometimes accompanied by the 

secondary task of identifying a central stimulus. 

The secondary task interfered with the planning 

of the pointing response but did not interfere 

with the pointing response itself. These ˚

Additional relevant information about the 
brain areas involved in planning and control has 

come from studies on brain-damaged patients.

lobe should have problems mainly with the 

planning of actions. Damage to the left inferior 

parietal lobe often produces 
ideomotor apraxia

in which patients ˚ nd it hard to carry out learned

patients with ideomoto"

some impairment when slicing bread even when 

both bread and knife were present. However, 

such patients are often reasonably pro˚

This pattern of performance suggests they have

adequate pointing and grasping).
Jax, Buxbaum, and Moll (2006) gave patients

they made movements towards objects with 

unimpeded vision or while blindfolded. There 

were three main ˚ ndings. First, the patients™

actions accurately. Third, as predicted by the 

planningŒcontrol model, poor performance on 

the movement tasks was associated with damage 

to the inferior parietal lobe. Thus, patients with 

damage to the inferior parietal lobe have an 

impaired planning system.
Patients with damage to the superior parietal 
lobe should have problems mainly with the control  

of action. Damage to the superior and posterior 

parietal cortex often produces optic 
ataxia (see

in planning and control are less different than 

assumed theoretically.
What brain areas are involved in planning 
and control? Evidence supporting Glover™s (2004) 

assumptions, that planning involves the inferior 

parietal lobe whereas control involves the superior 

parietal lobe, was reported by Krams, Rushworth, 

Deiber, Frackowiak, and Passingham (1998).

 nd? There was

In contrast, there was some evidence of increased
 
activity in the superior parietal lobe and cere-

bellum in conditions emphasising control.
Relevant evidence has also come from studies 
using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS; 

see Glossary) to produce ﬁtemporary lesionsﬂ 

in a given brain area. Rushworth, Ellison, and 

Walsh (2001) applied TMS to the left inferior 

parietal lobe and found this led to a lengthen-

ing of planning time. Desmurget,  Gréa, Grethe, 

Prablanc, Alexander, and Grafton (1999) applied 

TMS to an area bordering the inferior parietal 

lobe and the superior parietal 
lobe. There were 
no effects of this stimulation 
on the accuracy of 

movements to stationary targets, 
but there was 
signi˚
 cant disruption when movements needed 
to be corrected because the target 
moved. This 

˚
 nding suggests there 
was inter
ference with 
control rather than planning.
Further TMS evidence of the involvement 
of parietal cortex in visually guided action 

was reported by Davare, Duque, Vandermeeren,  

Thonnard, and Oliver (2007). They administered 

TMS to the anterior intraparietal area while 

participants prepared a movement. TMS disrupted

PERCEPTION OF HUMAN 
MOTION
Most people are very good at interpreting the 
movements of other people. They can decide very 

rapidly whether someone is walking, running, 

or limping. This is unsurprising in view of how 

important it is for us to make sense of others™ 

movements. Our focus here will be on two key 

issues. First, how successful are we at interpreting 

biological movement with very limited visual 

information? Second, do the processes involved 

in perception of biological motion differ from 

those involved in perception of motion in general? 

We will consider the second issue later in the 

light of ˚ ndings from cognitive neuroscience.
Johansson (1975) addressed the ˚
 rst issue 
using point-light displays. Actors were dressed 

entirely in black with lights attached to their 

joints (e.g., wrists, knees, ankles). They were 

˚
 lmed moving around a darkened room so that 
only the lights were visible to observers sub-

sequently watching the ˚
lm (see Figure 4.7). 
Reasonably accurate perception of a moving 

person was achieved with only six lights and a 

short segment of ˚ lm. Most observers described 

accurately the position and movements of the 

actors, and it almost seemed as if their arms 

and legs could be seen. More dramatic ˚
 ndings 
were reported by Johansson, von Hofsten, and 

Jansson (1980): observers who saw a point-light 

display for only one-˚
 fth of a second perceived 
biological motion with no apparent dif˚
 culty.
Observers can make precise discriminations 
when viewing point-light displays. Runeson 

and Frykholm (1983) asked actors to carry out

in the ability to make accurate"

of intact visual perception (see Chapter 2). Some 

optic ataxics have relatively intact velocity and 

grip aperture early in the making of a reaching 

and grasping movement but not thereafter (e.g.,  

Binkofski et al., 1998), a pattern suggesting greater 

problems with control than with planning.
Grea et al. (2002) studied IG, a patient with 
optic ataxia. She performed as well as healthy 

controls when reaching out and grasping a 

statio
nary object. However, she had much poorer 

performance when the target suddenly jumped 

to a new location. These ˚ ndings suggest IG had  

damage to the control system. Blangero et al. 

( 2008) found that CF, a patient with optic ataxia, 

was very slow to correct his movement towards 

a target that suddenly moved location. CF also 

had slowed performance when pointing towards 

stationary targets presented in peripheral vision. 

Blangero et al. concluded that CF was de˚
 cient 
in processing hand location and in detecting 

target location for peripheral targets.
Evaluation
Glover™s (2004) planningŒcontrol model has proved 

successful in several ways. First, the notion that 

cognitive processes are involved in the planning 

of actions (especially complex ones) has received 

much support. For example, Serrien, Ivry, and 

Swinnen (2007) discussed evidence indicating 

that brain areas such as dorsolateral prefrontal 

cortex, the anterior cingulate, and the pre-

supplementary 
motor area are involved in plan-
ning and monitoring action as well as in cognition. 

S econd, there is plentiful evidence that somewhat 

different processes are involved in the online 

control of action than in action planning. Third, 

the evidence from neuroimaging and transcranial 

magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies has supported 

the assumption that areas within the inferior 

and superior parietal cortex are important for 

planning and control, respectively.

Dynamic cues based on the tendency for 
(2) 
men to show relatively greater body sway 
with the upper body than with the hips 

when walking, whereas women show the 

opposite.
Sex judgements were based much more on 

dynamic cues than on structural ones when the 

two cues were in con˜
 ict. Thus, the centre of 
moment may be less important than claimed 

by Cutting et al. (1978).
Bottom-up or top-down 
processes?
Johansson (1975) argued that the ability to 
perceive biological motion is innate. He described  

the processes involved as ﬁspontaneousﬂ and 

ﬁautomaticﬂ. Support for that argument was 

reported by Simion, Regolin, and Bulf (2008), 

in a study on newborns aged between one and 

three days. These babies preferred to look at 

a display showing biological motion than one 

that did not. In addition, the babies looked 

longer at upright displays of biological motion 

than upside-down ones. What was remarkable 

was that Simion et al. used point-light displays 

of chickens, and it was impossible that the 

newborns had any visual experience of moving 

chickens. These ˚ndings led them to conclude 

that, ﬁDetection of motion is an intrinsic capacity 

of the visual systemﬂ (p. 809). These ˚
 ndings 
are consistent with 
the notion that the perception 
of biological 
motion involves relatively basic, 
bottom-up processes.

 tt, 
and Kozlowski (1978) pointed out that men 

tend to show relatively greater side-to-side 

motion (or swing) of the shoulders than of 

the hips, whereas women show the opposite. 

This happens because men typically have broad 

shoulders and narrow hips in comparison 

to women. The shoulders and hips move in 

opposition to each other, i.e., when the right 

shoulder is forward, the left hip is forward. 

We can identify the centre of moment in the 

upper body, which is the neutral reference point 

around which the shoulders and hips swing. The 

position of the centre of moment is determined 

by the relative sizes of the shoulders and hips, 

and is typically lower in men than in women. 

Cutting et al. found that the centre of moment 

correlated well with observers™ sex judgements.
There are two correlated cues that may be 
used by observers to decide whether they are 

looking at a man or a woman in point-light 

displays:
Structural cues based on width of shoulders 
(1) 
and hips; these structural cues form the 

basis of the centre of moment.

Cognitive neuroscience
Suppose the processes involved in perceiving 

biological motion differ from those involved in 

perceiving object motion generally. If so, we might 

expect to ˚ nd some patients who can detect one 

type of motion reasonably but have very impaired 

ability to detect the other type of motion. There 

is support for this prediction. There have been 

studies on ﬁmotion-blindﬂ patients with damage 

to the motion areas MT and MST who have 

severely impaired ability to perceive motion in 

general (see Chapter 2). Such patients are often 

reasonably good at detecting biological motion 

(e.g., Vaina, Cowey, LeMay, Bienfang, & Kinkinis, 

2002). In contrast, Saygin (2007) found in stroke 

patients that lesions in the superior temporal 

and premotor frontal areas were most associated 

with impaired perception of biological motion 

(see Figure 4.9). However, patients™ de˚
 cits in 
biological motion perception did not correlate 

with their ability to detect coherence of directional 

motion. This suggests that different brain areas 

underlie perception of biological motion and 

motion in general.
Several neuroimaging studies are of relevance. 
Similar brain areas to those identi˚
 ed in stroke 
patients are active when healthy participants 

perceive biological motion (Saygin, 2007). Saygin 

reviewed previous neuroimaging research, which 

had most consistently identi˚ ed the posterior 

superior temporal gyrus and sulcus as being 

activated during observation of point-light dis-

plays. For example, Grossman et al. (2000) found 

that point-light displays of biological motion 

activated an area in the superior temporal 
sulcus, 
Thornton, Rensink, and Shiffrar (2002) 
argued that perception of biological motion 

can be less straightforward an"

observers on each trial with a point-light walker 

˚
 gure embedded in masking elements. There 
were two mask conditions: (1) scrambled mask, 

in which each dot mimicked the motion of a 

dot from the walker ˚ gure; and (2) random 

mask, in which the dots moved at random. It 

was assumed that it would be more dif˚
 cult to 
perceive the walker in the scrambled condition. 

As a result, observers would have to attend 

more closely to the display to decide the direction 

in which the walker was moving. This hypothesis 

was tested by having the observers perform the 

task on its own or at the same time as a second, 

attentionally-demanding task.
What did Thornton et al. (2002) ˚
 nd? 
Observers™ ability to identify correctly the walker™s 

direction of movement was greatly impaired by 

the secondary task when scrambled masks were 

used (see Figure 4.8). However, the secondary task 

had only a modest effect when random masks 

were used. These ˚ ndings indicate that top-down

It is claimed that these neurons play 

a central role in our understanding of others™ 

intentions.
Initial evidence was reported by Gallese, 
Fadiga, Fogassi, and Rizzolatti (1996). They 

assessed brain activity in monkeys in two dif-

ferent situations: (1) the monkeys performed 

a particular action (e.g., 
grasping); and (2) the 

monkeys observed another 
monkey performing 
a similar action. Gallese et al. discovered that 

17% of the neurons in area F5 of the premotor 

cortex were activated in both situations. They 

labelled these neurons ﬁmirror neuronsﬂ.
Findings such as those of Gallese et al. 
(1996) led theorists to put forward the notion 

of a mirror neuron system. This 
mirror neuron 

system
 is formed of neurons that are activated 

when animals perform an action 
and
 when 

they observe another animal perform the same 

action. This system allegedly facilitates imitation 

and understanding of the actions of others. 

Subsequent research con˚
 rmed the importance 
of area F5 and also indicated that the superior 

temporal sulcus forms part of the mirror neuron 

system in monkeys. There is some evidence for 

a similar mirror neuron system in humans (see 

review by Rizzolatti and Craighero, 2004). 

According to Gallese et al. (2004, p. 396), this 

system is of huge importance: ﬁThe fundamental  

mechanism that allows us a direct experiential 

grasp of the minds of others is . . . direct simula-

tion of observed events through the mirror 

mechanism (mirror neuron system).
How can we show that mirror neurons are 
involved in working out 
why
 someone else is 
whereas displays of other forms of motion did not. 

However, we must not exaggerate the differences 

between per ception of biological motion and 

perception of object motion. Virji-Babul, Cheung, 

Weeks, Kerns, and Shiffrar (2008) used magneto-

encephalography (MEG; see Glossary) while 

observers watched point-light displays of human 

and object motion. For both kinds of "
Segment_249,"motion,   brain activity started in the posterior occipital   and mid-parietal areas, followed by activation   in the parietal, sensory-motor, and left temporal   regions.

What did Umiltà et al. (2001) ˚
 nd? First, 
over half of the mirror neurons tested discharged 
in the hidden condition. Second, about half of the  

mirror neurons that discharged in the hidden 

condition did so as strongly in that condition as  

in the fully visible condition. Third, Umiltà et al.  

used a third condition, which was the same as the  

hidden condition except that the monkeys knew 

no food had been placed behind the screen. In 

terms of what the monkeys could see of 
the experi-

menter™s actions, this condition was identical to  

the hidden condition. However
, mirror neurons 
that discharged in the hidden 
condition did 
not
 
discharge in this third condition.  
Thus, it was the 
meaning
 of the observed 
actions that 
determined 
activity within the mirror neuron  
system.
Is there a mirror neuron system in humans?

we have such a system. Dinstein, Hasson, Rubin, 

and Heeger (2007) assessed activation in many

being made repeatedly or 

repeatedly performed 
that movement. Some  

brain areas showed reduced 
responses only to  
repeated observed movements; 
some exhibited 
reduced responses only to 
repeated performed 

movements. However, six brain areas (includ-

ing ventral premotor cortex, 
anterior intrapa-

rietal cortex, and superior 
intraparietal cortex) 

were affected in similar fashion by 
both tasks  
(see Figure 4.10). These brain areas 
may form 
a human mirror neuron system.
There is an important limitation with the 
˚
 ndings reported by Dinstein et al. (2007). All 
they found was that neurons within the same 

brain 
areas
 responded on both tasks. Convincing 
evidence for a mirror neuron system in humans  

requires that the same 
neurons
 are activated 

whether observing a movement or performing 

it. Turella, Pierno, Tubaldi, and Castiello (2009) 

recently reviewed brain-imaging studies in this 

area, and found that none of them satis˚
 edthat 
requirement. They concluded that the available 

evidence is only weakly supportive of the notion 

of a mirror neuron system in humans.
Iacoboni, Molnar-Szakacs, Gallese, Buccino, 
Mazziotta, and Rizzolatti (2005) argued that 

our understanding of the intentions behind 
performing certain actions as well as deciding 

what
 those actions are? One way is to demon-

strate that mirror neurons discharge when the 

participant cannot see the action but can infer 

what it is likely to be. Precisely this was done 

by Umiltà et al. (2001). They used two main 

conditions. In one condition, the experimenter™s 

action directed towards an object was fully 

visible to the monkey participants. In the other 

condition, the monkeys saw the same action 

but the most important part of the action was 

hidden from them behind a screen. Before each 

trial, the monkeys saw the experimenter place 

some food behind the screen so they knew 

what the experimenter was reaching for.

tion condition than the action condition. This 
suggests that the mirror neuron system is 

involved in understanding the intentions behind 

observed actions, because it was only in the 

intention condition that the participants could 

work out 
why
 the person was grasping the 

cup.
Overall evaluation
Our ability to perceive biological motion with 

very limited visual information is impressive. 

There is reasonable evidence that our ability 

to perceive biological motion depends on a 

combination of bottom-up and top-down pro-

cesses. Evidence from brain-imaging studies 

and from brain-damaged patients suggests 

that the brain areas involved in perception 

of biological motion differ from those used in 

perceiving motion in general.
Recent research has suggested that we use 
a mirror neuron system to make sense of the 

movements of other people.
What are the limitations of research in this 
area? First, relatively little is known about 

the 
ways in which bottom-up and top-down 
someone else™s 
actions is often helped by taking 
account 
of the context. For example, someone 
may shout loudly at 
another person because  
they are angry or 
because they are acting in a 
play. Iacoboni et al. investigated whether the 

mirror neuron 
system in humans was sensitive 

to context using 
three conditions:

on change blindness have shed light on the 

processes underlying our conscious awareness 

of the visual world. Fourth, as already implied, 

studies on change blindness have produced 

˚

The existence of change blindness means 
that we rarely spot unintended changes in ˚

Magicians have pro˚ ted over the years from 
the phenomenon of change blindness (Kuhn, 

Amlani, & Rensink, 2008). It is often thought 

that magicians baf˜ e us because the hand is 

quicker than the eye. That is not the main 

reason. Most magic tricks involve misdirection, 

in which the magician directs spectators™ attention 

away from some action crucial to the success of  

the trick. When this is done skilfully, spectators 

fail to see how the magician is doing his/her 

tricks while thinking they have seen everything 

that is going on.
We often greatly overestimate our ability to 
detect visual changes. In one study, participants 

saw various videos involving two people having 

a conversation in a restaurant (Levin, Drivdahl, 

Momen, & Beck, 2002). In one video, the plates 

on their table changed from red to white, and in  

another a scarf worn by one of them disappeared. 

These videos had previously been used by Levin 

and Simons (1997), who found that none of 

their participants detected any of the changes. 

Levin et al. asked their participants whether 

they thought they would have noticed the changes 

if they had not been forewarned about them. 
processes interact when we perceive biological 

motion. Second, the similarities and differences 

between the processes underlying perception 

of biological motion and motion in general 

remain somewhat unclear. Third, most of the 

research on the human mirror neuron system 

has involved functional magnetic resonance 

imaging (fMRI; see Glossary). This is not pre-

cise enough to identify activity at the level of 

individual neurons, making it unwise to specu-

late on what is happening at that level. Indeed, 

according to Agnew, Bhakoo, and Puri (2007, 

p.288), ﬁThere is no direct evidence of human

neurons that respond to action.ﬂ Fourth, when

we often take account of their stable charac-

teristics (e.g., personality). It seems improbable  

that the mirror neuron system takes account 

of these stable characteristics.
CHANGE BLINDNESS
We feel we have a clear and detailed visual 

representation of the world around us. As Mack 

(2003, p. 180) pointed out, ﬁOur subjective 

impression of a coherent and richly detailed 

world leads most of us to assume that we see 

what there is to be seen by merely opening our 

eyes and looking.ﬂ As a result, we are con˚
 dent 
we could immediately detect any change in the 

visual environment provided it was suf˚
 ciently 
great. In fact, our ability to detect such changes 

is often far less impressive than we think. 

Change
 
blindness
 (the failure to detect that an 
object has moved, changed, or disappeared) is 

the phenomenon we will be discussing.
Change blindness is an important phenom-
enon for various reasons. First, whereas most 

studies of perception consider visual processes 

applied to 
single
 stimuli, those on change 

blindness are concerned with dynamic processes 

in visual perception over time applied to two or  

more stimuli. Second, as we will see, studies o n  

change blindness have greatly clari˚

of attention in scene perception. That

Sparce representations?
An obvious way of explaining many of the ˚

incomplete because they depend on our limited

used the term change blindness to describe our 

wildly optimist beliefs about our ability to 

detect visual changes.
Inattentional blindness
 (the failure to notice 
an unexpected object in a visual display) is a 

phenomenon closely resembling change blind-

ness blindness. Evidence for inattentional blind-

ness was reported in 
a famous experiment by 

Simons and Chabris (1999; see Figure 4.11).

Second, visual representations of the pre-change

attentional focus. Indeed, that assumption was 

made by several early researchers in the area 

(e.g., Rensink, O™Regan, & Clark 1997; Simons 

& Levin, 1997). However, as Simons and Rensink 

(2005) pointed out, there are various alternative 

explanations. First, detailed and complete rep-

resentations exist initially but may either decay 
Change blindness depends on overwriting rather than simply attention
As we have seen, it has often been assumed 

that change blindness occurs because our lim-

ited attentional focus only allows us to form 

visual representations of a very small number 

of objects. Convincing evidence that this assump-

tion is oversimpliÞ
 ed was reported by Landman, 
Spekreijse, and Lamme (2003), who argued that 

there is more information in the pre-change 

visual representation than generally supposed.

Eight rectangles (some horizontal and some 

vertical) were presented for 400 ms, followed 

1600 ms later by a second array of eight rec-

tangles.The task was to decide whether any of 

the rectangles had changed orientation from 

horizontal or vertical or vice versa.When there 

was no cue, participantsÕ detection performance 

suggested that their storage capacity for the 

pre-change display was only three items.This 

is consistent with the notion that attentional 

limitations greatly restrict our storage capacity.
More importantly, the Þ ndings w"

different when a cue indicating the location of 

any change was presented up to 900 ms after the  

offset of the Þ rst display.When this happened, 

the apparent storage capacity was approximately 

seven items, and it was about 4.5 items when a 

cue was presented 1500 ms after offset of the 

Þ
 rst display (see Figure 4.12). Thus, there is a con-
siderable amount of information in the pre-change 

visual representation that can be accessed pro-

vided that attention is directed rapidly to it (e.g., 

via cueing).That means that our sense that we can  

see most of the visual scene in front of us is more 

accurate than seemed to be the case based on 

most research on change blindness.
What can we conclude from this study? 
According to Landman et al. (2003), change 
blindness does not result directly from atten-

tional limitations. Instead, the explanation is as 

follows: ÒChange blindness involves overwriting 

of a large capacity representation by the post-

change displayÓ (p. 149). Our visual system is 

designed so that what we currently perceive is 

not disrupted by what we last perceived.This 

is achieved by overwriting or replacing the latter 

with the former.

(2001) asked observers to count the number o f  

white shapes or the number of black shapes 

bouncing off the edges of a display window. What 

was of interest was the percentage of observers 

noticing an unexpected object that could be white, 

light grey, dark grey, or black. 
The detection 

rates for unexpected objects 
were much higher 
when they were similar in luminance or bright-

ness to the target objects (see Figure 4.13), pre-

sumably because those resembling target objects 

were most likely to receive attention.
Earlier we discussed the surprising ˚
 nding 
of Simons and Chabris (1999) that 50% of 

observers failed to detect a woman dressed as 

a gorilla. Similarity was a factor, in that the 

gorilla was black whereas the members of the 

team whose passes the observers were counting 

were dressed in white. Simons and Chabris carried 

out a further experiment in which observers 

counted the passes made by members of the team 

dressed in white or the 
one dressed in black. 

The gorilla™s presence was detected
 by only 42% 
of observers when the attended team was the 

one dressed in white, thus replicating the previous 

˚
 ndings. However, the gorilla™s presence was 
detected by 83% of observers when the attended 

team was the one dressed in black. This shows 

the impact of similarity 
between the unexpected 

stimulus (gorilla) 
and task-relevant stimuli 
(members of attended team).
Hollingworth and Henderson (2002) assessed 
the role played by attention in change blindness. 

Eye movements were recorded while observers 

looked at a visual scene (e.g., kitchen; living 

r oom) and pressed a button if they detected any 

change in the scene. There were two possible 

kinds of change:
Type
(1) 
 change, in which the object was 
replaced by an object from a different 

category (e.g., knife replaced by fork).

ability to detect changes was supported by 

Laloyaux, Destrebecqz, and Cleeremans (2006).
 
They presented participants with an initial 

array of eight black rectangles, half vertical and 

half horizontal. In the second array of black 

rectangles, one of them might have a changed 

orientation. The third array (presented for only 

40 ms) was the same as the second one except 

that one of the rectangles (the probe) was in 

white. Participants indicated whether they had 

detected a change in orientation between the 

˚
 rst and second arrays, and whether the white 
rectangle was horizontal or vertical. Congruent 

trials were those on which the probe™s orienta-

tion matched that of the changed rectangle and 

incongruent trials were 
those with no match. 

When participants showed 
change blindness, 
they nevertheless identi˚
 ed the probe™s orienta-
tion more accurately and faster on congruent 

trials than on incongruent ones. Thus, changes 

not detected consciously can nevertheless in˜
 u-
ence conscious decisions about the orientation 

of a subsequent object.
In related research, Fernandez-Duque, Grossi, 
Thornton, and Neville 
(2003) compared event-
related potentials (ERPs; see Glossary) on trials  

in which a change in a scene was not detected 

versus trials in which there was no change. 

Undetected changes triggered a positive response 

between 240Œ300 ms, suggesting that they trigger 

certain brain processes, although they do not 

produce conscious awareness of change.
In sum, there is a danger of assuming that 
observers™ failure to report detecting a change 

in a scene means that they engaged in little or no  

processing of the changed object. As we have 

seen, several different kinds of evidence indicate 

that that assumption is often incorrect.

time prior to being changed. As can be seen in 
Figure 4.14b, the number of ˚
 xations on other 
objects occurring after the last ˚ xation on the 

to-be-changed object had no systematic effect 

on change detection. Thus, the visual representa-

tions of objects 
that are the focus of attention 

last for some time after they have been formed.
Third, as can be seen in Figures 4.14a and 
4.14b, change detection was much better when 

there was a change in the type of object rather 

than merely swapping one member of a category 

for another (token change). This makes sense 

given that type changes are more dramatic and 

obvious than token ones.
How much long-term memory do we have 
for objects ˚ xated and attended to several minutes 

earlier? Hollingworth and Henderson (2002) 

found that 93% of type changes and 81% of token 

changes were detected on a test 5Œ30 minutes 

later. Hollingworth (2004) used a ﬁfollow-the-

dotﬂ method in which observers ˚ xated a dot 

moving from object to object. On a test of change 

detection, the original object and a token change 

were presented. Change-detection performance 

was good even when 402 objects were ˚
 xated 
between the original presentation of an object 

and its second presentation.
Triesch, Ballard, Hayhoe, and Sullivan (2003) 
argued that detection of change blindness does 

not
 merely involve ˚ xating the object that is 

changed. According to them, we typically focus 
category (e.g., one knife replaced by a 

different knife).
Finally, there was a test of long-term memory 

between 5 and 30 minutes after each scene had 

been viewed. On this test, participants saw 

two scenes: (1) the original scene with a target 

"
Segment_261,"object marked with a green arrow; and (2) a   distractor scene identical to the original scene   except that there was a different object in the   location of the target object. The task was to   decide which was the original object. What did Hollingworth and Henderson  (2002) ˚ nd? First, they cons",Explores how emotion influences cognition.,"perception, awareness, recognition",Nested under Chapter on emotion,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in awareness,Aligned with contemporary studies on emotion,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_720,"object marked with a green arrow; and (2) a 

distractor scene identical to the original scene 

except that there was a different object in the 

location of the target object. The task was to 

decide which was the original object.
What did Hollingworth and Henderson 
(2002) ˚ nd? First, they considered the probability 

of reporting a change as a function of whether 

the changed object had been ˚
 xated 
prior
 to 
the change. Change detection was much greater 

when the changed object had been ˚
 xated before 
the change (see Figure 4.14a). Since observers 

mistakenly claimed to have detected a change 

on 9% of trials in which there was no change 

(false alarm rate), there was no real evidence 

that observers could accurately detect change 

in objects not ˚ xated prior to change. These 

˚
 ndings suggest that attention to the to-be-
changed object is necessary (but not suf˚
 cient) 
for change detection, because there was change 

blindness for about 60% of objects ˚
 xated 
before they were changed.
Second, Hollingworth and Henderson

, MOTION, AND ACTION 
149
It has been assumed from the outset of research 
on change blindness that attentional processes 

are important: in crude terms, we are much 

more likely to detect changes in objects attended  

to prior to change (e.g., Hollingworth & 

Henderson, 2002). However, prior attention 

to the object is often 
not
 suf˚cient when the 

change is relatively modest (i.e., a token change) 

or is not of direct relevance to an ongoing task 

(e.g., Triesch et al., 2003).
The greatest limitation of early theorising 
was the assumption that sparse visual repre-

sentations of pre-change stimuli or objects were 

important in causing change blindness. In fact, 

we typically form fairly detailed visual repre-

sentations of stimuli, but much of the detail 

becomes inaccessible unless attention is directed 

to it soon after the disappearance of the stimuli. 

Thus, our belief that we have a clear-detailed 

representation of the visual environment is 

approximately correct, but we are mistaken in 

assuming that our attention will automatically 

be drawn to important events. It has also been 

found that changes not detected at the con-

scious level can nevertheless in˜
 uence cognitive 
processing and behaviour.
these phenomena can be obtained with natu-

ralistic stimuli under naturalistic conditions 

indicates that they are of general importance, 

and their exploration has revealed much about 

the dynamics of visual perception over time.

Direct perception
¥
Gibson argued that perception and action are closely intertwined, with the main purpose
of perception being to assist in the organisation of action. According to his direct theory,

movement of an observer creates optic ˜
 ow, which provides useful information about the
direction of heading. Of particular importance are invariants, which remain the same as

individuals move around their environment, and which are detected by resonance. The

uses of objects (their affordances) were claimed to be perceived directly. Gibson™
s approach
was very original and anticipated recent theoretical ideas about a vision-for-action system.

However, he underestimated the complexity of visual processing, he minimised the importance

of stored visual knowledge when grasping objects appropriately, and he de-emphasised

those aspects of visual perception concerned with object recognition.
Visually guided action
¥
According to Gibson, our perception of heading depends on optic-˜
 ow information.
However, the retinal ˜
 ow 
˚
 eld is determined by eye and head movements as well as by
optic ˜ ow. Heading judgements are also in˜ uenced by binocular disparity and visual
direction, and optic-˜ ow information is not essential for accurate judgements. Accurate

has been argued that drivers who brake in order to stop at a target point do this by holding  

constant the rate of change of tau. However, it seems likely that they are estimating the 

constant ideal deceleration.
PlanningŒcontrol model
¥
In his planningŒcontrol model, Glover distinguished between a slow planning system used
mostly before the initiation of movement and a fast control system used during movement

execution. According to the model, planning is associated with the inferior parietal lobe,

whereas control depends on the superior parietal lobe. As predicted by the model, action

errors mostly stem from the planning system rather than the control system. There is

support for the model from neuroimaging studies and studies on brain-imaging patients.

The processes of the planning system need to be spelled out in more detail, as do the

complex interactions between the two systems.
Perception of human motion
¥
Biological motion is perceived even when only impoverished visual information is avail-
able. Perception of biological motion involves bottom-up and top-down processes. Evidence

from brain-damaged patients suggests that different brain areas are associated with

perception of biological motion and motion in general. Neuroimaging studies suggest that

the posterior superior temporal gyrus and sulcus are associated speci˚
 cally with processing
of biological motion. Our ability to perceive (and to make sense of) the movements of

other people may involve the mirror neuron system. However, the existence of such a

system in humans remains somewhat controversial.
Change blindness
¥

visual representation by a current one. However, perhaps the single most important factor

determining change blindness is whether the changed object was attended to prior to the

change. There is often very good long-term visual memory for objects that have previously

been ˚ 
xated. Change blindness is also more likely when there is only a small change in the
object and when the nature of the change is irrelevant to the individual™s ongoing task.

INTRODUCTION
Attention is invaluable in everyday life. We 

use attention to avoid being hit by cars as we 

cross the road, to search for missing objects, 

and to perform two tasks at the same time. 

Psychologists use the term ﬁattentionﬂ in several 

ways. However, attention typically refers to 

selectivity of processing, as was emphasised 

by William James (1890, pp. 403 Œ 404) many 

years ago:
Attention is . . . the taking into possession 

of the mind, in clear and vivid form, 

of one out of what seem several 

simultaneously possible objects or trains 

of thought. Focalisation, concentration, 

of consciousness are of its essence.
William James (1890) distinguished between 
ﬁactiveﬂ and ﬁpassiveﬂ modes of attention. 
Attention is active when controlled in a top-

down way by the individual™s goals or expecta-
tions but passive when controlled in a bottom-up
 
way by external stimuli (e.g., a loud noise). 

This distinction, which remains important in 

recent theorising and research (e.g., Corbetta 

& Shulman, 2002; Yantis, 2008), is discussed 

in detail later.
There is another important distinction 
between focused and divided attention. 
Focused 
attention
 (or selective attention) is studied by 

presenting individuals with two or more stimulus 

inputs at the same time and instructing them 
focused attention:
 a situation in which 
individuals try to attend to only one source of 

information while ignoring other stimuli; also 

known as selective attention.

divided attention:
 a situation in which two 

tasks are performed at the same time; also 

known as multi-tasking.
KEY TERMS
Divided attention is also known as multi-tasking; 
a skill that most of us regard as important in 

today™s hectic world.

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
Cherry also carried out studies in which 
one auditory message was shadowed (i.e., 
repeated back out loud) while a second audi-

tory message was played to the other ear. Very 

little information seemed to be extracted from 

the second or non-attended message. Listeners 

seldom noticed when that message was spoken 

in a foreign language or reversed speech. In 

contrast, physical changes (e.g., a pure tone) 

were nearly always detected. The conclusion 

that unattended auditory information receives 

practically no processing was supported by 

˚
 nding there was very little memory for un-
attended words even when presented 35 times 

each (Moray, 1959).
Broadbent™s theory
Broadbent (1958) argued that the ˚
 ndings from 
the shadowing task were important. He was 

also impressed by data from a memory task 

in which three pairs of digits were presented 

dichotically. On this task, three digits were 

presented one after the other to one ear at the 

same time as three different digits were pre-

sented to the other ear. Most participants chose 

to recall the digits ear by ear rather than pair 

by pair. Thus, if 496 were presented to one 

ear and 852 to the other ear, recall would be 

496852 rather than 489562.
Broadbent (1958) accounted for the various 
˚
 ndings as follows (see Figure 5.1):
Two stimuli or messages presented at the
†
same time gain access in parallel (at the

same time) to a sensory buffer.

One of the inputs is then allowed through
†
a ˚ 
lter on the basis of its physical charac-
teristics, with the other input remaining in

the buffer for later processing.

This ˚ 
lter prevents overloading of the limited-
†
capacity mechanism beyond the ˚
 lter, which
processes the input thoroughly (e.g., in terms

of its meaning).

Divided attention is also known as multi

a skill that is increasingly important in today™s 

24/ 7 world! Studies of divided attention or 

multi-tasking provide useful information about 

an individual™s processing limitations. They also  

tell us something about attentional mechanisms 

and their capacity.
Much attentional research suffers from two 
limitations. First, we can attend to the external 

environment (e.g., our friend walking towards 

us) or to the internal environment (e.g., our 

plans for tomorrow). However, there has been 

far more research on the former than on the 

latter because it is much easier to identify and 

control environmental stimuli.
Second, what we attend to in the real world 
is largely determined by our current goals and 

emotional states. In most research, however, 

what people attend to is determined by the 

experimenter™s instructions rather than their 

own motivational or emotional states. Some 

exceptions are discussed in Chapter 15.
Two important topics related to attention 
are discussed in other chapters. The phenom-

enon of change blindness, which shows the close 

links between attention and perception, is con-

sidered in Chapter 4. Consciousness (including 

its relationship to attention) is discussed in 

Chapter 16.
FOCUSED AUDITORY 
ATTENTION
The British scientist Colin Cherry became 
fascinated by the ﬁcocktail partyﬂ problem, 

i.e., how can we follow just one conversation

when several people are talking at once? Cherry 

(1953) found that this ability involved using 

physical differences (e.g., sex of speaker; 

voice intensity; speaker location) to maintain 

atten
tion to a chosen auditory message. When 

Cherry presented two messages in the same 

voice to both ears at once (thus eliminating 

these physical differences), listeners found it 

hard to separate out the two messages on the 
"
Segment_270,"basis of meaning alone. 9781841695402_4_005.indd   154 9781841695402_4_005.indd   154 12/21/09   2:16:01 PM  12/21/09   2:16:01 PM  5  ATTENTION  AND PERFORMANCE 155 torily presented messages was combined with  auditory presentation of words, memory for the   words was very poor.

torily presented messages was combined with 
auditory presentation of words, memory for the 

words was very poor. However, when shadow-

ing was combined with picture presentation, 

memory for the pictures was very good (90% 

correct). If two inputs are dissimilar, they can 

both be processed more fully than assumed by 

Broadbent.
In the early studies, it was assumed there 
was no processing of the meaning of unattended  

messages because the participants had no con-

scious awareness of hearing them. However, 

meaning can be processed without awareness. 

Von Wright, Anderson, and Stenman (1975) 

presented two lists of words auditorily, with 

instructions to shadow one list and ignore 

the other. When a word previously associated 

with electric shock was presented on the non-

attended list, there was sometimes a physio-

logical reaction (galvanic skin response). The 

same effect was produced by presenting a word 

very similar in sound or meaning to the shocked 

word. Thus, information on the unattended 
It also accounts for performance on Broad-

bent™s dichotic task. The ˚
 lter selects one input 
onthe basis of the most prominent physical 

characteristic(s) distinguishing the two inputs 

(i.e., the ear of arrival). However, the assump-

tion that the unattended message is typically 

rejected at an early stage of processing (unless 

attended to rapidly) is dubious. The original 

shadowing experiments used participants with 

very little experience of shadowing messages, 

so nearly all their available processing resources 

had to be allocated to shadowing. Underwood 

(1974) found that naïve participants detected 

only 8% of the digits on the non-shadowed 

message but an experienced researcher in the 

area (Neville Moray) detected 67%.

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
In spite of these various problems with 
Broadbent™s theory, it has recently received 
reasonable support in research by Lachter, 

Forster, and Ruthruff (2004). We will consider 

their research a little later.
Alternative theories
Treisman (1960) found with the shadowing 

task that participants sometimes said a word 

that had been presented on the unattended 

channel. Such ﬁbreakthroughsﬂ typically occurred 

when the word on the unattended channel was 

highly probable in the context of the attended 

message. Even in those circumstances, however, 

Treisman only observed breakthrough on 6% 

of trials. Such ˚
 ndings led Treisman (1964) 
to argue that the ˚ lter reduces or attenuates 

the analysis of unattended information (see 

Figure 5.1). Treisman claimed that the location 

of the bottleneck was more ˜ exible than Broad-

bent had suggested. She proposed that stimulus 

analysis proceeds systematically through a hier-

archy, starting with analyses based on physical 

cues, syllable pattern and speci˚ c words, and 

moving on to analyses based on grammatical 

structure and meaning. If there is insuf˚
 cient 
processing capacity to permit "
Segment_272,"full stimulus   analysis, tests towards the top of the hierarchy   are omitted. Treisman (1964) argued that the thresholds  of all stimuli (e.g., words) consistent with current   expectations are lowered.

analysis, tests towards the top of the hierarchy 

are omitted.
Treisman (1964) argued that the thresholds 
of all stimuli (e.g., words) consistent with current 

expectations are lowered. As a result, partially 

processed stimuli on the unattended channel 

sometimes exceed the threshold of conscious 

awareness. This aspect of the theory helps to 

account for breakthrough.
Treisman™s theory accounted for the exten-
sive processing of unattended sources of infor-

mation that was embarrassing for Broadbent. 

However, the same facts were also explained 

by Deutsch and Deutsch (1963). They argued 

that all stimuli are fully analysed, with the most

response (see Figure 5.1). This theory places 

the bottleneck in processing much nearer the 

response end of the processing system than 

Treisman™s attenuation theory.
message was sometimes processed for sound 

and meaning even though the participants 

were not consciously aware that a word related 

to the previously shocked word had been 

presented.
When the participant™s own name is presented 
on the unattended message, about one-third 

of them report hearing it (Moray, 1959). This 

˚
 nding is hard to account for in Broadbent™s 
theory. Conway, Cowan, and Bunting (2001) 

found the probability of detecting one™s own 

name on the unattended message depended 

on individual differences in working memory 

capacity (see Chapter 6). Individuals with low 

working memory capacity were more likely 

than those with high working memory capacity 

to detect their own name (65% versus 20%, 

respectively). This probably occurred because 

those low in working memory capacity are less 

able to control their focus of attention and so 

ignore the unattended message. This interpreta-

tion was supported by Col˜ esh and Conway 

(2007). Participants shadowed one message 

but were told 
explicitly
 to try to detect their 

own name in the other message"

Evaluation
Broadbent (1958) proposed a somewhat 
inß
 exible
 
system of selective attention, which apparently 

cannot account for the great variability in the 

amount of analysis of the non-shadowed message. 

The same in˜
exibility of the ˚lter theory is 
shown 
in its assumption that the ˚
 lter selects 
information on the basis of physical features. 

This assumption is supported by people™s tend-

ency to recall dichotically presented digits ear 

by ear. However, Gray and Wedderburn (1960) 

used a version of the dichotic task in which 

ﬁWho 6 there?ﬂ might be presented to one ear 

as ﬁ4 goes 1ﬂ was presented to the other ear. 

The preferred order of report was determined 

by meaning (e.g., ﬁWho goes there?ﬂ followed 

by ﬁ4 6 1ﬂ). The fact that selection can be 

based on the meaning of presented information 

is inconsistent with ˚
 lter theory.

was pessimistic about the possibility of doing 
that because he believed it took 500 ms to shift 

attention. In fact, involuntary shifts of attention 

can occur in 50 ms (Tsal, 1983). The crucial 

point is that shifting attention to information 

in a sensory buffer can be 
almost as effective as  
shifting attention t o  
the actual object.
We now have 
two
 contrasting explana-
tions for the occasional semantic processing of 

ﬁunattendedﬂ stimuli. According to Treisman, 

this depends on a leaky ˚ lter. According to 

Broadbent™s modi˚ ed theory, it depends on 

what Lachter et al. (2004) called ﬁslippageﬂ, 

meaning that attention is shifted to allegedly 

ﬁunattendedﬂ stimuli so they are not really 

unattended.
Slippage may be more important than 
leakage. Von Wright et al. (1975), in a study

the ﬁunattendedﬂ message. Dawson and Schell 

(1982) replicated that ˚
 nding, but most of the 
enhanced physiological responses occurred on 

trials in which it seemed likely that listeners 

had shifted attention.
Lachter et al. (2004) tested the slippage 
account. They used a lexical-decision task in 

which participants decided whether a letter 

string formed a word. This letter string was 

immediately preceded by a prime word the 

same as (or unrelated to) the target word 

presented for lexical decision. In the crucial 

condition, this prime word was presented for 

55 ms, 110 ms, or 165 ms to the unattended 

location. According to the slippage account, 

participants would need to shift attention to 

the ﬁunattendedﬂ prime to show a priming 

effect. Since attentional shifting takes at least 

50 ms, there should be no priming effect 

when the prime word was presented for 55 ms. 

However, there should be a priming effect 

when it was presented for 110 ms or 165 ms 

because that would give suf˚cient time for 

attention to shift. That is precisely what 

happened. Thus, there was no evidence that 

the ﬁunattendedﬂ prime word was processed 

when stringent steps were taken to prevent 

slippage but not to prevent leakage.
Treisman and Riley (1969) had parti-
ci pants shadow one of two auditory messages, 

but they were told to stop shadowing and 

to tap when they detected a target in either 

message. According to Treisman™s theory, there 

should be attenuated processing of the non-

shadowed message and so fewer targets should 

be detected on that message. According to 

Deutsch and Deutsch (1963), there is complete 

perceptual analysis of all stimuli, and so there 

should be no difference in detection rates 

between the two messages. In fact, many more 

target words were detected on the shadowed 

message.
Neurophysiological studies provide evidence 
against Deutsch and Deutsch™s theory (see"
Segment_275,"Lachter    et al., 2004, for a review). Coch, Sanders, and   Neville (2005) used a dichotic listening task in   which participants attended to one of two audi-  tory messages. Their task was to detect probe   targets presented on the attended or unattended   message. Event-related potentials (ERPs;",Explores how awareness influences cognition.,"emotion, awareness, memory",Nested under Chapter on memory,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in attention,Aligned with contemporary studies on recognition,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_447," Lachter  

et al., 2004, for a review). Coch, Sanders, and 

Neville (2005) used a dichotic listening task in 

which participants attended to one of two audi-

tory messages. Their task was to detect probe 

targets presented on the attended or unattended 

message. Event-related potentials (ERPs; see 

Glossary) were recorded. ERPs 100 ms after 

probe presentation were greater when the probe 

was presented on the attended message than 

the unattended one, suggesting there was more 

processing of attended than of unattended 

probes. No difference in these ERPs would 

be the natural prediction from Deutsch and 

Deutsch™s theory.
Broadbent returns!
The evidence discussed so far suggests that 

Deutsch and Deutsch™s theory is the least 

adequate of the three theories and Treisman™s 

theory the most adequate. However, we must 

not dismiss Broadbent™s approach too readily. 

Broadbent argued that there is a sensory buffer 

or immediate memory that brie˜y holds rela-

tively unprocessed information. We now know 

that there are separate sensory buffers for the 

auditory modality (echoic memory) and the 

visual modality (iconic memory) (see Chapter 

6). If we could switch our attention rapidly 

to the information in the appropriate sensory 

buffer, we would be able to process ﬁun-

attendedﬂ stimuli thoroughly. Broadbent (1958)

Several theorists (e.g., Corbetta & Shulman,

Posner (1980) carried out classic research in 
this area. His research involved 
covert attention
, 

in which attention shifts to a given spatial 

location in the absence of an eye movement. 

In his studies, participants responded as rapidly 

as possible when they detected the onset of 

a light. Shortly before light onset, they were 

presented with a central cue (arrow pointing 

to the left or right) or a peripheral cue (brief 

illumination of a box outline). These cues 

were mostly valid (i.e., they indicated accurately 

where the target light would appear), but 

sometimes were invalid (i.e., they provided 

inaccurate infor mation about the location of 

the target light).
What did Posner (1980) ˚ nd? Valid cues 
produced faster responding to light onset than 

did neutral cues (a central cross), whereas 

invalid cues produced slower responding than 

neutral cues. The ˚
 ndings were comparable for 
central and peripheral cues, and were obtained 

in the absence of eye movements. When the 

cues were valid on only a small fraction of trials, 

they were ignored when they were central cues. 

However, they affected performance when they 

were peripheral cues.
Evaluation
The three theories discussed in this section have 

all been very in˜ uential in the development of 

our understanding of focused auditory attention.  

Much of the evidence indicates that there is 

reduced processing of unattended stimuli com-

pared to attended ones and is thus consistent 

with Treisman™s theoretical approach. However, 

Lachter et al.™s (2004) research has revived 

interest in Broadbent™s approach. Later in the 

chapter we discuss a theory put forward by 

Lavie (e.g., 2005). She argued that sometimes 

there is early selection (as claimed by Broadbent,  

1958) and sometimes there is late selection (as 

claimed by Deutsch and Deutsch, 1963).
What are the limitations of research in this 
area? First, it is very hard to control the onset

FOCUSED VISUAL 
ATTENTION
Over the past 30 years or so, most researchers 
have studied visual rather than auditory atten-

tion. Why is this? There are several reasons. 

First, vision is probably our most important 

sense modality, with more of the cortex devoted  

to vision than to any other sensory modality. 

Second, it is easier to control precisely the 

presentation times of visual stimuli than audi-

tory stimuli. Third, we can explore a wider 

range of issues in the visual than in the auditory 

modality.
There are more studies on focused visual 
attention than you can shake a stick at. Accord-

ingly, we will consider only a few key issues. 

First, what are the major systems involved in 
covert attention:
 attention to an object or 
sound in the absence of overt movements of 

the relevant receptors (e.g., looking at an object 

in the periphery of vision without moving one™s 

eyes).

Corbetta and Shulman also identi˚
 ed a 
stimulus-driven or bottom-up system (the ventral 
network) resembling Posner™s exogenous system. 

This system is used when an unexpected and 

potentially important stimulus (e.g., ˜
 ames 
appearing under the door of your room) is 

presented. This system has a ﬁcircuit-breakingﬂ 

function, meaning that visual attention is re-

directed from its current focus. According to 

Corbetta and Shulman, this system consists 

of a right-hemisph"

The goal-directed (dorsal network) and 
stimulus-driven (ventral network) systems often

 uence and interact with each other. According 
to Corbetta and Shulman (2002), connections 

between the temporo-parietal junction and 

the intraparietal sulcus interrupt goal-directed 

attention when unexpected stimuli are detected. 

More speci˚ cally, information concerning the 

signi˚
 cance of unexpected stimuli passes from 
the intraparietal sulcus to the temporo-parietal 

junction.
The above ˚ ndings led Posner (1980) to 
distinguish between two systems:
An 
(1) 
endogenous system
: This is controlled 
by the individual™s intentions and expecta-

tions, and is involved when peripheral cues
 
are presented.

An
(2) 
 
exogenous system
: This system auto-
matically shifts attention and is involved 

when uninformative peripheral cues are 

presented. Stimuli that are salient or that 

differ from other stimuli (e.g., in colour; 

in motion) are most likely to be attended 

to via this system (Beck & Kastner, 2005).
Corbetta and Shulman (2002) identi˚
 ed a 
goal-directed or top-down attentional system 

(the dorsal network) resembling Posner™
s endo-
genous system and consisting of a dorsal 

fronto-parietal network (see Figure 5.2). The 

functioning of this system is in˜
 uenced by 
expectations, knowledge, and current goals. 

Thus, this system is involved if people are given 

a cue predicting the location, motion, or other 

characteristic of a forthcoming visual stimulus.

Corbetta and Shulman (2002). First, the tasks 
used to assess the brain areas activated by 

the goal-directed attentional system generally 

differed from those used to assess activation 

associated with the stimulus-driven system. 

Second, most studies considered only one of 

the attentional systems and so failed to provide 

direct 
comparisons
 of patterns of brain activation 
in the two systems.
Hahn, Ross, and Stein (2006) attempted to 
eliminate these problems. Participants ˚
 xated 
a central circle and then detected a target pre-

sented to any of four peripheral locations. Cues  

varying in how informative they were concerning 

the location of the next target were presented 

in the central circle. It was assumed that top-

down processes would be used most extensively 

when the cue was very informative. In contrast, 

bottom-up processes would occur 
after
 the 

target stimulus had been presented, and would 

be most used when the cue was relatively 

uninformative.
What did Hahn et al. (2006) discover? First, 
there was practically no overlap in the

that the ventral network has a ﬁcircuit-breakingﬂ

breaking? The most obvious answer is that 

salient or distinctive stimuli attract attention 

to themselves. However, Corbetta et al. disputed 

that answer, claiming that 
task-relevant
 stimuli 

are much more likely to attract attention from 

the ventral network than are salient or distinc-

tive stimuli. We will shortly discuss the relevant 

evidence.
Evidence
Corbetta and Shulman (2002) carried out meta-

analyses of brain-imaging studies on the goal-

directed system (dorsal network). The brain 

areas most often activated while individuals 

expect a stimulus that has not yet been presented 

are the posterior intraparietal sulcus (pIPs), the 

superior parietal lobule (SPL), the postcentral 

sulcus (PoCes), and precentral sulcus (PrCes), and 

the superior frontal sulcus (SFs) (see Figure 5.2). 

Somewhat different areas were activated from 

one study to the n"

(1999) study,  and they expected",Explores how awareness influences cognition.,"awareness, memory, recognition",Nested under Chapter on attention,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in awareness,Aligned with contemporary studies on memory,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_1385,"ext, presumably because 
what
 
participants expected varied across studies. 

They expected a stimulus at a given location in  

the Corbetta et al. (2000) and Hop˚ nger et al. 

(2000) 
studies, they expected a given direction  
of motion i n  
the Shulman et al. (1999) study, 
and they expected 
a complex visual array in 

the Kastner (1999) 
study.
Corbetta and Shulman (2002) also carried 
out a meta-analysis of brain studies in which 

participants detected low-frequency targets using 

the stimulus-driven system (ventral network). 

The brain areas in this attentional network 

include the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), 

the intraparietal sulcus (IPs), the frontal eye 

˚
 eld (FEF), and the middle frontal gyrus (Mfg) 
(see Figure 5.3). There was substantial overlap 

in the brain areas activated across studies, 

especially in areas like the temporo-parietal 

junction. Note that activation was mainly pre-

sent in the
 right
 hemisphere in all the studies 

contributing to the meta-analysis.
There are two reasons why it is somewhat 
dif˚
 cult to interpret the evidence reported by

somewhat separate ventral and dorsal attention 
systems. This notion also receives support from 

research on neglect patients, who have damage 

primarily to the stimulus-driven system. In 

addition, the hypothesis that the stimulus-driven  

system is more responsive to task-relevant 

than to salient distractors has been supported 

empirically.
What are the limitations of this theoretical 
approach? First, we know little about how the 

two visual attention systems interact. Light will 

be shed on this issue if we can obtain more 

detailed information about the timing of activa-

tion in each system in various situations. Second,  

attentional processes are involved in the 

performance of numerous tasks. It is unlikely 

that all"

(2002) attention systems. Third, attentional pro-

cesses are in˜ uenced by several substances such 

asadrenaline, noradrenaline, and dopamine 

(Corbetta et al., 2008). However, 
how
 these 

substances in˜ uence the two attention systems 

is unclear.
Spotlight, zoom-lens, or multiple 
spotlights?
What is focused visual attention like? You may 
well agree with Posner (1980) and others that 

it is like a spotlight. Thus, visual attention 

illuminates a small part of the visual space 

around you, little can be seen outside its beam, 

and it can be redirected ˜ exibly to focus on any 

object of interest. Eriksen and St. James (1986) 

developed the spotlight notion in their zoom-

lens model, in which they compared focused 

attention to a zoom lens. They argued that we 

can increase or decrease the area of focal atten-

tion at will, just as a zoom lens can be adjusted. 

This certainly makes sense. For example, when 

driving a car it is gen erally a good idea to 

attend to as much of the visual ˚
 eld as possible 
to anticipate danger. However, when drivers 

detect a potential hazard, they focus speci˚
 cally 
on it to avoid having a crash.
LaBerge (1983) reported ˚
 ndings support-
ing the zoom-lens model. Five-letter words 
areas (e.g., V1) and on perceptual performance. 

Such ˚ndings strengthen the case for claiming 

that the ventral system in˜ uences attention in 

a top-down fashion.
Most patients with persistent neglect ignore 
or neglect visual stimuli presented to the left 

side of the visual ˚ eld. According to Corbetta 

et al. (2008), this occurs because they have 

suffered damage to the stimulus-driven system. 

As we will see later, neglect patients vary in the 

areas of brain damage. However, the stimulus-

driven system (especially the temporo-parietal 

junction) is typically damaged, and so the ˚
 nd-
ings from neglect patients provide support for

driven attention is captured more by distractors 

resembling task-relevant stimuli than by salient 

or distinctive distractor stimuli was reported 

by Folk, Remington, and Johnston (1992). 

They used targets de˚ ned by colour or abrupt 

onset and the same was true of the distractors. 

When the participants looked for abrupt-onset 

targets, abrupt-onset distractors captured atten-

tion but colour 
distractors did not. In contrast, 
when the participants looked for colour targets, 

colour distractors captured attention but abrupt-

onset distractors did not.
Indovina and Macaluso (2007) used func-
tional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI; see 

Glossary) to assess the effects of different types 

of distractor on activation within the stimulus-

driven system or ventral network. Participants 

reported the orientation of a coloured letter 

T in the presence of a letter T in a different 

colour (task-relevant distractor) or a ˜
 ickering 
draughtboard (salient distractor). The ventral 

network (e.g., the temporo-parietal junction) 

was activated by task-relevant distractors but 

not by salient ones.

Corbetta and Shulman (2002) and Corbetta

Brandt (2003) also supported the zoom-lens 

theory. On each trial, participants were pre-

sented with four squares in a semi-circle. They 

were cued to focus their attention on one spe-

ci˚
c square, or two speci˚c squares, or on all 
four squares. After that, four objects were pre-

sented (one in each square), and participants 

decided whether a target (e.g., white circle) 

was among them. When a target was present, 

it was always in one of the cued squares. 

Müller et al. used functional magnetic resonance 

imaging (fMRI; see Glossary) to assess brain 

activation.
There were two key ˚
 ndings. First, as pre-
dicted by the zoom-lens theory, targets were 

detected fastest when the attended region was 

small (i.e., only one square) and slowest when 

it was large (i.e., all four squares). Second, 

activation in early visual areas was most wide-

spread when the attended region was large and 

was most limited when the attended region 

was small (see Figure 5.5). This ˚
 nding supports 
were presented, and a probe requiring a rapid 

response was occasionally presented instead of 

(or immediately after) the word. This probe 

could appear in the spatial position of any of 

the ˚ ve letters. In one condition, an attempt 

was made to focus participants™ attention on 

the middle letter of the ˚ ve-letter word by 

asking them to categorise that letter. In another 

condition, participants categorised the entire 

word. It was expected that this would lead 

them to adopt a broader attentional beam.

is assumed that we can show 
split attention
, 
in which attention is directed to two or more 

regions of space 
not
 adjacent to each other. 

Split attention could save 
process
ing resources 

because we would avoid 
attending to irrelevant 
regions of visual space lying between two 

relevant areas.
Evidence of split attention was reported 
by Awh and Pashler (2000). Participants were 

presented with a 5 
×
 5 visual display containing 
23 letters and two digits, and reported the 

identity of the two digits. Just before 
the display 

was presented, participants were given two 

cues indicating the probable locations of the 

two digits. These cues were invalid on 20% of 

trials. Part of what was involved is shown in 

Figure 5.6a. The crucial condition 
was one in 

which the cues were invalid, with one of the 

digits being presented in between the cued 

locations (the near location).
How good would we expect performance 
to be for a digit presented 
between 
the two 
cued locations? If the spotlight or zoom-lens 

theory is correct, focal attention should include  

the two cued locations 
and
 the space in between.  

In that case, performance should have been 

high for that digit because it would have 

received full attention. If the multiple spotlights 

theory is correct, performance should have 

been poor for that digit because only the cued 

locations would have received full attention. 

In fact, performance was much lower for digits 

presented 
between
 cued locations than for digits 
presented 
at
 cued locations (see Figure 5.6b). 
Thus, attention can apparently be shaped like 

a doughnut with nothing in the middle.

given that visual 
perception is mainly concerned 

with speci˚ c objects of interest to us (see Chapters 

2 and 3). Third, our processing system may be 

so ˜ exible that we can attend to an area of space

ities in turn. Note, however, that it is hard to

attention to an object given that any object has

who typically fail to attend to stimuli presented 
to the left visual ˚ eld. Marshall and Halligan 

(1994) presented a neglect patient with ambi-

g uous displays that could be seen as a black shape 

against a white background or a white shape 

on a black background. There was a jagged edge 

dividing the two shapes at the centre of each 

display. The patient copied this jagged edge 

when drawing the shape on the left side of the 

display, but could not copy exactly the same 

edge when drawing the shape on the right side. 

Thus, the patient attended to objects rather than 

simply to a region of visual space.

It is also relevant that the   grouping processes (e.g., law of similarity; law   of proximity) occurring relatively early in visual   perception help to segregate the visual environ-  ment into ˚  gure (central object) and ground  (see Chapter 2). However, attention can also",Explores how emotion influences cognition.,"attention, memory, perception",Nested under Chapter on awareness,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in memory,Aligned with contemporary studies on recognition,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_347," in

grouping processes (e.g., law of similarity; law 

of proximity) occurring relatively early in visual
 
perception help to segregate the visual environ-

ment into ˚
 gure (central object) and ground 
(see Chapter 2). However, attention can also 

be location-based.
Location- and object-based attention
Egly, Driver, and Rafal (1994) found evidence 

for both location- and object-based attention. 

They used displays like those shown in Figure 5.7. 

The task was to detect a target stimulus as 

rapidly as possible. A cue was presented be-

fore the target, and this cue was valid (same 

location as the target) or invalid (different loca-

tion from target). Of key importance, invalid 

cues were in the same object as the target 

or in a different object. Target detection was 

slower on invalid trials than on valid trials. 

On invalid trials, target detection was slower 

when the cue was in a different object, sug-

gesting that attention was at least partially 

object-based. Egly et al. (1994) used the same 

displays to test patients suffering from brain 

damage to the right parietal area. When the 

cue was presented to the same side as the brain 

damage but the target was presented to the 

opposite side, the patients showed considerable  

slowing of target detection. This occurred  
the right, and indicated the orientation of the 

one in a given colour. Each oval was super-

imposed on a task-irrelevant face or house. They 

made use of the fact that the fusiform face area 

is selectively activated when faces are processed, 

whereas the parahippocampal place area is 

selectively activated when houses are processed. 

As predicted on the assumption that attention 

is location-based, fMRI indicated that there 

was more processing of the stimulus super-

imposed on the attended oval than of the stimulus 

superimposed on the unattended oval.

rather than a particular region of space. Neisser  

and Becklen (1975) superimposed two moving 

scenes on top of each other. Their participants 

could easily attend to one scene while ignoring 

the other. These ˚ ndings suggest that objects 

can be the main focus of visual attention.
O™Craven, Downing, and Kanwisher (1999) 
presented participants with two stimuli (a face 

and a house) transparently overlapping at the 

same location, with one of the objects moving 

slightly. Participants attended to the direction 

of motion of the moving stimulus or the position 

of the stationary stimulus. Suppose attention 

is location-based. In that case, participants 

would have to attend to both stimuli, because 

they were both in the same location. In contrast, 

suppose attention is object-based. In that case, 

processing of the attended stimulus should 

be more thorough than processing of the 

unattended stimulus.
O™Craven et al. (1999) tested the above 
competing predictions by using fMRI to assess 

activity in brain areas involved in processing 

faces (fusiform face area) or houses (parahippo-

campal place area). There was more activity 

in the fusiform face area when the face stimulus 

was attended than unattended, and more activity  

in the parahippocampal place area when the 

house stimulus was attended than unattended. 

Thus, attention was object- rather than location-

based.
There is evidence for object-based selection 
from studies on patients with persistent neglect,

was of much greater magnitude, and was found 

consistently.
Leek, Reppa, and Tipper (2003) argued 
that object-based and location-based inhibition 

of return both exist. Thus, the magnitude of 

the inhibitory effect in standard conditions 

(with an object present) is a 
combination
 of 

location- and object-based inhibition of return. 
because 
they had impairment of the location-
based component 
of visual attention and so 
could not switch attention 
rapidly from one 
part of visual space to another.
When we are searching the visual environ-
ment, it would be inef˚ cient if we repeatedly 

attended to any given location. This could 

be avoided if we possess inhibitory processes 

reducing the probability of that happening. 

Of direct relevance here is the phenomenon 

of 
inhibition of return
, ﬁa reduced perceptual 
priority for information in a region that re-

cently enjoyed a higher priorityﬂ (Samuel & 

Kat, 2003, p. 897). A central issue is whether 

inhibition of return applies to locations or to 

objects.
Posner and Cohen (1984) provided the 
original demonstration of inhibition of return. 

There were two boxes, one on each side of 

the ˚ xation point. An uninformative cue was 

presented in one of the boxes (e.g., its outline 

brightened). This was followed by a target 

stimulus (e.g., an asterisk) in one of the boxes, 

with the participant™s task being to respond 

as rapidly as possible when it was detected. 

When the time interval between cue and target 

was under 300 ms, targets in the cued location 

were detected faster than those in the non-cued 

location. However, when the time interval 

exceeded 300 ms, there was inhibition of return

separate blocks to the faces or to the houses, 

with the other type of stimulus being un-

attended. Activity in the fusiform face area that 

responds selectively to faces was signi˚
 cantly 
greater when the faces were attended than 

when they were not. However, there was still 

some activity within the fusiform face area in 

response to unattended faces.
Evidence that there can be more processing 
of unattended visual stimuli than initially seems 

to be the case was reported by McGlinchey-

Berroth, Milber, Verfaellie, Alexander, and 

Kilduff (1993). Neglect patients (who typically 

ignore visual stimuli presented to the left visual 

˚
 eld) decided which of two drawings matched 
a drawing presented immediately beforehand 

to the left or the right visual ˚ eld. The patients 

performed well when the initial drawing was 

presented to the right visual ˚
 eld but at chance 
level when presented to the left visual ˚
 eld (see 
Figure 5.8a). The latter ˚ nding suggests that the 

stimuli in the left visual ˚ eld were not processed. 

In a second study, however, neglect patients 

decided whether letter strings formed words.

This effect was the same size regardless of 

whether the object was presented to 
the left or  
the right visual ˚ eld (see Figure 5.8b),  
indicating 
that there was some semantic 
processing of 

left-˚
 eld stimuli by neglect patients.
We saw earlier that task-relevant dis 
tracting 
stimuli are often more disruptive of task per-

formance than salient or distinctive dis 
tractors 
(e.g., Folk et al., 1992). However, other factors 

are also important in determin ing whether we can 

maintain our attentional focus on the task in hand. 

Lavie (e.g., 2005) developed a theory in which 

the emphasis is on two major assumptions:
Susceptibility to distraction is greater 
(1) 
when the task involves low 
perceptual
 

load
 than when it involves high perceptual 

load. Perceptual load depends on factors 

such as the number of task stimuli that 

need to be perceived or the processing 
Leek et al. compared inhibition of return under 

conditions in which an object was absent
 
or present. They expected to ˚ nd that the 

inhi
bitory effect would be stronger in the 

stand 
ard condition (location-based 
+
 object-
based inhibition) than in a condition in which 

the object was absent. That is precisely what 

they found.
What underlies inhibition of return? Two 
main answers have been suggested: inhibition 

of perceptual/attentional processes and inhibi-

tion of motor processes. The ˚ ndings have been 

inconsistent. Prime and Ward (2004) used event-

related potentials (ERPs; see Glossary) to clarify 

the processes involved in inhibition of return. 

Early visual processing of targets presented to 

the location previously cued was reduced (or 

inhibited) compared to that of targets presented 

to a different location. In contrast, the ERP 

evidence failed to indicate any difference in 

motor processes between the two types of target. 

However, Pastötter, Hanslmayr, and Bäuml 

(2008) found, using EEG, "
Segment_293,"that response inhibi-  tion was important in producing inhibition of   return. Finally, Tian and Yao (2008) found,   using ERPs, that ﬁboth sensory inhibition pro-  cesses and res ponse inhibition processes are   involved in the behavioural IOR (inhibition of   return) effectﬂ (p. 177). In sum, visu",Explores how perception influences cognition.,"attention, memory, awareness",Nested under Chapter on perception,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in attention,Aligned with contemporary studies on recognition,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_173,"that response inhibi-

using ERPs, that ﬁboth sensory inhibition pro-

cesses and res ponse inhibition processes are 

involved in the behavioural IOR (inhibition of

In sum, visual attention can be object- or 
location-based, and so can be used ˜
 exibly. 
In similar fashion, inhibition of return can be 

object- or location-based, although some evid-

ence(e.g., List & Robertson, 2007) suggests 

that location-based inhibition effects are gener-

ally stronger. Presumably the individual™s goals 

determine whether visual attention is focused 

on objects or locations, but the precise processes 

involved remain unclear.
What happens to unattended 
visual stimuli?
Not surprisingly, unattended stimuli receive less 
processing than attended ones. For example,

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
Most of the evidence supports this theory. 
Lavie (1995) carried out an experiment in which 
participants detected a target letter (an ﬁxﬂ or a  

ﬁzﬂ) appearing in one of six positions arranged 

in a row. In the high perceptual-load condition,  

the other ˚ ve positions were occupied by non-

target letters, whereas none of those positions was 

occupied in the low perceptual load condition. 

Finally, a large distractor letter was also presented. 

On some trials, it was incompatible (i.e., it was 

ﬁxﬂ when the target was ﬁzﬂ or vice versa) and 

on other trials it was neutral. According to the 

theory, the nature of the distractor should have 

more effect on time to identify target stimuli when 

perceptual load is low than when it is high. That 

is precisely what happened (see Figure 5.9).
Forster and Lavie (2008) pointed out that 
people"
Segment_294,"in everyday life are often distracted by   stimuli obviously irrelevant to their current   task. For example, more than 10% of drivers   hospitalised after car accidents reported that   they had been distracted by irrelevant stimuli   such as a person outside the car or an insect   inside it (McEvo",Explores how recognition influences cognition.,"attention, memory, emotion",Nested under Chapter on attention,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in perception,Aligned with contemporary studies on awareness,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_203," in everyday life are often distracted by 

stimuli obviously irrelevant to their current 

task. For example, more than 10% of drivers 

hospitalised after car accidents reported that 

they had been distracted by irrelevant stimuli 

such as a person outside the car or an insect 

inside it (McEvoy, Stevenson, & Woodward, 

2007). Participants searched for a target letter 

and the distractor was another letter or a cartoon  

character (e.g., Mickey Mouse; Donald Duck). 

There were two key ˚ ndings. First, the com-

pletely task-irrelevant distractors interfered with 

task performance as much as the task-relevant 

distractors. Second, the interfering effects of 

both kinds of distractor were eliminated when 

there was high perceptual load on the task.
Neuroimaging studies have provided addi-
tional evidence of the importance of perceptual 

load. Schwartz, Vuilleumier, Hutton, Marouta, 

Dolan, and Driver (2005) assessed brain acti-

vation to distractor ˜
 ickering draughtboards 
while participants carried out a task involving 

low or high perceptual load. As predicted, 

the draughtboard distractors produced less 

activation in several brain areas related to visual  

processing (e.g., V1, V2, and V3) when there 

was high perceptual load (see Figure 5.10).
The prediction that the effects of distractors 
should be more disruptive when the load on 

working memory is high than when it is low, 

was tested by de Fockert, Rees, Frith, and Lavie 
demands of each stimulus. The argument 

is that, ﬁHigh perceptual load that engages 

full capacity in relevant processing would 

leave no spare capacity for perception of 

task-irrelevant stimuliﬂ (p. 75).

Susceptibility to distraction is greater 
(2) 
when there is a high load on 
executive 

cognitive control functions
 (e.g., working 
memory) than when there is a low load. 

The reason for this assumption is that, 

ﬁCognitive control is needed for actively 

maintaining the distinction between targets

Here, we consider two of the main attentional 

disorders: neglect and extinction. 
Neglect
 (or 

unilateral neglect) is a condition in which there 

is a lack of awareness of stimuli presented t"

the side of space on the opposite side of the 

brain (the contralesional side). In the great 

majority of cases of persistent neglect, the brain 

damage is in the right hemisphere (involving 

the inferior parietal lobe), and there is little 

awareness of stimuli on the left side of the 

visual ˚ eld. This occurs because of the nature 

of the visual system, with information from 

the left side of the visual ˚ eld proceeding to 

the right hemisphere of the brain. When neglect 

patients draw an object or copy a drawing, 

they typically leave out most of the details from 

the left side of it (see Figure 5.11).
(2001). Participants classi˚ ed famous written 

names as pop stars or politicians under con-

ditions of low or high working memory load 

(involving remembering strings of digits). Dis-

traction was provided by famous faces. Task 

performance was more adversely affected by 

the distracting faces when there was high work-

ing memory load. In addition, there was more 

face-related activity in the visual cortex in 

the high load condition than the low load 

condition.
In sum, the effects of distracting stimuli 
depend on perceptual load and on the load 

on executive control. High perceptual load 

decreases
 the impact of distracting stimuli on 

task performance, whereas high executive con-

trol load 
increases
 the impact of distracting 

stimuli. Thus, there is no simple relationship 

between load and susceptibility to distraction 

Œit all depends on the nature of the load.

cesses by studying brain-damaged individuals

is of central importance to neglect. Most of the 
evidence indi cates that Corbetta and Shulman™s 

(2002) stimulus-driven system is damaged in 

neglect patients.
Extinction
 is often found in patients 
suffering from neglect. Extinction
 
involves the 
inability to detect a visual stimulus on the side 

opposite that of the brain damage in the presence 

of a second visual stimulus on the same side as 

the brain damage. Extinction is a serious condition,  

because multiple stimuli are typically present 

at the same time in everyday life.
How can we explain neglect? Driver and 
Vuilleumier (2001, p. 40) argued that what 

happens in neglect patients is a more extreme 

form of what happens in healthy individuals. 

According to them, ﬁPerceptual awareness is 

not determined solely by the stimuli imping-

ing on our senses, but also by which of these 

stimuli we choose to attend. This choice seems 

pathologically limited in neglect patients, with 

their attention strongly biased towards events 
Some neglect patients show personal neglect 
(e.g., failing to shave the left side of their face), 

whereas others show neglect for far space but 

not for near space. Buxbaum et al. (2004) 

found 12 different patterns of de˚
 cit. Thus, 
neglect is 
not
 a single disorder.
We can test for the presence of neglect in 
various ways (e.g., tasks in which patients copy 

˚
 gures). Neglect patients typically distort or 
neglect the left side of any ˚
 gure they copy (see 
Figure 5.11). Then there is the line bisection

Which brain areas are damaged in neglect 
patients? There is controversy on this issue. Some 

˚
 ndings suggest that the superior temporal gyrus 
is crucial, whereas others point to the temporo-

parietal junction or the angular gyrus (Danckert 

& Ferber, 2006; see Figure 5.12). Fierro et al. 

(2000) found that they could produce neglect-

like performance on the line bisection task by 

administering transcranial magnetic stimulation 

(TMS; see Glossary) to the angular gyrus, which 

strengthens the argument that damage to this 

area is involved in neglect. Bartolomeo, Thiebaut 

de Schotten, and Doricchi (2007) reviewed the 

literature and concluded that neglect is due to 

the disconnection of large-scale brain networks 

rather than damage to a single cortical region.

Neglect patients "

neglected side of the visual ˚ eld fairly thor-

oughly even though they lack conscious aware-

ness of those stimuli (e.g., the study by 

McGlinchey-Berroth et al., 1993, discussed 

earlier). Marshall and Halligan (1988) pre-

sented a neglect patient with two drawings of 

a house identical except that the house pre-

sented to the left visual ˚ eld had ˜
 ames coming 
out of its windows. The patient could not 

report any differences between the two draw-

ings but indicated she would prefer to live in 

the house on the right.
Vuilleumier, Armony, Clarke, Husain, Driver, 
and Dolan (2002) presented pictures of objects 

brie˜
 y to the left visual ˚ eld, the right visual 
˚
 eld, or to both visual ˚ elds to patients with 
neglect and extinction. When two pictures were 

presented together, patients 
only reported the 

picture presented to the right visual ˚
 eld. They 
also showed very little memory for the pictures 

presented to the left visual ˚
 eld. 
Finally, the 
patients identi˚
 ed degraded pictures.
 There was 
a facilitation effect for pictures that had been 

presented to the neglected visual ˚
 eld,indicat-
ing that they had been processed.
Further evidence that extinguished stimuli 
are processed was reported by Rees et al. 

(2000) in an fMRI study. Extinguished stimuli 

produced moderate levels of activation in the 

primary visual cortex and some nearby areas. 

This suggested that these stimuli of which the 

patient was unaware were nonetheless processed 

reasonably thoroughly.
Evidence that competition is important i n 
extinction was reported by Marzi 
et al. 
(1997). 
Extinction patients detected contra lesional stimuli 

(presented to the side opposite 
the brain damage) 
more slowly than ipsilesional 
ones (presented to  
the same side as the brain damage) when only one 

stimulus was presented at a time. Those patients

According to Marzi et al., extinc-
tion 
occurs in part because the contralesional 
stimuli cannot 
compete
 successfully 
for attention; 
on the ipsilesional side [same side as the lesion].ﬂ 

Thus, there are important similarities between 

neglect in patients and inattention in healthy 

individuals.
How can we explain extinction? Marzi 
et al. (2001, p. 1354) offered the following 

explanation:
The presence of extinction only during 

bilateral stimulation is strongly suggestive 

of a competition mechanism, whereby 

the presence of a more salient stimulus 

presented on the same side of space as 

that of the brain lesion (ipsilesional side) 

captures attention and hampers the 

perception of a less salient stimulus on 

the opposite (contralesional) side.
Driver and Vuilleumier (2001, p. 50) provided 

a similar account: ﬁWhile extinction is by no 

means the whole story for neglect, it encapsu-

lates a critical general principle that applies 

for most aspects of neglect, namely, that the 
patient™
s spatial de˚ cit is most apparent in com-
petitive situations.ﬂ
As we saw earlier, Corbetta and Shulman 
(2002) argued that the attentional problems of 

neglect patients are due mainly to impairment 

of the stimulus-driven system. Bartolomeo 

and Chokron (2002, p. 217) proposed a similar  

hypothesis: ﬁA basic mechanism leading to left 

neglect behaviour is an impaired exogenous 

[originating outside the individual] orienting 

towards left-sided targets. In contrast, endogen-

ous processes [originating inside the individual] 

seem to be relatively preserved, if slowed, in left  

unilateral neglect.ﬂ In simpler terms, bottom-up  

processes are more impaired than top-down 

ones in neglect patients.
There is reasonable overlap among the vari-
ous theoretical accounts. For example, impaired 

functioning of a competition mechanism in 

patients with neglect and extinction ma"
Segment_301,"y be   due in large measure to damage to the stimulus-  driven system. However, what is distinctive   about Bartolomeo and Chokron™s (2002) theory   is the notion that the goal-directed system is   reasonably intact in neglect patients. 9781841695402_4_005.indd   172 9781841695402_4_005.indd   172 1",Explores how perception influences cognition.,"memory, attention, recognition",Nested under Chapter on recognition,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in perception,Aligned with contemporary studies on attention,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_284,"y be

the cue was presented to the right side and the 
target to the left side.
Duncan, Bundesen, Olson, Humphreys, 
Chavda, Shibuya (1999) presented arrays of 

letters brie˜
 y, and asked neglect patients to 
the slower the processing of contralesional stimuli  

compared to ipsilesional stimuli, the less their 

ability to 
compete for attention.
Under what circumstances is extinction 
reduced or eliminated? Theoretically, we could 

reduce competition by presenting two stimuli 

integrated in some way. For example, an extinc-

tion patient showed extinction when black circles 

with quarter-segments removed were presented 

to the contralesional side at the same time as 

similar stimuli were presented to the ipsilateral 

side (Mattingley, Davis, & Driver, 1997). However, 

extinction was much reduced when the stimuli 

were altered slightly to form Kanizsa™s illusory 

square (see Figure 2.20). Rather similar ˚
 nding 
were found with neglect patients by Conci, 

Matthias, Keller, Muller, and Finke (2009).
Riddoch, Humphreys, Hickman, Daly, and 
Colin (2006) extended the above research. Two 

stimuli were presented brie˜
 y either side of the 
˚
 xation point. They repres ented objects often 
used together, less often used together, and never 

used together (control condition) (see Figure 5.13). 

Extinction patients identi˚ ed both items most 

frequently when 
both objects are often used 

together (65% 
correct), followed by objects less 
often used together (55%), 
and control items 
(40%). Thus,

extinction when two stimuli can be combined

Dijkerman, and Milner (2008) found 
that prism 
adaptation in neglect patients 
improved their 
ability to orient attention leftwards following 

an endogenous (internal) cue but not following 

an exogenous (external) one. 
They concluded 

that prism adaptation made it 
easier for neglect 
patients to engage in voluntary orienting to 

compensate for their habitual rightward bias.
Evaluation
The study of neglect and extinction patients 

has produced several important ˚
 ndings. First, 
such patients can process unattended visual 

stimuli, and this processing is sometimes at 

the semantic level (McGlinchey-Berroth et al., 

1993). Second, such patients provide evidence 

a"
Segment_303,"bout the range of preattentive processing,   which can include grouping of visual stimuli   (e.g., Mattingley et al., 1997; Riddoch et al.,   2006). Third, neglect patients have several   impairments of exogenous orienting (stimulus-  driven processing) but much milder impairments   of endogenous or",Explores how awareness influences cognition.,"perception, awareness, attention",Nested under Chapter on recognition,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in awareness,Aligned with contemporary studies on awareness,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_154,"bout the range of preattentive processing, 

which can include grouping of visual stimuli 

(e.g., Mattingley et al., 1997; Riddoch et al., 

2006). Third, neglect patients have several 

impairments of exogenous orienting (stimulus-

driven processing) but much milder impairments 

of endogenous orienting (top-down processing).  

Fourth, the success of prism adaptation as a 

form of treatment for neglect is likely to lead to  

an enhanced understanding of the underlying 

mechanisms of neglect.
What are the limitations of research 
o n  neglect and extinction? First, the precise 

symptoms and regions of brain damage vary 

considerably across patients. Thus, it is dif˚
 cult 
to produce a theoretical account applicable to 

all patients with neglect or extinction. Second, 

it has generally been assumed that patients™ 

problems centre on the contralesional side 

of the visual ˚ eld. The ˚ ndings of Snow and 

Mattingley (2006) suggest that patients may also 

have unexpected problems with atten
tional 

control on the ipsilesional side of 
the visual 
˚
 eld. Third, while it is clear that 
attentional 
processes are important to an 
understanding 
of neglect and extinction, the 
precise nature 

of those processes has not 
been established.
Three attentional abilities
Posner and Petersen (1990) proposed a theor-

etical framework representing a development 
recall all the letters or to recall only those in a 

pre-speci˚
 ed colour. It was assumed that end-
ogenous orienting was possible 
only
 in the latter 
condition. As expected, recall of letters presented 

to the left side was much worse than that of 

letters presented to the right side when all letters 

had to be reported. However, neglect patients 

resembled healthy controls in showing equal 

recall of letters presented to each side of visual 

space when target letters were de˚ ned by colour.
It has generally been assumed that atten-

not
 the case was reported 

by Snow and Mattingley (2006). Patients with 

right-hemisphere lesions (presumably a mixture 

of neglect and extinction patients) made speeded 

judgements about a central target item. To-be-

ignored stimuli presented to the
 right
 field 

interfered with task performance for the patients 

regardless of their relevance to the task. These 

stimuli only interfered with task performance 

for healthy controls when relevant to the task. 

The take-home message is that patients have 

de˚
 cient top-down or goal-driven attentional 
control even for stimuli presented to the ﬁgoodﬂ 

or ipsilesional side, and thus their attentional 

problems are greater than is generally assumed.
How can we reduce the symptoms of 
neglect? 
Rossetti, Rode, Pisella, Boisson, and Perenin 

(1998) came up with an interesting answer. When 

neglect patients in the dark are asked to point 

straight ahead, they typically point several 

degrees off to the right. This led Rossetti et al. to  

ask neglect patients to wear prisms that shifted 

the visual ˚ eld 10 degrees to the right. After 

adaptation, patients in the dark pointed almost 

directly ahead. They also performed signi˚
 cantly 
better on other tasks (e.g., the line-bisection task) 

and 
produced more symmetrical drawings of 
a  daisy for up to two hours after prism removal.  

Subsequent research (reviewed by Chokron, 

Dupierrix, Tabert, & Bartolomeo, 2007) has 

con˚
 rmed the effectiveness of prism adaptation  
up to ˚ ve weeks after prism removal.

Problems with disengaging attention are 
found in patients suffering from

. In this condition, only one object (out 

of two or three) can be seen at any one time 

even when the objects are close together. Michel 

and Henaff (2004) found that AT, a patient 

with simultanagnosia, had an almost normal 

visual ˚ eld but a substantially restricted atten-

tional visual ˚eld. The presence of a restricted 

attentional ˚ eld probably explains why patients 

with simultanagnosia have ﬁstickyﬂ ˚
 xations 
and ˚ nd it hard to disengage attention.
Tyler (1968) described a patient whose visual 
exploration was limited to ﬁthe point in the 

picture where her eye accidentally was, when 

the picture was projected.ﬂ Nyffeler et al. (2005) 

studied a 53-year-old woman with simultanag-

nosia. She was asked to name four overlapping 

objects presented horizontally so that two were 

presented to the left and two to the right of the 

initial ˚ xation point. She had great dif˚
 culty 
in disengaging attention from the objects pre-

sented to the left side: 73% of her eye ˚
 xations 
were on one of those objects. As a result, she 

totally failed to ˚ xate almost one-quarter of 

the objects. In contrast, healthy participants 

˚
 xated virtually 100% of the objects.
Shifting of attention
Posner, Rafal, Choate, and Vaughan (1985) 

examined problems of shifting attention in 

patients with progressive supranuclear palsy. 

Such patients have damage to the midbrain 

and ˚ nd it very hard to make voluntary eye 

movements, especially in the vertical direction. 

Posner et al. presented cues 
to the locations of 

forthcoming targets followed at va
rying intervals 
of his earlier notion of separate endogenous a n d 

exogenous systems (Posner, 1980; see 
earlier 
in chapter). According to Posner and Petersen, 

three separate abilities are involved in control-

These three abilities are all functions of the 

posterior attention system (resembling the 

stimulus-driven system of Corbetta and Shulman, 
2002). In addition, there is an anterior atten-

tion system (resembling Corbetta and Shulman™
s 
goal-directed system). It is involved in co-

ordinating the different aspects of visual attention, 

and resembles the central executive 
component  
of working memory (see Chapter 6). 
According  
to Posner and Petersen (1990, 
p. 40), 
there is 
ﬁa hierarchy of attentional systems in which 

the anterior system can pass control to the 

posterior system when it is not occupied with  

processing other material.ﬂ In what follows, 

we will brie˜
 y consider the three attentional 
abilities identi˚
 ed by Posner and Petersen 
(1990) in the light of evidence from brain-

damaged patients.
Disengagement of attention
According to Posner and Petersen (1990), 

damage to the posterior parietal region is most 

associated with impaired disengagement of 

attention. As we have seen, neglect patients 

have suffered damage to the parietal region of 

the brain. Losier and Klein (2001) found, in a 

meta-analysis, that problems of disengagement 

of attention were greater in patients suffering 

from neglect than in other brain-damaged 

patients. However, there is evidence that neglect 

patients only have problems of disengagement 

when they need to shift attention
 between
 
rather than
 within
 objects (Schindler et al., 

2009). This suggests that it is hard to disengage 

from objects but not necessarily from a given 
simultanagnosia:
 a brain-damaged condition in 
which only one object can be seen at a time.

However, she often mistakenly assigned the 

colour of the distractor letter to it, especially 

when the two letters were close together. This 

suggests a dif˚ culty in effective attentional 

engagement with the target letter.
Additional evidence that the pulvinar nucleus  
of the thalamus is involved in controlling focused 

attention was obtained by LaBerge and Buchsbaum 

(1990). PET scans indicated increased activa-

tion in the pulvinar nucleus when participants 

ignored a given stimulus. Thus, the pulvinar 

nucleus is involved in preventing attention from 

being focused on an unwanted stimulus as well 

as in directing attention to signi˚
 cant stimuli.
Evaluation
Several fairly speci˚ c attentional problems have 

been found in brain-damaged patients. Thus, 

it makes sense to assume that the attentional 

system consists of various components. In general 

terms, we can distinguish among disengaging 

of attention from a stimulus, shifting of atten-

tion, and engaging of attention on a new stimulus. 

Posner and Petersen (1990) went a step further 

and tentatively identi˚
 ed brain areas especially 
associated with each process.
The main limitation of theorising in this 
area is that it oversimpli˚ es a complex reality. 

For example, it has been argued that the pulvinar 

is involved in orienting to feature changes 

(Michael & Buron, 2005) as well as attentional 

engagement. Evidence that different parts of 

the pulvinar are involved in somewhat different 

processes was reported by Arend, Rafal, and 

Ward (2008). A patient with damage to the 

anterior of the pulvinar found it harder to 

engage spatial than temporal attention, whereas 

another patient with posterior pulvinar damage 

showed the opposite pattern.

cues (cues providing accurate information about 

target location) when the targets were presented 

to the left or right of the cue. However, they had 

dif˚
 culty in shifting their attention appropriately 
in the vertical direction in response to the cues.
Part of the midbrain known as the superior 
colliculus is involved in the top-down control 

of attention and is important in attentional 

shifting. For example, Bell and Munoz (2008) 

studied a monkey™s ability to use a cue to shift 

attention to the valid location. There was a 

greater increase in activity within the superior 

colliculus when the monkey shifted attention 

appropriately than when it did not.
Further evidence of the role of the superior 
colliculus in the shifting of attention was reported 

by Sereno, Briand, Amador, and Szapiel (2006). 

A patient with damage to the superior colliculus 

showed a complete absence of inhibition of 

return (discussed earlier; see Glossary). Since 

the great majority of healthy individuals show 

inhibition of return, it seems damage to the 

superior colliculus disrupts processes associated 

with shifting of attention.
Engaging attention
According to Posner and Petersen (1990), the 

pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus plays an 

important role in engaging attention to an 

appropriate stimulus and suppressing attention 

to irrelevant stimuli. Rafal and Posner (1987) 

carried out a study in which patients with 

pulvinar damage responded to visual targets 

preceded by cues. They responded faster after 

valid than invalid cues when the target stimulus 

was presented to the same side as the brain 

damage. However, they responded rather slowly 

following both kinds of cues when the target 

stimulus was presented to the side opposite to 

the brain damage. These ˚ ndings suggest the

for a target in a visual display having a set or 
display size of between one and 30 items. The 

target was either an object based on a conjunc-

tion of features (a green letter T) or consisted 

of a single feature (a blue letter or an S). When 

the target was a green letter T, all non-targets 

shared one feature with the target (i.e., they were  

either the brown letter T or the green letter X). 

The prediction was that focused attention 

would be needed to detect the conjunctive target 

(because it was de˚ ned by a combination or 

conjunction of features), but would not be 

required to detect single-feature targets.
The findings were as predicted (see Fig-
ure 5.14). Set or display size had a large effect 

on detection speed when the target was de˚
 ned 
by a combination or conjunction of features 

(i.e., a green letter T), presumably because 

focused attention was required. However, there 

was very little effect of display size when the 

target was de˚ned by a single feature (i.e., a 

blue letter or an S).
Feature integration theory assumes that lack 
of focused attention can produce illusory con-

junctions (random combinations of features). 

Friedman-Hill, Robertson, and Treisman (1995) 

studied a brain-damaged patient who had 

problems with the accurate location of visual 

stimuli. He produced many illusory conjunc-

tions, combining the shape of one stimulus 

with the colour of another.
According to feature integration theory, 
illusory conjunctions occur because of problems 

in combining features to form objects at a 

relatively late stage of processing. Evidence

processes involved in such activities have been 

examined in studies on 
visual search
, in which a  

speci˚
 ed target within a visual display must be  
detected as rapidly as possible. On visual search 

tasks, participants are typically presented with 

a visual display containing a variable number of  

items (the set or 
display size). A target (e.g., red G)  
is presented on 
half the trials, and participants  
decide rapidly 
whether the target is present.
Feature integration theory
Treisman (e.g., 1988, 1992) and Treisman and 

Gelade (1980) put forward feature integration 

theory, a very in˜ uential approach to under-

standing visual search. Here are its main 

assumptions:
There is an important distinction between
†
the features of objects (e.g. colour, size, lines

in particular orientation) and the objects

themselves.

There is a rapid parallel process in which
†
the visual features of objects in the environ-

ment are processed together; this does not

depend on attention.

There is then a serial process in which
†
features are combined to form objects.

The serial process is slower than the initial
†
parallel process, especially when the set size

is large.

Features can be combined by focused atten-
†
tion to the location of the object, in which

case focused attention provides the ﬁglueﬂ

forming unitary objects from the available

features.

Feature combination can be in˜
 uenced by
†
stored knowledge (e.g., bananas are usually

yellow).

In the absence of focused attention or
†
relevant stored knowledge, features from

different objects will be combined randomly,"

on visual search times when the target was 
very similar to the distractors even when the 

target was identi˚

and Sato (1990) conceded that this factor was 

important. They found that visual search for 

an object target de˚ ned by more than one 

feature was typically limited to those distrac-

tors sharing at least one of the target™s features. 

For example, if you were looking for a blue 

circle in a display containing blue triangles, 

red circles, and red triangles, you would ignore 

red triangles.

late rather than relatively early, suggesting that 

the processes involved in combining features

Treisman (1993) put forward a more com-
plex version of feature integration theory in 

which there are four kinds of attentional selec-

tion. First, there is selection by 
location
 involving  

a relatively broad or narrow attention window. 

Second, there is selection by 
features
. Features 

are divided into surface-de˚ ning features (e.g., 

colour; brightness; relative motion) and shape-

de˚
 ning features (e.g., orientation; size). Third, 
there is selection on the basis of 
object-deÞ ned 

locations
. Fourth, there is selection at a late 

stage of processing that determines the

attentional selectivity can operate at various

from the early stages of sensory encoding 
to higher order characteristics of attentional 

control. . . . FIT was one of the most in˜
 uential 
and important theories of visual information.ﬂ
Feature integration theory (especially the 
original version) possesses several limitations. 

First, as we will see, conjunction searches do 
not
 
typically involve parallel processing followed 

by serial search. Second, the search for targets 

consisting of a conjunction or combination of 

features is typically faster than predicted by 

the theory. Factors causing fast detection that 

are missing from the theory (e.g., grouping of 

distractors; distractors sharing no features with 

targets) are incorporated into guided search 

theory. Third, and related to the second point, 

it was originally assumed that effects of set size 

on visual search depend mainly on the nature of  

the target (single feature or conjunctive feature). 

In fact, the nature of the distractors (e.g., their 

similarity to e"
Segment_313,"ach other) is also important.

Fourth, the theory seems to predict that the 

attentional de˚ cits of neglect and extinction 

patients should disrupt their search for con-

junctive but not single-feature targets. In fact, 

such patients often detect both types of target 

more slowly than healthy individuals even 

though the impairment is greater with conjunctive 

targets (Umiltà, 2001).
Decision integration hypothesis
According to feature integration theory, pro-

cessing in visual search varies considerably 

depending on whether the targets are de˚
 ned 
by single features or by conjunctions of features. 

In contrast, Palmer and his associates (e.g., 

Eckstein, Thomas, Palmer, & Shimozaki, 2000; 

Palmer, Verghese, & Pavel, 2000) argued, in their 

decision integration hypothesis, that parallel 

processing is involved in both kinds of search.
Palmer et al. (2000) argued that observers 
form internal representations of target and 

distractor stimuli. These representations are 

noisy because the internal response to any given 

item varies from trial to trial. Visual search 

involves decision making based on the 
discrim-
inability
 between target and distractor items 
Guided search theory
Wolfe (1998, 2003) developed feature integra-

tion theory in his guided search theory. He 

replaced Treisman™s assumption that the initial 

feature processing is necessarily parallel and 

subsequent processing is serial with the notion 

that processes are more or less ef˚
 cient. Why 
did he do this? According to Wolfe (p. 20), 

ﬁResults of visual search experiments run

 set size 

functions. . . . The continuum [continuous distri-

bution] of search slopes does make it implausible 

to think that the search tasks, themselves, can 

be neatly classi˚ ed as serial or parallel.ﬂ More

 ndings typically 
fall between these two extremes.
Guided search theory is based on the assump-
tionthat the initial processing of basic features 

produces an activation map, with every item 

in the visual display having its own level of 

activation. Suppose someone is searching 

for red, horizontal targets. Feature processing 

would activate all red objects and all horizontal 

objects. Attention is then directed towards items 

on the basis of their level of activation, starting 

with those most activated. This assumption 

explains why search times are longer when some 

distractors share one or more features with 

targets (e.g., Duncan & Humphreys, 1989).
A central problem with the original version 
of feature integration theory is that targets in 

large displays are typically detected faster than 

predicted. The activation-map notion provides 

a plausible way in which visual search can be 

made more ef˚ cient by ignoring stimuli not 

sharing any features with the target.
Evaluation
Feature integration theory has been very in˜
 u-
ential because it was the ˚ rst systematic attempt 

to understand the processes determining speed 

of visual search. However, its in˜
 uence extends 
well beyond that. As Quinlan (2003, p. 643)

 ndings suggested 
that parallel processing was used for feature 

and conjunction searches.
Leonards, Sunaert, Van Hecke, and Orban 
(2000) carried out an fMRI study to assess the 

brain areas involved in feature and conjunction 

search. They concluded that, ﬁThe cerebral

 cient (feature) and inef˚
 cient 
regardless of whether the targets are de˚
 ned by 
single features or by conjunctions of features. 

Why is visual search less ef˚ cient with conjunc-

tion searches than feature searches? Conjunction 

searches are harder because there is less dis-

criminability between target and distractor 

stimuli. Visual search is typically slower with 

larger set sizes because the complexity of the 

decision-making process is greater when there 

are numerous items in the visual display.
McElree and Carrasco (1999) reported 
˚
 ndings consistent with the decision integration 
hypothesis. They pointed out that the usual 

practice of assessing visual search performance 

only by reaction time is limited, because speed 

of performance depends in part on participants™ 

willingness (or otherwise) to accept errors. 

Accordingly, they controlled speed of perform-

ance by requiring participants to respond 

rapidly following a signal. Each visual display 

contained 4, 10, or 16 items, and targets were 

de˚
 ned by a single feature or by a conjunction 
of features.

found with search tasks in which targets and 
distractors only differed along a single feature 

dimension (e.g., colour; size; orientation). This 

makes sense given that parallel processes in early 

visual cortex seem to detect such features very 

rapidly (Kandel, Schwartz, & Jessell, 2005).
Another data pattern strongly suggested 
serial processing. It consisted of target-detection 

times increasing rapidly with increasing set size 

on single-target trials and also increasing with 

increasing set size when all the stimuli were 

targets. This pattern was found with complex 

visual tasks involving the detection of a speci˚
 c 
direction of rotation (e.g., pinwheels rotating 

clockwise; textures rotating clockwise).
Finally, there was an intermediate pattern 
consisting 
of moderate increases of set size on 
target
-detection times with single targets and 

no effect of set size when all the stimuli were 

targets. Conjunction search tasks in which tar-

gets were de˚ ned by a conjunction of features 

(e.g., white verticals) exhibited this pattern. 

On balance, this pattern of ˚ ndings was more 

consistent with parallel models than serial ones.
What conclusions can we draw from the 
above research? First, Thornton and Gilden 

(2007) have provided perhaps the strongest 

evidence yet that some visual search tasks 

involve parallel search whereas others involve 

serial search. Second, they found that 72% of

processing models account for more of the data 

than do serial processing models. Third, the

longest average target-detection times.
Overall evaluation
There has been much progress in understanding 

the processes involved in visual search. Even 

though it has proved dif˚ cult to decide whether 

serial, parallel, or a mixture of serial and parallel 

processes are used on any given task, several 

factors in˜ uencing the search process have been 

identi˚
 ed. Developments such as the use of 
multiple targets have clari˚ ed the situation. It 
(conjunction) search overlap almost completely.ﬂ  

These ˚ ndings suggest that feature and con-

junction searches involve very similar processes, 

as assumed by the decision integration hypo-

thesis. Anderson et al. (2007) reported that there 

was some overlap in the brain regions activated 

during the two kinds of search, especially 

within the superior frontal cortex. However, 

there was more activation of the inferior and 

middle frontal cortex with conjunction search 

than with feature search, probably because the 

former type of search placed more demands 

on attentional processes.
Multiple-target visual search
Nearly all the research on visual search discussed 

so far has involved a 
single
 target presented 

among distractors. It has generally been assumed 

that progressive lengthening of target-detection 

time with increasing number of distractors 

indicates serial processing. However, as Townsend 

(e.g., 1990) pointed out, the same pattern of 

˚
 ndings could result from a parallel process 
incurring costs of divided attention. Thornton 

and Gilden (2007) argued that we can clarify 

the crucial issue of whether visual search is serial 

or parallel by using multiple targets. Consider 

what happens when all the stimuli in a vis"
Segment_318,"ual   display are targets. If processing is serial, the   ˚  rst item analysed will  always  be a target and  so target-detection time should not vary as a   function of set size. In contrast, suppose that   target-detection time  decreases  as the number   of targets increases. That would indicate",Explores how awareness influences cognition.,"awareness, recognition, attention",Nested under Chapter on memory,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in perception,Aligned with contemporary studies on awareness,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_908,"ual 

display are targets. If processing is serial, the 

˚
 rst item analysed will 
always
 be a target and 
so target-detection time should not vary as a 

function of set size. In contrast, suppose that 

target-detection time 
decreases
 as the number 

of targets increases. That would indicate parallel 

processing, because such processing would allow 

individuals to take in information from all the 

targets at the same time.
Thornton and Gilden used a combination 
of single-target and multiple-target trials with 

29 visual search tasks in which the set size was 

1, 2, or 4. Across these tasks, there were three 

basic patterns in the data. One pattern strongly 

suggested parallel processing. It consisted of 

target-detection times increasing only modestly  

with increasing set size on single-target trials 

and decreasing with increasing set size when 

all the stimuli were targets. This pattern was

on the grounds that attentional processes in 
each sensory modality (e.g., vision; hearing) 

operate 
independently
 from those in all other 
modalities. In fact, that assumption is wrong. 

In the real world, we often combine or inte-

grate information from different sense modalities 

at the same time (
cross-modal attention
). For 

example, when listening to someone speaking, 

we often observe their lip movements at the 

same time. Information from the auditory 

and visual modalities is combined to facilitate 

our understanding of what they are saying 

(lip-reading Œ see Chapter 9).
Before turning to research on cross-modal 
effects, we need to distinguish between endogen-

ous spatial attention and exogenous spatial 

attention (see the earlier discussion of Posner™s 

endogenous and exogenous attention systems). 

Endogenous
 
spatial attention 
involves an indi-
vidual voluntarily directing"
Segment_319,"his / her visual atten-  tion to a given spatial location. This generally   happens because he / she anticipates that a target   stimulus will be presented at that location.

tion to a given spatial location. This generally 

happens because he / she anticipates that a target 

stimulus will be presented at that location. In 

contrast, 
exogenous spatial attention
 involves 
the ﬁinvoluntaryﬂ direction of visual attention 

to a given spatial location determined by aspects 

of the stimulus there (e.g., its intensity or its threat 

value). Cross-modal effects occur when 
directing 

visual attention to a given location also 
attracts 

auditory and / or tactile (touch-based) attention 

to the same location. Alternatively, directing 

auditory tactile attention to a given 
location 

can attract visual attention to the same place.
appears that parallel processing is used on most 

visual search tasks other than those that are 

very complicated and so have especially long 

times to detect targets.
What are the limitations of research in this 
area? First, much of it is of dubious relevance 

to our everyday lives. As Wolfe (1998, p. 56) 

pointed out, ﬁIn the real world, distractors are 

very heterogeneous [diverse]. Stimuli exist in 

many size scales in a single view. Items are 

probably de˚ ned by conjunctions of many 

features. You don™t get several hundred trials 

with the same targets and distractors.ﬂ
Second, in most research, a target is pre-
sented on 50% of trials. In contrast, targets 

are very rare in several very important situations 

such as airport security checks. Does this matter? 

Evidence that it does was reported by Wolfe, 

Horowitz, Van Wert, Kenner, Place, and Kibbi 

(2007). Participants were shown X-ray images 

of packed bags and the targets were 
weapons  

(knives or guns). When targets appeared o n  5 0 % 

of trials, 80% of them were detected. When 

targets appeared on 2% of the trials, the detection 

rate fell to only 54%. This poor performance 

was due to excessive caution in reporting a target 

rather than a lack of attention.
Third, most researchers have used react"
Segment_320,"ion- time measures of visual search performance.   This is unfortunate because there are many   ways of interpreting such data. As McElree   and Carrasco (1999, p. 1532) pointed out, ﬁ RT   [reaction time] data are of limitedvalue . . .   because RT can vary with either  differences  in discriminabi",Explores how attention influences cognition.,"emotion, perception, recognition",Nested under Chapter on attention,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in awareness,Aligned with contemporary studies on memory,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_1090,"ion-
time measures of visual search performance. 

This is unfortunate because there are many 

ways of interpreting such data. As McElree 

and Carrasco (1999, p. 1532) pointed out, ﬁ RT 

[reaction time] data are of limitedvalue . . . 

because RT can vary with either 
differences 
in discriminability, differences in processing 

speed, or unknown mixtures of the two effects.ﬂ 

In that connection, the speedŒaccuracy trade-

off procedure used by McElree and Carrasco 

is a de˚
 nite improvement.
CROSS-MODAL EFFECTS
The great majority of the research discussed 

so far is limited in that the visual modality was 

studied on its own. In similar fashion, research 

on auditory attention typically ignores visual 

perception. This approach has been justi˚
 ed 
cross-modal attention:
 the co-ordination 
of attention across two or more modalities 

(e.g., vision and audition).

endogenous spatial attention:
 attention to 

a given spatial location determined by voluntary 

or goal-directed mechanisms; see 
exogenous 

spatial attention

exogenous spatial attention:
 attention to a 

given spatial location determined by ﬁinvoluntaryﬂ 

mechanisms triggered by external stimuli

to show that the ventriloquist illusion involves 
processing within the auditory cortex matching 

the apparent visual source of the sound. 
Why
 

does vision dominate sound? The location of 

environmental events is typically indicated 

more precisely by visual than auditory informa-

tion, and so it makes sense for us to rely more 

heavily on vision.
We turn now to endogenous or ﬁvoluntaryﬂ 
spatial attention. Suppose we present particip-

ants with two streams of light (as was done 

by Eimer and Schröger, 1998), with one stream 

of light being presented to the left and the other

participants with two streams of sound, with 

one stream of sound being presented to each side. 

In one condition, participants are instructed to 

detect deviant 
visual
 events (e.g., longer than 

usual stimuli) presented to one side only. In the 

other condition, participants have to detect 
deviant 

auditory
 events in only one of the 
streams.
Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded 
to obtain information about the allocation of 

attention. Not surprisingly, Eimer and Schröger 

(1998) found that ERPs to deviant stimuli in 

the 
relevant
 modality were greater to stimuli 
presented on the to-be-attended side than those 

on the to-be-ignored side. This ˚
 nding simply 
shows that participants allocated their atten-

tion as instructed. What is of more interest is 

what happened to the allocation of attention 

in the 
irrelevant
 modality. Suppose participants  

had to detect 
visual
 targets on the left side. 

In that case, ERPs to deviant 
auditory
 stimuli 

were greater on the left side than on the right 

side. This is a cross-modal effect in which the 

voluntary or endogenous allocation of visual 

attention also affected the allocation of auditory 

attention. In similar fashion, when participants

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
We have seen that voluntary and involuntary 
visual attention can in˜ uence auditory attention, 
and vice versa. In addition, visual attention to 

a given location can in˜ uence attention to tactile 

stimuli (involving touch) and attention to tactile 

stimuli at a given location can in˜
 uence visual 
attention (Driver & Spence, 1998).
What light has cognitive neuroscience shed 
on cross-modal effects? The effects depend in part  

on multi-modal neurons, which are responsive 

to stimuli in various modalities. These neurons 

respond strongly to multi-modal stimulation 

at a given location. However, they show reduced 

responding when there is multi-modal stimula-

tion involving more than one location (see Stein 

& Meredith, 1993, for a review).
Molholm, Martinez, Shpanker, and Foxe 
(2007) carried out a study using event-related 

potentials (ERPs; see Glossary) in which part i -

cipants attended to the visual or auditory 

features of an object. There was brain activation 

of object features in the task-irrelevant sensory 

modality, especially when the task required

visual or auditory input are often found in close 

proximity in several areas of the brain, including 

the midbrain and the cerebral cortex. What 

Driver and Noesselt describe as ﬁmulti-sensory 

interplayﬂ also happens in and around auditory 

cortex. Such interplay is much more prevalent 

than was assumed by traditional approaches 

that regarded each sensory system as being 

independent of the others.
Evaluation
Studies of exogenous spatial attention, endo-

genous spatial attention, and the ventriloquist 

illusion indicate clearly that there are numerous 

links between the sense modalities. The same 

conclusion emerges from neuroscience research, 

and that research has increased our under-

standing of some of the brain mechanisms 

involved. Of most importance, these ˚
 ndings 
demonstrate the falsity of the traditional 

assumption (generally implicit) that attentional 
side were greater than ERPs to those on the 

opposite side. Thus, the allocation of auditory 

attention in˜ uenced the allocation of visual 

attention as well.
Eimer, van Velzen, Forster, and Driver (2003)  
pointed out that nearly all cross-modal studies 

on endogenous spatial attention had used 

situations in which the locations of auditory 

and tactile targets were visible. As a result, 

it is possible the cross-modal effects obtained 

depended heavily on the visual modality. 

However, Eimer et al. found that visualŒtactile 

cross-modal effects were very similar in lit and 

dark environments. The ˚ ndings can be inter-

preted by assuming that endogenous spatial 

attention is controlled for the most part by a 

high-level system that in˜
 uences attentional 
processes within each sensory modality.
We now turn to exogenous or ﬁinvoluntaryﬂ  
spatial attention. Clear evidence of cross-modal 

effects was reported by Spence and Driver 

(1996). Participants ˚ xated straight ahead with  

hands uncrossed, holding a sma"

There was a   sound from one o f   the loudspeakers shortly",Explores how attention influences cognition.,"perception, awareness, memory",Nested under Chapter on perception,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in attention,Aligned with contemporary studies on attention,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_866,"ll cube in each

with one light at the top and one at the bottom 

of each diode. In one condition, loudspeakers 

were placed directly above and below each 

hand close to 
the light sources. There was a  
sound from one o f  
the loudspeakers shortly 
before one of the four lights was illuminated. 

Visual judgements were more accurate when 

the auditory cue was on the 
same
 side as the 

subsequent visual target even though the 

cue did 
not
 predict which light would be 

illuminated. Thus, ﬁinvoluntaryﬂ or exogenous 

auditory attention in˜
 uenced the allocation of 
visual attention.
Spence and Driver (1996) also had a condi-
tion in which the roles of the visual and auditory 

modalities were reversed. In other words, a 

light was illuminated shortly before a sound 

was presented, and the task involved making 

auditory judgements. Auditory judgements 

were more accurate when the non-predictive 

visual cue was on the 
same
 side as the sub-

sequent auditory target. Thus, involuntary visual 

attention in˜
 uenced the allocation of auditory 
attention.

When we consider multi-tasking in every-
day life, an issue of great importance is whether 
the ability to drive a car is impaired when the 

driver uses a mobile phone. More than 20 

countries have passed laws restricting the use 

of mobile phones by drivers, which suggests it 

is a dangerous practice. The relevant research 

evidence is discussed in the box.
Factors determining dual-task 
performance
What determines how well we can perform 
two activities at the same time? Three impor-

tant factors will be discussed in this section: 

task similarity, practice, and task dif˚
 culty. 
With respect to task similarity, two tasks can 

be similar in stimulus modality or the required 

responses. Treisman and Davies ("
Segment_325,1973) found   that two monitoring tasks interfered with   each  other much more when the stimuli on  both  tasks were in the same sense modality  (visual or auditory). McLeod (1977) found   that response similarity was important. His   participants performed a continuous tracking   task with manual,Explores how emotion influences cognition.,"awareness, recognition, attention",Nested under Chapter on perception,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in emotion,Aligned with contemporary studies on emotion,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_1186,"1973) found 

that two monitoring tasks interfered with 

each 
other much more when the stimuli on 
both 
tasks were in the same sense modality 
(visual or auditory). McLeod (1977) found 

that response similarity was important. His 

participants performed a continuous tracking 

task with manual responding together with 

a tone-identi˚ cation task. Some participants 

responded vocally to the tones, whereas others 

responded with the hand not involved in the 

tracking task. Performance on the tracking 

task was worse with high response similarity 

( manual responses on both tasks) than with low 

response similarity (manual responses on one 

task and vocal ones on the other). An issue that 

is hard to resolve is how to measure similarity. 

For example, how similar are piano playing 

and poetry writing?
We all know the saying, ﬁPractice makes 
perfectﬂ. Support for this commonsensical say-

ing was reported by Spelke, Hirst, and Neisser 

(1976). Two students (Diane and John) received 

˚
 ve hours™ training a week for four months on 
various tasks. Their ˚
 rst task was to read short 
stories for comprehension while writing down 

words to dictation, which they initially found 

very hard. After six weeks of training, however, 

they could read as rapidly and with as much 

comprehension when taking dictation as when 
processes in each sensory modality operate 

independently of those in all other modalities.
What are the limitations of research on 
cross-modal effects? First, there has been much 

more research on cross-modal effects in spatial 

attention than on such effects in the 
identiÞ ca-

tion
 of stimuli and objects. Thus, we know little 

about how information from different modalit-

ies is combined to facilitate object recognition. 

Second, our theoretical understanding has lagged 

behind the accumulation of empirical ˚
 ndings. 
For example, it is generally not possible to 

predict ahead of time how strong any cross-

modal effects are "
Segment_326,"likely to be. Third, much of   the research has involved complex, arti˚  cial tasks  and it would be useful to investigate cross-  modal effects in more naturalistic conditions.

PERFORMANCE
Our lives are becoming busier and busier. As 
a consequence, we spend much time multi-

tasking: trying to do two (or even more!) things 

at the same time. How successful we are at 

multi-tasking obviously depends very much on 

the two ﬁthingsﬂ or tasks in question. Most of 

us can easily walk and have a conversation at 

the same time, but ˚ nd it surprisingly dif˚
 cult 
to rub our stomach with one hand while patting  

our head with the other.
There has been a huge amount of research 
using the dual-task approach to assess our ability 

(or inability!) to perform two tasks at the same 

time. In essence, we can ask people to perform 

two tasks (a and b) together or separately. 

What generally happens is that performance 

on one or both tasks is worse when they 

are performed together (dual-task condition) 

than separately (single-task condition). In what 

follows, we will be considering the main factors 

in˜
 uencing dual-task performance. Note that 
the dual-task approach is also considered towards 

the end of this chapter (in much of the section 

on automatic processing) and in the section on 

working memory in Chapter 6.

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
Spelke et al. (1976) found that practice can 
produce a dramatic improvement in people™s 
ability to perform two tasks together. However, 

it is not clear how to interpret their ˚
 ndings, 
for two reasons. First, they focused on accuracy 
only reading. After further training, Diane and 

John learned to write down 
the names of the 

categories to which the dictated 
words belonged 
while maintaining normal 
reading speed and 
comprehension.

Strayer and Johnston (2001) studied the potential 

dangers of drivers using mobile phones with a 

simulated-driving task in which the participants 

braked as rapidly as possible when they detected 

a red light.This task was carried out on its own 

or while the participants conducted a conversation 

using a hand-held or hands-free mobile phone.
What did Strayer and Johnston (2001) ˚
 nd? 
First, performance on the driving task was the 

same in the hand-held and hands-free conditions. 

Second, participants missed more red lights 

when using a mobile phone at the same time 

(7% versus 3%, respectively).Third, the mean 

response time to the red light was 50 ms longer 

in the mobile-phone conditions.This may sound 

trivial. However, it translates into travelling an 

extra 5 feet (1.5 metres) before stopping for a 

motorist doing 70 mph (110 kph).This could 

mean the difference between stopping just short 

of a child in the road or killing that child.
Further evidence that driving performance 
is very easily disrupted was reported by Levy, 

Pashler, and Boer (2006) in a study involving 

simulated driving. Participants pressed a brake 

pedal when the brake lights of the car in front 

came on.This task was performed on its own 

or at the same time as a secondary task. In the 

latter, dual-task conditions, participants responded 

manually or vocally to the number of times (one 

or two) that a visual or auditory stimulus was 

presented.The addition of this apparently very 

simple second task increased the time taken to 

press the brake by 150 ms. Levy et al. argued 

that some of the processing of each task was 

done in a serial fashion because of the existence  

of a central-processing bottleneck (discussed in 

more detail later).
Strayer and Drews (2007) investigated the 
effects of hands-free mobile-phone use on 
driving performance.They hypothesised that 

mobile-phone use by drivers produces a form 

of inattentional blindness (dis"
Segment_328,"cussed in Chapter 4)    in which objects are simply not seen. In one   experiment, 30 objects of varying importance   to drivers (e.g., pedestrians; advertising hoardings)    were clearly in view as participants performed   a simulated driving task.This task was followed   by an unexpected test of r",Explores how emotion influences cognition.,"emotion, memory, awareness",Nested under Chapter on emotion,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in emotion,Aligned with contemporary studies on perception,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_488,"cussed in Chapter 4)  

in which objects are simply not seen. In one 

experiment, 30 objects of varying importance 

to drivers (e.g., pedestrians; advertising hoardings)  

were clearly in view as participants performed 

a simulated driving task.This task was followed 

by an unexpected test of recognition memory 

for the objects. Participants who had used a 

mobile phone on the driving task performed 

much worse on the recognition-memory task 

regardless of the importance of the objects. 

Strikingly, these ˚ ndings were obtained even 

for objects
 
˚ xated during the driving task.This 
suggests the problem was one of inattentional 

blindness rather than simply a question of not 

looking at the objects.
Strayer and Drews (2007) obtained additional  
evidence that mobile-phone use interferes with 

attention in another experiment. Participants 

responded as rapidly as possible to the onset 

of the brake lights on the car in front. Strayer 

and Drews recorded event-related potentials 

(ERPs; see Glossary), focusing mainly on P300. 

This is a positive wave occurring 300 ms after 

stimulus onset that is sensitive to attention.The 

key ˚ nding was that the magnitude of the P300 

was reduced by 50% in mobile-phone users.
In sum, the various ˚ ndings indicate that it 
is surprisingly dif˚ cult for people to perform 

two tasks at the same time even when the tasks 

are apparently very different (verbal processing 

versus visual processing).That is still the case 

when one of the tasks is extremely simple 

and only involves deciding whether a stimulus 

has been presented once or twice.Theoretical 

explanations of such ˚ ndings are discussed in 

the main text.

Central capacity vs. multiple 
resources
How can we explain the typical ˚
 nding that 
performance levels are lower when tasks are 
paired than when they are performed separately?  

A simple (dangerously simple!) approach (e.g., 

Kahneman, 1973) is to assume that some central 

capacity (e.g., central executive; attention) can 

be used ˜ exibly across a wide range of activities. 

This central capacity has strictly limited resources. 

The extent to which two tasks can be performed 

together depends on the demands each task 

makes on those resources. We could potentially 

explain why driving performance is impaired 

when drivers use a mobile phone by assuming 

that both tasks require use of the same central 

capacity.
Bourke, Duncan, and Nimmo-Smith (1996)  
tested central capacity theory. They used four 

tasks designed to be as different as possible and 

to vary in their demands on central capacity:
measures which can be less sensitive than speed 

measures to dual-task interference (Lien, Ruthruff, 

& Johnston, 2006). Second, the reading task 

gave Diane and John ˜ exibility in terms of 
when
 
they attended to the reading matter, and such 

˜
 exibility means they may well have alternated 
attention between tasks. More controlled research  

on the effects of practice on dual-task perform-

ance is discussed later in the chapter.
Not surprisingly, the ability to perform 
two tasks together depends on their dif˚
 culty. 
Sullivan (1976) used the tasks of shadowing 

(repeating back out loud) an auditory message 

and detecting target words on a non-shadowed 

message at the same time. When the shadowing 

task was made harder by using a less redundant 

message, fewer targets were detected on the 

non-shadowed message.
Sometimes the effects of task similarity 
swamp those of task dif˚ culty. Segal and Fusella

or auditory) with signal detection (visual or

et al. (1996). In addition, we will shortly see 
that brain-imaging studies have supported the 

view that dual-task performance depends in 

part on some central capacity. However, central 

capacity theory possesses various limitations. 

First, there is a danger of circularity. We can 

ﬁexplainﬂ dual-task interference by assuming 

the resources of some central capacity have 

been exceeded, and we can account for a lack 

of interference by assuming the two tasks did 

not exceed those resources. However, this is 

often simply a re-description of the ˚
 ndings 
rather than an explanation. Second, evidence 

for the existence of a central capacity does 

not necessarily clarify the nature of that cen-

tral capacity (e.g., Bourke et al., 1996). Third, 

interference effects in dual-task situations can 

be caused by response selection (Hegarty et al., 

2000) or by task similarity (e.g., Segal & 

Fusella, 1970), as well as by task demands on 

central capacity. Fourth, this theoretical approach 

implicitly assumes that all participants use the 

same strategies in dual-task situations. This 

assumption is probably wrong. Lehle, Steinhauser, 

and Hubner (2009) trained participants to 

engage in serial or parallel processing when"
Segment_331,"per-  forming two tasks at the same time. Participants   using serial processing performed better than   those using parallel processing. However, they   found the tasks more effortful, and this was   supported by heart-rate measures.

forming two tasks at the same time. Participants 

using serial processing performed better than 

those using parallel processing. However, they 

found the tasks more effortful, and this was 

supported by heart-rate measures.
Some theorists (e.g., Wickens, 1984) have 
argued that the processing system consists of 

independent processing mechanisms in the form 

of multiple resources. If so, it is clear why the 

degree of similarity between two tasks is so 

important. Similar tasks compete for the same 

speci˚
 c resources, and thus produce interfer-
ence, whereas dissimilar tasks involve different 

resources and so do not interfere.
Wickens (1984) put forward a three-
dimensional structure of human processing 

resources (see Figure 5.17). According to his 

model, there are three successive stages of 

processing (encoding, central processing, and 

responding). Encoding involves the perceptual 

processing of stimuli, and typically involves 

the visual or auditory modality. Encoding and

Participants performed two of these tasks 
together, with one task being identi˚
 ed as more 
important. Bourke et al. (1996) predicted that 

the task making greatest demands on central 

capacity (the random generation task) would 

interfere most with all the other tasks. They 

also predicted that the least demanding task 

(the tone task) would interfere least with all 

the other tasks. The ˚ ndings largely con˚
 rmed 
these predictions regardless of whether the 

instructions identi˚ ed these tasks as more or 

less important than the task with which they 

were paired"

They had previous evidence suggesting that 

a paper-folding task (imagining the effect of 

punching a hole through a folded piece of 

paper) required more central capacity than 

an identical-pictures task (deciding which test 

˚
 gure was identical to a target ˚
 gure). They 
predicted that requiring participants to perform 

another task at the same time (e.g., random 

number generation) would disrupt performance  

on the paper-folding task more than on the 

identical-pictures task. In fact, the ˚
 ndings were 
the opposite. According to Hegarty et al., tasks 

involving much response selection are more 

readily disrupted than ones that do not. The 

identical-˚
 gures task involved much more 
response selection than the paper-folding task, 

and that was why its performance suffered 

much more under dual-task conditions.
The notion of a central capacity is consistent  
with many ˚ ndings, such as those of Bourke

making use of different resources. However, 
the model has some limitations. First, it focuses 

only on visual and auditory inputs or stimuli, 

but tasks can be presented in other modalities 

(e.g., touch). Second, there is often some dis-

ruption to performance even when two tasks 

involve different modalities (e.g., Treisman 

&Davies, 1973). Third, the model implicitly 

assumes that a given strategy is used when 

individuals perform two tasks at the same time. 

However, as we saw earlier, there is evidence 

that performance and effort both depend on 

whether individuals engage in serial or parallel 

processing (Lehle et al., 2009). Fourth, Wickens™

brain-imaging research is discussed in the next 

section.
Synthesis
Some theorists (e.g., Baddeley, 1986, 2001) have 

argued for an approach involving a synthesis 

of the central capacity and multiple-resource 

notions (see Chapter 6). According to Baddeley, 

the processing system has a hierarchical struc-

ture. The central executive (involved in attentional 

control) is at the top of the hierarchy and is 
central processing can involve spatial or verbal 

codes. Finally, responding involves manual or 

vocal responses. There are two key theoretical 

assumptions:
There are several pools of resources based 
(1) 
on the distinctions among stages of pro-

cessing, modalities, codes, and responses.

If two tasks make use of different pools 
(2) 
of resources, then people should be able 

to perform both tasks without disruption.
What is the de˚ nition of a ﬁresourceﬂ?
 
According to W
ickens (2002), there are three 
main criteria. First, each resource should have 

an identi˚ able manifestation within the brain. 

Second, there should be evidence from real-

world dual-task situations that each resource 

accounts for some interference effects. Third, 

each resource should be easily identi˚
 able by 
system designers trying to change systems to 

reduce resource competition.
There is much support for this multiple-
resource model and its prediction that several 

kinds of task similarity in˜
 uence dual-task per-
formance. For example, there is more interference  

when two tasks share the same modality (Treisman 

& Davies, 1973) or the same type of response 

(McLeod, 1977). In addition, brain-imaging 

research indicates that tasks very different from 

each other often involve activation in widely 

separated brain areas. This su"

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
What do the above ˚ ndings mean? They 
suggest that the need to distribute a limited 
central capacity (e.g., attention) across two 

tasks meant the amount each could receive was  

reduced compared to the single-task condition. 

Newman, Keller, and Just (2007) used similar 

tasks to Just et al. (2001) and obtained similar 

˚
 ndings. They explained their ˚ ndings as follows: 
ﬁThere is an interdependence among cortical 

regions in how much activation they can sustain 

at a given time, probably because of the resource 

demands that they conjointly make during 

the performance of a cognitive taskﬂ (Newman 

et al., 2007, p. 114). We can see this most clearly 

with respect to the comprehension task. There 

was much activation within both temporal 

lobes when this task was performed on its own,  

but there was a dramatic reduction in right-

hemisphere temporal activation under dual-task 

conditions. This probably happened because 

participants did not have the resources to engage 

in elaborative processing of the sentences in the 

dual-task condition.
Executive functioning
Some theorists (e.g., Collette, Hogge, Salmon, 

& van der Linden, 2006) have argued that 

dual-task performance often involves executive 

functioning. They de˚
 ned executive functioning 
as, ﬁhigh-level processes, the main function of 

which is to facilitate adaptation to new or 

complex situations.ﬂ Examples of executive pro-

cesses in dual-task situations are co-ordination

involved in the co-ordination and control of 

behaviour. Below this level are speci˚
 c processing  
mechanisms (phonological loop; visuo-spatial 

sketchpad) operating relatively independently 

of each other.
Cognitive neuroscience
The simplest approach to understanding dual-

task performance is to assume that the demands 

for resources of two tasks performed together 

equal the sum of the demands of the two tasks 

performed separately. We can apply that assump-

tion to brain-imaging research in which parti-

cipants perform tasks 
x
 and 
y
 on their own or 

together. If the assumption is correct, we might 

expect that brain activation in the dual-task con-

dition would simply be the sum of the activations 

in the two single-task conditions. As we will see,  

actual ˚
 ndings rarely correspond closely to that 
expectation.
Just, Carpenter, Keller, Emery, Zajac, and 
Thulborn (2001) used two tasks performed 

together or on their own. One task was auditory 

sentence comprehension and the other task 

involved mentally rotating three-dimensional 

˚
 gures to decide whether they were the same. 
These tasks were selected deliberately in the 

expectation that they would involve different 

processes in different parts of the brain.
What did Just et al. (2001) ˚
nd? First, per-
formance on both tasks was impaired under dual-

task conditions compared to single-task conditions.  

Second, the language task mainly activated parts 

of the temporal lobe, whereas the mental rotation 

task mostly activated parts of the parietal lobe. 

Third, and most importantly, Just et al. com-

pared the brain activation associated with each 

task under single- and dual-task conditions. Brain

and a selective attention condition in which 
they attended to only one modality.
What did Johnson and Zatorre (2006) dis-
cover? Only divided attention was associated 

with activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal 

cortex (see Figure 5.18). That suggests that this 

brain area (known to be involved in various 

executive processes) is needed to handle the 

demands of co-ordinating two tasks at the same  

time but is not required for selective attention. 

However, the Þ ndings do not show that the 

dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is
 required
 for 

dual-task performance. More direct evidence 

was reported by Johnson, Strafella, and Zatorre 

(2007) using the same auditory and visual tasks 

as Johnson and Zatorre (2006). They used trans-

cranial magnetic stimulation (TMS; see Glossary) 

to disrupt the functioning of the dorsolateral 

prefrontal cortex. As predicted, this impaired 

the ability of participants to divide their attention 

between the two tasks. Johnson et al. specu-

lated that the dorsolateral 
prefrontal cortex is 
ever, they did not consider dual-task research 

directly.
It is puzzling from the above perspective 
that the brain-imaging studies considered so 

far have not shown that executive functioning 

is important in dual-task situat"
Segment_337,"ions. However,   what was actually found was that activation   within the prefrontal cortex was no greater in   dual-task than in single-task conditions. Thus,   it is possible that there were relatively high   levels of prefrontal activation with single tasks.   Evidence that executive functioning",Explores how memory influences cognition.,"attention, awareness, perception",Nested under Chapter on recognition,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in attention,Aligned with contemporary studies on attention,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_991,"ions. However, 

what was actually found was that activation 

within the prefrontal cortex was no greater in 

dual-task than in single-task conditions. Thus, 

it is possible that there were relatively high 

levels of prefrontal activation with single tasks. 

Evidence that executive functioning within 

the prefrontal cortex is important in dual-task 

situations might be obtained if the two tasks 

individually made minimal demands on such 

functioning. This strategy was adopted by 

Johnson and Zatorre (2006). They carried out

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
Attentional blink
One of the main limitations with much dual-task 
research is that the tasks used do not permit 

detailed assessment of the underlying processes 

(e.g., attention). This has led to the develop-

ment of various tasks, including the attent"
Segment_338,"ional    blink task. On this task, observers are presented   with a series of rapidly presented visual stimuli.   In the crucial condition, observers try to detect   two different targets.

blink task. On this task, observers are presented 

with a series of rapidly presented visual stimuli. 

In the crucial condition, observers try to detect 

two different targets. There is an 
attentional 

blink
, which is a reduced ability to perceive 

and respond to the second visual target when 

it is presented very shortly after the ˚
 rsttarget. 
More speci˚ cally, the second target often goes 

undetected when it follows the ˚ rst target by 

200 Œ500 ms, with distractor stimuli being 

presented during the interval.
What causes the attentional blink? It has 
generally been assumed that observers devote 

most of their available attentional resources 

to the ˚ rst target and thus have insuf˚
 cient 
remaining resources to devote to the second 

target (see Olivers, 2007, for a review). However, 

Olivers (p. 14) identi˚ ed a problem with this 

explanation: ﬁHumans probably would not 

have survived for long if our attention had 

been knocked out for half a second each time 

we saw something relevant.ﬂ According to 

Olivers, what is crucial is the presence of 

distractors. When someone is attending to the 

˚
 rst target and a distractor is presented, he/she 
strongly suppresses processing of further input 

to keep irrelevant information out of conscious 

awareness. This suppression effect can be applied 

mistakenly to the second target and thus cause 

the attentional blink.
How can we distinguish between the limited 
capacity and suppression accounts? Suppose 

we present three targets in succession with no 

intervening distractors. According to the limited 

capacity account, participants should show an 
needed to manipulate 
information in working 
memory in dual-task situations.
Collette, Oliver, van der Linden, Laureys, 
Del˚
 ore, Luxen, and Salmon (2005) presented 
participants with simple visual and auditory 

dis 
crimination tasks. There was a dual-task con-
dition in which both tasks were performed and 

single-task conditions "

or auditory task was performed. Performance was 

worse under dual-task than single-task conditions. 

There was no evidence of prefrontal activation 

speci˚
 cally in response to the single tasks. In the  
dual-task condition, however, there was signi˚
 cant 
activation in various prefrontal and frontal areas 

(e.g., BA9/46, BA10/47, BA6), and the inferior 

parietal gyrus (BA40). Finally, the brain areas 

activated during single-task performance were 

less activated during dual-task performance.
Evaluation
The cognitive neuroscience approach has shown 

that there are substantial differences between 

processing two tasks at the same time versus 

processing them singly. More speci˚
 cally, brain-
imaging research has uncovered two reasons 

why there are often interference effects in dual-

task situations. First, there is a ceiling on the 

processing resources that can be allocated to 

two tasks even when they seem to involve very 

different processes. This is shown by the phe-

nomenon of underadditivity. Second, dual-task 

performance often involves processing demands 

(e.g., task co-ordination) absent from single-task 

performance. This is shown by studies in which 

various prefrontal areas are activated under 

dual-task but not single-task conditions.
What are the limitations of the cogni
tive 
neuroscience approach? First, it is not enti-

rely clear why prefrontal areas are sometimes 

very important in dual-task performance and 

sometimes apparently unimportant. Second, 

prefrontal areas are activated in many complex 

cognitive processes, and it has proved dif˚
 cult 
to identify the 
speciÞ c
 processes responsible 

for activation with any given pair of tasks. 

Third, underadditivity is an important phe-

nomenon, but as yet 
why
 it happens has not 

been established.

ATTENTION 
AND
PERFORMANCE
193
Controlled processes are of limited capacity,
†
require attention, and can be used ˜
 exibly
in changing circumstances.
Automatic processes suffer no capacity
†
limitations, do not require attention, and

are very hard to modify once learned.
This theoretical distinction greatly in˜
 uenced 
many other theorists (see Moors & de Houwer, 

2006, for a review), and we will use the term 

ﬁtraditional approachﬂ to describe their shared
 
views.
Schneider and Shiffrin (1977) used a task 
in which participants memorised up to four 

letters (the memory set) and were then shown 

a visual display containing up to four letters. 

Finally, participants decided rapidly whether 

any of the items in the visual display were the 

same as any of the items in the memory set. The  

crucial manipulation was the type of mapping 
attentional blink because of the allocation of 

attentional resources to the ˚ rst target. According 

to the suppression account, in contrast, there 

should be no suppression effect in the absence 

of distractors and thus no attentional blink. 

Olivers, van der Stigchel, and Hulleman (2007) 

obtained ˚ ndings as predicted by the suppression 

account.
Nieuwenstein, Potter, and Theeuwes (2009) 
carried out a more direct test of the suppression 

account. They compared detection of the second 

target when distractors were presented during 

the time interval between the two targets and 

when the interval was blank. According to the 

suppression account, there should have been no 

attentional blink in the no-distractor condition. 

In fact, there was an attentional blink in that 

condition, although it was less than in the 

distractor condition (see Figure 5.19). Thus, 

the suppression account is only partially correct. 

Nieuwenstein et al. (2009, p. 159) concluded 

that, ﬁThe root cause of the [attentional] blink

engaged once when two targets are presented 

one after the other, which explains why there 

is no attentional blink in that condition (Olivers  

et al., 2007). More generally, our limited ability 

to engage attention twice in a short time period 

helps to explain the dif˚ culties we typically 

have when allocating attention to two tasks 

that are being performed at the same time.
AUTOMATIC PROCESSING
A key ˚
 nding in studies of divided attention is 
the dramatic improvement practice often has 

on performance. This improvement has been 

explained by assuming that some processing 

activities become automatic through prolonged 

practice. There was a strong emphasis on the 

notion of automatic processes in classic articles 

by Shiffrin and Schneider (1977) and Schneider 

and Shiffrin (1977). They drew a theoretical 

distinction between controlled and automatic 

processes:

when it was presented for 100 ms. From Nieuwenstein

with the consonants B to L forming one set 

and the consonants Q to Z forming the other 

set. As before, items from only one set were 

always used in the construction of the memory 

set, and the distractors in the visual display 

were all selected from the other set. There 

was a great improvement in performance over 

2100 trials, re˜ ecting the growth of automatic 

processes.
The greatest limitation with automatic 
processes is their 
inß exibility
, which disrupts 

performance when conditions change. This was 

con˚
 rmed in the second part of the study. The 
initial 2100 trials with one consistent mapping 

were followed by a further 2100 trials with 

the 
reverse
 consistent mapping. This reversal 
of the mapping conditions greatly disrupted 

performance. Indeed, it took nearly 1000 trials 

before performance recovered to its level at the 

very start of the experiment!
Shiffrin and Schneider (1977) carried out 
further experiments in which participants initially 

located target letters anywhere in a visual display. 

Subsequently, they detected targets in one part 

of the display and ignored targets elsewhere. 

Participants were less able to ignore part of 

the visual display when they had developed 
used. With
 consistent
 mapping, only consonants 
were used as members of the memory set and 

only numbers were used as distractors in the 

visual display (or vice versa). Thus, a participant 

given only consonants to memorise would know 

that any consonant detected in the visual display  

must be an item from the memory set. With 

varied
 mapping, a mixture of numbers and 
con-
sonants was used to form the memory set and 

to provide distractors in the visual display.

ATTENTION 
AND
PERFORMANCE
195
A ˚
nal problem with the traditional 
approach is that it is descriptive rather than 
explanatory. For example, Shiffrin and Schneider™s 

(1977) assumption that some processes become 

automatic with practice is uninformative about 

what is actually happening. More speci˚
 cally, 
how
 does the serial processing associated with 

controlled processing turn into the parallel pro-

cessing associated with automatic processing?
Moors and De Houwer
Moors and De Houwer (2006) argued that we 

should de˚ ne ﬁautomaticityﬂ in terms of various 

features distinguishing it from non-automaticity. 

They initially considered eight possible features:  

unintentional; goal independent; uncontrolled /

uncontrollable; autonomous (meaning ﬁuncon-

trolled in terms of every possible goalﬂ (p. 307)); 

purely stimulus drive"
Segment_344,"n; unconscious; ef˚  cient  (consuming little attentional capacity or few pro-  cessing resources); and fast. However, a theor-  etical and conceptual analysis suggested that   several features (i.e., unintentional; goal inde-  pendent; uncontrolled; autonomous; and purely   stimulus driven) overlap",Explores how attention influences cognition.,"memory, perception, attention",Nested under Chapter on memory,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in perception,Aligned with contemporary studies on attention,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_53,"n; unconscious; ef˚
 cient 
(consuming little attentional capacity or few pro-

cessing resources); and fast. However, a theor-

etical and conceptual analysis suggested that 

several features (i.e., unintentional; goal inde-

pendent; uncontrolled; autonomous; and purely 

stimulus driven) overlapped considerably with 

each other in that they all implied being goal-

unrelated. Accordingly, their four features for 

ﬁautomaticityﬂ are as follows: goal-unrelated; 

unconscious; ef˚ cient (i.e., using few resources);  

and fast.
Moors and De Houwer argued that the 
above four features associated with automaticity 

are not always found together: ﬁIt is dangerous 

to draw inferences about the presence or absence 

of one feature on the basis of the presence or 

absence of anotherﬂ (p. 320). They also argued 

that there is no ˚ rm dividing line between 

automaticity and non-automaticity. The features 

are gradual rather than all-or-none (e.g., a 
automatic processes than when they had made 

use of controlled search processes.
In sum, automatic processes function rapidly 
and in parallel but suffer from in˜
 exibility. 
Controlled processes are ˜ exible and versatile but 

operate relatively slowly and in a serial fashion.
Problems with the traditional 
approach
It was sometimes assumed within the traditional 
approach (e.g., Shiffrin & Schneider, 1977) that 

any given process is controlled or automatic. 

It was also assumed that automatic processes 

generally possess various features (e.g., they 

do not require attention; they are fast; they are 

unavailable to consciousness). In other words, 

the main features co-occur when participants 

performing a given task are using automatic 

processes.
Problems with the traditional approach 
can be seen in some of Shiffrin and Schneider™s 

˚
 ndings. According to their theory, automatic 
processes operate in parallel and place no 

demands on attentional capacity. Thus, there 

should be a slope of zero (i.e.,"
Segment_345,"a horizontal   line) in the function relating decision speed to   the number of items in the memory set and /or   in the visual display when automatic processes   are used. In fact, decision speed was slower   when the memory set and the visual display   both contained several items (see Figure 5.2",Explores how recognition influences cognition.,"attention, awareness, memory",Nested under Chapter on attention,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in recognition,Aligned with contemporary studies on awareness,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_1193," a horizontal 

line) in the function relating decision speed to 

the number of items in the memory set and /or 

in the visual display when automatic processes 

are used. In fact, decision speed was slower 

when the memory set and the visual display 

both contained several items (see Figure 5.20).
The 
Stroop effect
, in which the naming 
of the colours in which words are printed is 

slowed down by using colour words (e.g., the 

word YELLOW printed in red) has often been 

assumed to involve automatic processing of the 

colour words. According to the traditional 

approach, that would imply that attentional 

processes are irrelevant to the Stroop effect. 

Contrary evidence was reported by Kahneman 

and Chajczyk (1983). They used a version of  

the 
Stroop test in which a colour word was 
presented close to a strip of colour, and the 

colour had to be named. This reduced the Stroop  

effect compared to a condition in which the 

colour word and the colour strip were in the 

same location.
Stroop effect:
 the ˚ nding that naming of the 
colours in which words are printed is slower 

when the words are con˜ icting colour words 

(e.g., the word RED printed in green).

and dual-task conditions. There was a gradual 
increase in automaticity with practice, as indexed 

by faster performance and the elimination of 

dual-task interference. There was considerable 

activation in the lateral and dorsolateral regions 

of the prefrontal cortex when participants 

initially performed in dual-task conditions, 

but this reduced substantially with practice. 

However, there was some increase in activation 

within the basal ganglia.
Saling and Phillips (2007) reviewed neuro-
imaging studies of automaticity. Most studies 

found reduced brain activation associated with 

the development of automaticity, "
Segment_346,"and no study   reported an increase in brain activation. There   were variations from study to study in the precise   changes in brain activation as a result of practice.   However, the growth of automaticity is gener-  ally associated with a relative shift away from   cortical activation and toward",Explores how perception influences cognition.,"recognition, memory, emotion",Nested under Chapter on perception,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in attention,Aligned with contemporary studies on recognition,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_299,"and no study 

reported an increase in brain activation. There 

were variations from study to study in the precise 

changes in brain activation as a result of practice. 

However, the growth of automaticity is gener-

ally associated with a relative shift away from 

cortical activation and towards subcortical 

activation (e.g., basal ganglia). As Saling and 

Phillips concluded, ﬁThe acquisition of auto-

maticity can be conceptualised as a shift from 

cortical consideration and hence selection where 

there is a degree of uncertainty to solved, 

simple, direct routing through the basal gangliaﬂ 

(p. 15).
Instance theory
We have seen that there is evidence that auto-

maticity is associated with a gradual reduction 

in the use of attentional resources. However, 

most theories have not specified a learning 

mechanism explaining 
how
 this happens. Logan 
(1988) and Logan, Taylor, and Etherton (1999) 

˚
 lled this gap by putting forward instance 
theory based on the following assumptions:
Obligatory encoding
†
: ﬁWhatever is attended
is encoded into memoryﬂ (Logan et al., 1999,

p.166).

Obligatory retrieval
†
: ﬁRetrieval from long-
term memory is a necessary consequence

of attention. Whatever is attended acts as

a retrieval cue that pulls things associated

with it from memoryﬂ (Logan et al., 1999,

p.166).
process can be fairly fast or fairly slow; it 

can be partially conscious). As a result, most 

processes involve some blend of automaticity 

and non-automaticity. This entire approach is 

rather imprecise in that we generally cannot 

claim that a given process is 100% automatic 

or non-automatic. However, as Moors and De 
Houwer pointed out, we can make relative
 
statements (e.g., process 
x
 is more / less automatic 
than process 
y
).

ated with faster responses. However, it has often 

been harder to provide behavioural evidence 

indicating that automatic processes are goal-

unrelated, unconscious, and ef˚ cient in the sense 

of using little attentional capacity. In that con-

nection, research within cognitive neuroscience 

has provided valuable information. No 
single
 

brain area is uniquely associated with con-

sciousness (see Chapter 16) and the same is true 

of attention. However, the prefrontal cortex 

is of special signi˚ cance with respect to both 

consciousness and attention. If automatic 
pro-
cesses are unconscious and ef˚ cient, we can 

predict that the development of automaticity 

should be associated with reduced activation 

in the prefrontal cortex.
Jansma, Ramsey, Slagter, and Kahn (2001) 
used fMRI to identify the changes taking place 

during the development of automatic processing 

in the consistent mapping condition. Automatic 

processing was associated with reduced usage 

of working memory (see Chapter 6), especially 

its attention-like central executive component. 

Jansma et al. concluded that increased auto-

maticity, ﬁwas accompanied by a decrease in 

activation in regions related to working memo r y 

(bilateral but predominantly left dorsolateral 

prefrontal cortex, right superior frontal cortex, 

and right frontopolar area), and the supple-

mentary motor areaﬂ (p. 730).

It has often been assumed that automaticity 
mainly re˜ ects processes occurring during learn-

ing or encoding. In contrast, the ˚
 ndings of 
Logan et al. (1996) suggest that automaticity 

is also a memory phenomenon. More speci˚
 -
cally, automatic performance depends on the 

relationship between learned information and 

retrieval.
In sum, the greatest strength of instance 
theory is that it speci˚ es a learning mechanism 

that produces automaticity, and that helps to 

explain the various features associated with 

automaticity (e.g., fast responding; few demands 

on attentional resources). However, there is some 

danger of circularity in Logan™s argument: single-

step retrieval is his de˚ nition of automaticity 

and it is also his preferred explanation of the 

phenomenon of automaticity.
Cognitive bottleneck theory
Earlier we discussed research (e.g., Hirst, Spelke, 

Reaves, Caharack, & Neisser, 1980; Spelke et al., 

1976) suggesting that two complex tasks could 

be performed very well 
together with minimal 

disruption. However, the 
participants in those 

studies had considerable ˜
 exibility in terms of 
when
 and 
how
 they 
processed the two tasks. 
Thus, it is entirely possible that there were 

interference effects that went unnoticed because 

of insensitivity of measurement.
We turn now to what is probably the 
most sensitive type of experiment for detecting

ﬁAutomaticity is memory retrieval: per-

a single-step direct-access retrieval of past 

solutions from memoryﬂ (Logan, 1988,
 
p. 493).

In the absence of practice, responding to a 
† 
stimulus requires the application of rules 

and is time-consuming. It involves multi-step 

memory retrieval rather than single-step 

retrieval.
These theoretical assumptions make coherent
 
sense of several characteristics of automaticity. 

Automatic processes are fast because they 

require only the retrieval of past solutions from 

long-term memory. They make few demands 

on attentional resources because the retrieval 

of heavily over-learned information is relatively 

effortless. Finally, there is no conscious aware-

ness of automatic processes because no signi˚
 cant 
processes intervene between the presentation 

of a stimulus and the retrieval of the appropriate 

response.
Logan (1988, p. 519) summarised instance 
theory as follows: ﬁNovice performance is 

limited by a lack of knowledge rather than a 

lack of resources. . . . Only the knowledge base 

changes with practice.ﬂ However, the acquisi-

tion of knowledge means that fewer attentional 

or other resources are needed to perform a 

task.
Logan, Taylor, and Etherton (1996) argued 
that knowledge stored in memory as a result 

of prolonged practice may or may not be pro-

duced automatically depending on the precise 

conditions of retrieval. Participants were given 

512 training trials during which any given 

word was always presented in the same colour 

(red or green). The task required them to process 

its colour. After that, there were 32 transfer

but subsequent response selection must occur 

in a serial fashion.
The notion of a processing bottleneck implies 
that a PRP effect will 
always
 be obtained. 

However, Greenwald (2003) found that two 

tasks can be performed at the same time with 

no disruption or interference. One task involved 

vocal responses to auditory stimuli: saying ﬁAﬂ 

or ﬁBﬂ in response to hearing those letter 

names. The other task involved manual responses 

to visual stimuli: moving a joystick to the left 

to an arrow pointing left and moving it to the 

right to an arrow pointing right. Both tasks used 

by Greenwald possess a very direct relationship 

between stimuli and responses (e.g., saying ﬁAﬂ 

when you hear ﬁAﬂ and saying ﬁBﬂ when you 

hear ﬁBﬂ). According to Greenwald (2004), 

two tasks can readily be performed together if 

they both involve 
direct
 stimulusŒresponse 

relationships. It could be argued that, in those 

circumstances, there is little or no need for 

response selection (Spence, 2008).
Findings that are more problematical for 
the notion of a bottleneck were reported by 

Schumacher et al. (2001). They used two 

t asks: 
(1) say ﬁoneﬂ, ﬁtwoﬂ, or ﬁthreeﬂ to low-,  
medium-, and high-pitched tones, respectively; 

(2) press response keys corresponding to the 

position of a disc on a computer screen. These 

two tasks were performed together for a total 

of 2064 trials, at the end of which some 

participants performed them as well together 

as singly. Schumacher et al. found substantial 

individual differences in the amount of dual-

task interference. In one experiment, there 

was a correlation of 
+
0.81 between dual-task 
dual-
task interference. In studies on the psycho-

logical 
refractory period, there are two stimuli 
(e.g., 
two lights) and two responses (e.g., button 
presses). Participants respond to each stimulus 

as rapidly as possible. When the second stimulus

is generally a marked slowing of the response 

to the second stimulus. This is known as the 

psychological refractory period (PRP) effect
 

(see Pashler et al., 2001). This effect does 
not
 

occur simply because people have little previous  

experience in responding to two immediately 

successive stimuli. Pashler (1993) discussed 

one of his studies in which the PRP effect was 

still observable after more than 10,000 practice 

trials.
How can we explain this effect? According 
to the central bottleneck theory of Welford 
(1952)  

and Pashler, Johnston, and Ruthroff (2001), 

there is a 
bottleneck in the processing system. 

This bottle 
neck makes it impossible for two 
decisions 
about the appropriate responses to two 
different 
stimuli to be made at the same time. 
Thus, 
response selection inevitably occurs in a 
serial fashion, and this creates a bottleneck in pro-

cessing even after prolonged practice. According 

to Pashler et al. (2001, p. 642), ﬁThe PRP effect  

arises from the postponement of central pro-

cessing stages in the second task Œ a processing 

bottleneck . . . central stages in task 2 cannot 

commence until corresponding stages of the ˚
 rst 
task have been completed, whereas perceptual 

and motoric stages in the two tasks can overlap 

without constraint.ﬂ
Evidence that the PRP effect occurs because 
response selection requires serial processing 

was reported by Sigman and Dehaene (2008). 

Participants performed an auditory and a visual 

task at the same time, and performance revealed 

a PRP effect. Data from fMRI and EEG sug-

gested that this effect was due to processes 

occurring at the time of response selection. 

More speci˚ cally, the timing of activation in a 

bilateral parieto-frontal network involved in 

response selection correlated with the delay in 

responding to the second stimulus (i.e., the PRP 

effect). In contrast, brain activation associated

trials. Thus, those who performed each 
task on its own particularly well were least 

affected by dual-task interference.
The experiment by Schumacher et al. (2001)  
was exceptional in ˚ nding an absence of dis-

ruption, even though neither task involved 

direct stimulusŒresponse relationships. However, 

this atypical ˚ nding only occurred after very 

extensive practice Œ there was substantial dis-

ruption under dual-task conditions early in 

practice.
One limitation in the study by Schumacher 
et al. was that their second task (pressing keys to  

discs) was so simple it did not require the use 

of central processes. Hazeltine, Teague, and Ivry 

(2000) re
plicated and extended the ˚
 ndings of 
Schumacher et 
al. that were obtained some time 
previously but published in 2001. Of special 

importance, they found very little dual-task inter-

ference even when the discŒkey press task was 

made more dif˚
 cult.
Evaluation
The evidence from most (but not all) studies 

of the psychological refractory period indicates 

that there is a bottleneck and that response 

selection occurs in a serial fashion. However, 

the size of the PRP effect is typically not very 

large, suggesting that many processes (e.g., early 

sensory processes; response execution) do 
not
 
operate in a serial fashion.
We have seen that some studies (e.g., 
Schumacher et al., 2001) have reported no PRP 

effect. For the most part, such studies have used 

simple tasks involving direct stimulusŒ

relationships (Greenwald, 2003,

The studies by Schumacher et al. (2001) and 

by Hazeltine et al. (2000) suggest it may be 

possible, but we need more research.
Focused auditory attention
†
Initial research on focused auditory attention with the shadowing task suggested that

there was very limited processing of unattended stimuli. However, there can be extensive

processing of unattended stimuli, especially when they are dissimilar to the attended ones.

There has been a controversy between early- and late-selection theorists as to the location

of a bottleneck in processing. More evidence favours early-selection theories with some

˜
 exibility as to the stage at which selection occurs.
Focused visual attention
†
There are two attentional systems. One is stimulus-driven and is located in a right-

hemisphere ventral fronto-parietal network, and the other is goal-directed and is located

in a dorsal fronto-parietal network. The two systems interact. For example, salient

task-irrelevant stimuli are most likely to attract attention when they resemble task-

relevant stimuli. V
isual attention has been compared to a spotlight or zoom lens, but can
resemble multiple spotlights. Visual attention can be location-based or object-based, and

the same is true of inhibition of return. Unattended visual stimuli are often processed

fairly thoroughly, with some of the strongest evidence coming from neglect patients.

According to Lavie, we are more susceptible to distraction when our current task involves

low perceptual load and 
/ 
or high load on executive cognitive control 
functions (e.g.,
working memory).

Neglect is often attributed to an impairment of the stimulus-driven system. Extinction 
occurs mostly when an ipsilesional stimulus captures attention in competition with a 

contralesional stimulus. Extinction is reduced when two stimuli are integrated and so do 

not compete with each other. Prisms that shift the visual ˚
 eld to the right reduce the 
symptoms of neglect. Research on brain-damaged patients has provided evidence for three 

components of visual attention: disengagement, shifting, and engagement. Posner and 

Petersen (1990) have identi˚ ed the brain areas associated with each component.
 Visual search
† 
According to feature integration theory, object features are processed in parallel and are 

then combined by focused attention. Factors (e.g., grouping of distractors; distractors 

sharing no features with targets) associated with fast detection are missing from feature 

integration theory but are included in guided search theory. Thornton and Gilden (2007) 
found evidence of parallel processing when targets and distractors differed in only one 
feature dimension and of serial processing on complex tasks involving the detection of a 

speci˚
 
c direction of rotation. Visual search tasks used in the laboratory often differ in 
important ways from everyday situations in which visual search is used.
 Cross-modal effects
† 
In the real world, we often need to co-ordinate information from two or more sense 

modalities. Convincing evidence of cross-modal effects has been obtained in studies of 

exogenous and endogenous spatial attention. The ventriloquist illusion shows that vision 

can dominate sound, probably because an object™s location is typically indicated more 

precisely by vision. There is much ﬁmulti-sensory interplayﬂ within the brain because 

neurons responding to input from different modalities are in close proximity
.
 Divided attention: dual-task performance
† 
Driving performance is impaired substantially by a seco"
Segment_355,"ndary task (e.g., mobile-phone   use). Dual-task performance is in˜ uenced by task similarity , practice, and task dif˚  culty.  Central-capacity and multiple-resource theories have been proposed to explain dual-task   performance. Some neuroimaging studies have found underadditivity under dual-task",Explores how awareness influences cognition.,"attention, emotion, memory",Nested under Chapter on perception,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in awareness,Aligned with contemporary studies on emotion,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_951,"ndary task (e.g., mobile-phone 

use). Dual-task performance is in˜ uenced by task similarity
, practice, and task dif˚
 culty. 
Central-capacity and multiple-resource theories have been proposed to explain dual-task 

performance. Some neuroimaging studies have found underadditivity under dual-task 

conditions, suggesting problems in distributing a limited central capacity across the tasks. 

Dual-task conditions can also introduce new processing demands of task co-ordination 

associated with activation within the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The attentional blink 

suggests that impaired dual-task performance is due in part to dif˚ culties in engaging 

attention twice within a short period of time.
 Automatic processing
† 
Shiffrin and Schneider distinguished between slow, controlled processes and fast, automatic 

processes. Automatic processes are typically goal-unrelated, unconscious, ef˚
 cient, and 
fast. Neuroimaging studies suggest that the development of automaticity is associated 

with reduced activation within the prefrontal cortex (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). 

According to instance theory
, automatic processes are fast because they require only the 
retrieval of past solutions from long-term memory. The great majority of relevant 

dual-task studies have found a psychological refractory period effect, which suggests the 

existence of a processing bottleneck. However, the effect is sometimes not found when 

both tasks involve direct stimulusŒresponse relationships.

MEMORY
How important is memory? Imagine if we were 
without it. We wouldn™t recognise anyone or 

anything as familiar. We would be unable to 

talk, read, or write, because we would remem-

ber 
nothing about language. We would have 
extremely limited personalities, because we 

would have no recollection of the events of 

our own lives and therefore no sense of self. 

In sum, we would have the same lack of know-

ledge as newborn babies.
We use memory for numerous purposes 
throughout every day of our lives. It allows us to  

keep track of conversations, to remember tele-

phone numbers while we dial them, to write essays 

in examinations, to "
Segment_357,"make sense of what we read,   to recognise people™s faces, and to understand   what we read in books or see on television. The wonders of human memory are dis- cussed in Chapters 6 Œ 8.

to recognise people™s faces, and to understand 

what we read in books or see on television.
The wonders of human memory are dis-
cussed in Chapters 6 Œ 8. Chapter 6 deals mainly 

with key issues that have been regarded as 

important from the very beginnings of research 

into memory. For example, we consider the 

overall architecture of human memory and the 

distinction between short-term and long-term 

memory. We also consider the uses of short-

term memory in everyday life. Another topic 

discussed in that chapter is learning, includ-

ing evidence suggesting that some learning is 

implicit (i.e., does not depend on conscious 

processes). 
Finally, we deal with forgetting. 
Why is it 
that we tend to forget information 

as time goes by?
When we think about long-term memory, 
it is obvious that its scope is enormous. We 

have long-term memories for personal informa-
tion about ourselves and those we know, know-

ledge about language, much knowledge about 

psychology (hopefully!), and knowledge about 

thousands of objects in the world around us. 

The key issue addressed in Chapter 7 is how 

to account for this incredible richness. At one 

time, many psychologists proposed theories in 

which there was a single long-term memory 

store. However, it is now almost universally 

acknowledged that there are several long-term 

memory systems. As we will see in Chapter 7, 

some of the most convincing evidence supporting 

that position has come from patients whose brain 

damage has severely impaired their long-term 

memory.
Memory is important in everyday life in 
ways that historically have not been the focus 

of much research. For example, autobiographical 

memory is of great signi˚ cance to all of us. 

Indeed, we would lose our sense of self and 

life would lose most of its meaning if we lacked 

memory for the events and experiences that 

have shaped our personalities. Autobiograph-

ical memory is one of the topi"

Chapter 8. Other topics on everyday memory 

considered in that chapter are eyewitness 

testimony and prospective memory. Research 

into eyewitness testimony is of considerable

It has revealed that many of the assumptions 

we make about the accuracy of eyewitness 

testimony are mistaken. This matters because 

hundreds or even thousands of innocent people 

have been imprisoned solely on the basis of 

eyewitness testimony.

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
What happens at encoding varies as a function 
of task instructions, the immediate context, 

participants™ strategies, and many other factors.  

Finally, memory performance at retrieval often 

varies considerably depending on the nature 

of the memory task (e.g., free recall; cued recall; 

recognition).
The crucial message of the above approach 
is that memory ˚ ndings are context-sensitive 

Œthey depend on interactions among the four

factors. In other words, the effects of manipu-

lating, say, what happens at encoding depend 

on the participants used, the events to be 

remembered, and on the conditions of retrieval. 

As a result, we should not expect to ˚
 ndmany 
(if any) laws of memory that hold under all 

circumstances. How, then, do we make pro-

gress? As Baddeley (1978, p. 150) pointed 

out, what is required is ﬁto develop ways of 

separating out and analysing more deeply the 

complex underlying processes.ﬂ
When we think about memory, we naturally 
focus on memory for what has happened in the 

past. However, most of us have to remember 

numerous future commitments (e.g., meeting 

a friend as arranged; turning up for a lecture), 

and such remembering involves prospective 

memory. We will consider the ways in which 

people try to ensure that they carry out their 

future intentions.

LEARNING, MEMORY, 
AND FORGETTING
ARCHITECTURE OF 
MEMORY
Throughout most of the history of memory 
research, it has been assumed that there is an 

important distinction between short-term memory 

and long-term memory. It seems reasonable that 

the processes involved in brie˜
 y remembering 
a telephone number are very different from those  

involved in long-term memory for theories and 

research in psychology. This traditional view 

is at the heart of multi-store models, which are 

discussed initially. In recent times, however, some 

theorists have argued in favour of unitary-store 

models in which the distinction between short-

term and long-term memory is much less clear-cut 

than in the tradi tional approach. We will consider 

unitary-store models shortly.
Multi-store model
Several memory theorists (e.g., Atkinson & 

Shiffrin, 1968) have described the basic archi-

tecture of the memory system. We can identify 

a multi-store approach based on the common 

features of their theories. Three types of memory 

store were proposed:
Sensory stores, each holding information

(limited to one sensory modality).

INTRODUCTION
This chapter and the next two are concerned 

with human memory. All three chapters deal with 

intact human memory, but Chapter 7 also con-

siders amnesic patients. Traditional laboratory-

based research is the focus of this chapter, with 

more naturalistic research being discussed in 

Chapter 8. As we will see, there are important 

links among these different types of research. 

Many theoretical issues are relevant to brain-

damaged and healthy individuals whether tested 

in the laboratory or in the ˚
 eld.
Theories of memory generally consider both 
the architecture of the memory system and the 

processes operating within that structure. Archi-

tecture refers to the way in which the memory 

system is organised and processes refer to the 

activities occurring within the memory system.
Learning and memory involve a series of 
stages. Processes occurring during the pres-

entation of the learning material are known as 

ﬁencodingﬂ and involve many of the processes 

involved in perception. This is the ˚ rst stage. As  

a result of encoding, some information is stored 

within the memory system. Thus, storage is the 

second stage. The third (and ˚ nal) stage is retrieval, 

which involves recovering or extracting stored 

information from the memory system.
We have emphasised the distinctions be
tween 
architecture and process and among encoding, 

storage, and retrieval. However, we cannot have 

architecture without process, or retrieval without 

previous encoding and storage.

is transferred to the long-term store. Long-

often depends on

is a direct relationship between 
the amount of rehearsal in the short-term store 

and the strength of the stored memory trace. 

There is much overlap between the areas of 

attention and memory. Broadbent™s (1958) theory 

of attention (see Chapter 5) was the main in˜
 uence 
on the multi-store approach to memory. For 

example, Broadbent™s buffer store resembles 

the notion of a sensory store.
Sensory stores
The visual store is often known as the iconic 

store. In Sperling™s (1960) classic work on this 

store, he presented a visual array containing three 

rows of four letters each for 50 ms. Participants 

could usually report only 4  
Œ5 letters, but claimed 
to have seen many more. Sperling assumed this 

happened because visual information had faded 

before most of it could be reported. He tested 

this by asking participants to recall only 
part
 

of the information presented. Sperling™s results 

supported his assumption, with part recall being 

good provided that the information to be recalled 

was cued very soon after the offset of the visual 

display.
Sperling™s (1960) ˚ ndings suggested that 
information in iconic memory decays within 
about 0.5 seconds, but this may well be an 
under-
estimate. Landman, Spekreijse, and Lamme (2003) 

pointed out that the requirement to verbally 

identify and recall items in the part-recall con-

dition may have interfered with performance. They 

imposed simpler response demands on partici-

pants (i.e., is a second stimulus the same as the 

˚
 rst one?) and found that iconic memory lasted 
for up to about 1600 ms (see Figure 4.12).
Iconic storage is very useful for two reasons. 
First, the mechanisms responsible for visual 

per 
ception always operate on the icon rather 
than directly on the visual environment"
Segment_362,". Second,    information remains in iconic memory for   upwards of 500 ms, and we can shift our   attention to aspects of the information within   iconic memory in approximately 55 ms (Lachter,   Forster, & Ruthruff, 2004; see Chapter 5).

upwards of 500 ms, and we can shift our 

attention to aspects of the information within

Forster, & Ruthruff, 2004; see Chapter 5). 

This helps to ensure we attend to important 

information.
The transient auditory store is known 
as the 
echoic store
. In everyday life, you may 

sometimes have been asked a question while 

your mind was on something else. Perhaps you 

replied, ﬁWhat did you say?ﬂ, just before real-

ising that you do know what had been said. 

This ﬁplaybackﬂ facility depends on the echoic 

store. Estimates of the duration of information 

in the echoic store are typically within the 

range of 2Œ 4 seconds (Treisman, 1964).

, MEMORY, AND FORGETTING 
207
Short- and long-term stores
The capacity of short-term memory is very 
limited. Consider digit span: participants listen 

to a random series of digits and then repeat 

them back immediately in the correct order. 

Other span measures are letter span and word 

span. The maximum number of units (e.g., 

digits) recalled without error is usually ﬁseven 

plus or minus twoﬂ (Miller, 1956). However, 

there are two quali˚ cations concerning that 

˚
 nding. First, Miller (1956) argued that the 
capacity of short-term memory should be 

assessed by the number of 
chunks
 (integrated 

pieces or units of information). For example, 

ﬁIBMﬂ is one chunk for those familiar with 

the company name International Business 

Machines but three chunks for everyone else. 

The capacity of short-term memory is often 

seven chunks rather than seven items. "
Segment_363,"However,   Simon (1974) found that the span in chunks   was less with larger chunks (e.g., eight-word   phrases) than with smaller chunks (e.g., one-  syllable words). Second, Cowan (2000, p. 88) argued that  estimates of short-term memory capacity are   often in˜ ated because participants™ performa",Explores how emotion influences cognition.,"recognition, perception, attention",Nested under Chapter on emotion,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in awareness,Aligned with contemporary studies on perception,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_1252,"However, 

Simon (1974) found that the span in chunks 

was less with larger chunks (e.g., eight-word 

phrases) than with smaller chunks (e.g., one-

syllable words).
Second, Cowan (2000, p. 88) argued that 
estimates of short-term memory capacity are 

often in˜ ated because participants™ performance 

depends in part on rehearsal and on long-term 

memory. When these additional factors are 

largely eliminated, the capacity of short-term 
memory is typically only about four chunks. 

For example, Cowan et al. (2005) used the 

running memory task Œ a series of digits ended 

at an unpredictable point, with the participants™ 

task being to recall the items from the end of 

the list. The digits were presented very rapidly 

to prevent rehearsal, and the mean number of 

items recalled was 3.87.
The 
recency effect
 in free recall (recalling 
the items in any order) refers to the ˚
 nding 
that the last few items in a list are usually much 

better remembered in immediate recall than 

those from the middle of the list. Counting 

backwards for 10 seconds between the end 

of list presentation and start of recall mainly 

affects the recency effect (Glanzer & Cunitz, 

1966; see Figure 6.2). The two or three words 

susceptible to the recency effect may be in the 

short-term store at the end of list presentation 

and so especially vulnerable. However, Bjork

and Whitten (1974) found that there was still 
a recency effect when participants counted 

backwards for 12 seconds after each item in 

the list was presented. According to Atkinson 

and Shiffrin (1968), this should have eliminated 

the recency effect.
The above ˚ ndings can be explained by 
analogy to looking along a row of telephone 

poles. The closer poles are more distinct than 

the ones farther away, just as the most recent 

list words are more discriminable than the 

others (Glenberg, 1987).
Peterson and Peterson (1959) studied the 
duration of short-term memory by using the 

task of remembering a three-letter stimulus 

while counting backwards by threes followed 

by recall in the correct order. Memory perfor-

mance reduced to about 50% after 6 seconds 

and forgetting was almost complete after 18 

seconds (see Figure 6.3), presumably because 

unrehearsed information disappears rapidly 

from short-term memory through decay (see 

Nairne, 2002, for a review). In contrast, it is 

often argued that forgetting from long-term 

memory involves different mechanisms. In parti-

cular, there is much cue-dependent forgetting, 

in which the memory traces are still in the 

memory system but are inaccessible (see later 

discussion).
Nairne, Whiteman, and Kelley (1999) argued 
that the rate of forgetting observed by Peterson 

and Peterson (1959) was especially rapid for 
two reasons. First, they used all the letters of 

the alphabet repeatedly, which may have caused 

considerable interference. Second, the memory 

task was dif˚ cult in that participants had to 

remember the items themselves and the pre-

sentation order. Nairne et al. presented different 

words on each trial to reduce interference, and 

tested memory only for order information and 

not for the words themselves. Even though 

there was a rehearsal-prevention task (reading 

aloud digits presented on a screen) during the

6 LEARNING
, MEMORY, AND FORGETTING 
209
This ˚ nding casts doubt on the notion that 
decay causes forgetting in short-term memory. 

However, reading digits aloud may not have 

totally prevented rehearsal.
Finally, we turn to the strongest evidence that 
short-term and long-term memory are distinct. 

If short-term and long-term memory are separate, 

we might expect to ˚ nd some patients with 

impaired long-term memory but intact short-

term memory and others showing the opposite 

pattern. This would produce a double dissoci-

ation. The ˚ ndings are generally supportive. 

Patients with amnesia (discussed in Chapter 7) 

have severe impairments of 
many aspects of 

long
-term memory, but typically have no prob-

lem with short-term memory (Spiers, Maguire, 

& Burgess, 2001). Amnesic patients have dam-

age to the medial temporal lobe, including the 

hippocampus (see Chapter 7), 
which primarily 

disrupts long-term memory (see 
Chapter 7).
A few brain-damaged patients have severely 
impaired short-term memory but intact long-term 

memory. For example, KF had no problems 

with long-term learning and recall but had a 

very small digit span (Shallice & Warrington, 

1970). Subsequent research indicated that his 

short-term memory problems focused mainly 

on recall of letters, words, or digits rather than 

meaningful sounds or visual stimuli (e.g., Shallice 

& Warrington, 1974). Such p"

(Vallar & Papagno, 2002).
Evaluation
The multi-store approach has various strengths. 

The conceptual distinction between three kinds 

of memory store (sensory store, short-term store, 

and long-term store) makes sense. These memory 

stores differ in several ways:
temporal duration
†
storage capacity
†
forgetting mechanism(s)
†
effects of brain damage
†
Finally, many subsequent theories of human 
memory have built on the foundations of the multi-

store model, as we will see later in this chapter.
However, the multi-store model possesses 
several serious limitations. First, it is very over
-
simpli˚
 ed. It was assumed that the short-term 
and long-term stores are both 
unitary
, i.e., each 

store always operates in a single, uniform way. 

As we will see shortly, Baddeley and Hitch (1974) 

proposed replacing the concept of a single short-

term store with a 
working memory 
system 

consisting of 
three
 different components. That 

is a more realistic approach. In similar fashion, 

there are several long-term memory systems 

(see Chapter 7).
Second, it is assumed that the short-term 
store acts as a gateway between the sensory 

stores and long-term memory (see Figure 6.1). 

However, the information processed in the 

short-term store has already made contact 

with information stored in long-term memory 

(Logie, 1999). For example, consider the phono-

logical similarity effect: immediate recall of 

visually presented words in the correct order 

is worse when they are phonologically similar 

(sounding similar) (e.g., Larsen, Baddeley, & 

Andrade, 2000). Thus, information about the 

sounds of words stored in long-term memory 

affects processing in short-term memory.
Third, Atkinson and Shiffrin (1968) assumed 
that information in short-term memory repres-

ents the ﬁcontents of consciousnessﬂ. This implies 

that only information processed consciously 

can be stored in long-term m"
Segment_367,"emory. However,   learning without conscious awareness of what   has been learned (implicit learning) appears to   exist (see later in the chapter).

However, 

learning without conscious awareness of what 

has been learned (implicit learning) appears to 

exist (see later in the chapter).
Fourth, multi-store theorists assumed that 
most information is transferred to long-term 

memory via rehearsal. However, the role of 

rehearsal in our everyday lives is very limited. 

More generally, multi-store theorists focused 

too much on structural aspects of memory rather 

than on memory processes.
Unitary-store models
In recent years, various theorists have argued 

that the entire multi-store approach is misguided 

and should be replaced by a unitary-store model 

(see Jonides, Lewis, Nee, Lustig, Berman, &

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
Moore, 2008, for a review). Unitary-store models 
assume that, ﬁSTM [short-term memory] con-

sists of temporary activations of LTM [long-term 

memory] representations or of representations 

of items that were recently perceivedﬂ (Jonides 

et al., 2008, p. 198). Such activations will often  

occur when certain representations are the focus 

of attention.
Unitary-store models would seem to have 
great dif˚ culty in explaining the consistent ˚
 nd-
ing that amnesic patients have essentially intact 

short-term memory in spite of having severe 

problems with long-term memory. Jonides et al. 

(2008) argued that amnesic patients have special 

problems in forming novel relations (e.g., between 

items and their context) in both short-term and 

long-term memory. Amnesic patients apparently 

have no problems with short-term memory 

because short-term memory tasks typically do 

not require relational memory. This leads to a 

key prediction: amnesic patients should have 

impaired short-term memory performance on 

tasks requiring relational memory.
According to Jonides et al. (2008), the 
hippocampus and surrounding medial temporal 

lobes (typi"
Segment_368,"cally damaged in amnesic patients)   play a crucial role in forming novel relations   (sometimes called binding) (see Chapter 7).   Multi-store theorists assume that these struc-  tures are much more involved in long-term   memory than in short-term memory.

play a crucial role in forming novel relations 

(sometimes called binding) (see Chapter 7). 

Multi-store theorists assume that these struc-

tures are much more involved in long-term 

memory than in short-term memory. However, 

it follows from unitary-store models that the 

hippocampus and medial temporal lobes would 

be involved if a short-term memory task required 

forming novel relations.
Evidence
Evidence supporting the unitary-store approach 

was reported by Hannula, Tranel, and Cohen 

(2006). They studied patients who had become 

amnesic as the result of an anoxic episode 

(involving de˚ cient oxygen supply). In one experi-

ment, scenes were presented for 20 seconds. 

Some scenes were repeated exactly, whereas others 

were repeated with one object having been 

moved spatially. Participants decided whether 

each scene had been seen previously. It was 

assumed that short-term memory was involved 
when a given scene was repeated in its original 

or slightly modi˚ ed form immediately after its 

initial presentation (Lag 1) but that long-term 

memory was involved at longer lags.
The ˚ ndings are shown in Figure 6.5. Amnesic 
patients performed much worse than healthy 

controls in short-term memory (Lag 1) and the 

performance difference between the two groups  

was even larger in long-term memory. The crucial 

issue is whether performance at Lag 1 was 
only
 
due to 
short-term memory. The ˚
 nding that  
amnesics™  
performance fell to chance level at 
longer lags suggests that they may well have 

relied almost exclusively on short-term memory 

at Lag 1. However, the ˚ nding that controls™ per-

formance changed little over lags suggests that 

they formed strong long-term relational memories, 

and these long-term memories may well account 

for their superior performance at Lag 1.
Further support for the unitary-store approach 
was reported by Hannula and Ranganath (2008). 

They presented four objec"

key ˚ nding was that the amount of activation 
in the anterior and posterior regions of the 

left hippocampus predicted relational memory 

performance.
Shrager, Levy, Hopkins, and Squire (2008) 
pointed out that a crucial issue is whether memory 

performance at short retention intervals actu-

ally depends on short-term memory rather than 

long-term memory. They argued that a distin-

guishing feature of short-term memory is that 

it involves active maintenance of informa-

tion throughout the retention interval. Tasks 

that mostly depend on short-term memory are 

vulnerable to distraction during the retention 

interval because distraction disrupts active main-

tenance. Shrager et al. divided their memory 

tasks into those susceptible to distraction in 

healthy controls and those that were not. Amnesic 

patients with medial temporal lobe lesions 

had essentially normal levels 
of performance 

on distraction-sensitive mem
ory tasks but were 
signi˚

Evaluation
The unitary-store approach has made memory 

researchers think deeply about the relationship 

between short-term and long-term memory. 

There are good reasons for accepting the notion 

that activation of part of long-term memory 

plays an important role in short-term memory. 

According to the unitary-store approach (but 

not the multi-store approach), amnesic patients 

can exhibit impaired short-term memory under 

some circumstances. Some recent evidence (e.g., 

Hannula et al., 2006) supports the prediction 

of the unitary-store approach. Functional neuro-

imaging evidence (e.g., Hannula & Ranganath, 

2008) also provides limited support for the 

unitary-store approach.
What are the limitations of the unitary-
store approach? First, it is oversimpli˚
 ed to 
argue that short-term memory is
 only
 activated 
by long-term memory. We can manipulate 

activated long-term memory in ˜
 exible ways 
and such manipulations go well beyond simply 

activating some fraction of long-term memory. 

Two examples of ways in which we can mani-

pulate information in short-term memory are 

backward digit recall (recalling digits in the 

opposite order to the presentation order) and 

generating novel visual images (Logie & van 

der Meulen, 2009). Second, there is no con-

vincing evidence that amnesic patients have 

impaired performance on relational memory 

tasks dependent primarily on short-term memory.  

It seems likely that amnesic patients only per-

form poorly on ﬁshort-term memoryﬂ tasks that 

depend to a large extent on long-term memory 

(Shrager et al., 2008). Third, there is no other 

evidence that decisively favours the unitary-store 

approach over the multiple-store approach. 

However, the search for such evidence only 

recently started in earnest.

The most important component is the
central executive. It has limited capacity

bles attention, and deals with any cognitively 

demanding task. The phonological loop and 

the visuo-spatial sketchpad are slave systems 

used by the central executive for speci˚
 c pur-
poses. The phonological loop preserves the order 

in which words are presented, and the visuo-

spatial sketchpad stores and manipulates spatial 

and visual information. All three components have 

limited capacity and are relatively independent 

of each other. Two assumptions follow:
If two tasks use the same component, they  
(1) 
cannot be performed successfully together.

If two tasks use different components, 
(2) 
it should be possible to perform them as 

well together as separately.

Phonological loop
Most early research on the phonological loop 

focused on the notion that verbal rehearsal 

(i.e., saying words over and over to oneself ) is of  

central importance. Two phenomena provid 
ing 
support for this view are the phonological 

similarity effect and the word-length effect. 

The 
phonological similarity effect
 is found 
when a short list of visually presented words 

is recalled immediately in the correct order. 

Recall perfor mance is worse when the words 

are phonologically similar (i.e., having similar 

sounds) than when they are phonologically dis-

similar. For example, FEE, HE, KNEE, LEE, ME, 

and SHE form a list of phonologically similar 

words, whereas BAY, HOE, IT, ODD, SHY, 

and UP form a list of phonologically dissimilar 

words. Larsen, Baddeley, and Andrade (2000) 

used those word lists, ˚ nding that recall of 

the words in order was 25% worse with the 

phonologically similar list. This phonological 

similarity effect occurred because participants 

used speech-based rehearsal processes within 

the phonological loop.
The 
word-length effect 
is based on memory 
span (the number of words or other items recalled 

immediately in the correct order). It is de˚
 ned 
by the ˚ nding that memory span is lower 

for words taking a long time to say than for

those taking less time. Baddeley, Thomson, and 
Buchanan (1975) found that participants recalled 

as many words presented visually as they could 

read out loud in 2 seconds. This suggested that 

the capacity of the phonological loop is deter-

mined by temporal duration like a tape loop. 

Service (2000) argued that these ˚
 ndings depend 
on phonological complexity rather than on 

temporal duration. Reassuringly, Mueller, Seymour, 

Kieras, and Meyer (2003) found with very care-

fully chosen words that memory span depended  

on the articulatory duration of words rather 

than their phonological complexity.
In another experiment, Baddeley et al. 
(1975) obtained more direct evidence that the 

word-length effect depends on the phonological 

loop. The number of visually presented words 

(out of ˚ ve) that could be recalled was assessed. 
Some participants were given the articulatory 

suppression task of repeating the digits 1 to 8 

while performing the main task. The argu 
ment 
was that the articulatory suppression task would 

involve the phonological loop and so prevent it  

being used on the word-span task. As predicted,  

articulatory suppression eliminated the word-

length effect (see Figure 6.8), suggesting it 

depends on the phonological loop.
As so often in psychology, reality is more 
complex than was originally thought. Note that 

the research discussed so far involved the
 visual
 
presentation of words. Baddeley et al. (1975) 

obtained the usual word-length effect when there 

was auditory presentation of word lists. Puzzlingly,

Baddeley (1986, 1990; see Figure 6.9) to argue that 
the phonological loop has two components:
A passive phonological store directly concerned
†
with speech perception.

An articulatory process linked to speech
†
production that gives access to the phono-

logical store.
According to this account, words presented
auditorily are processed differently from those 

presented visually. Auditory presentation of
 
words produces 
direct
 access to the phono-

logical store regardless of whether the articula-

tory control process is used. In contrast, visual 

presentation of words only permits 
indirect
 

access to the phonological store through sub-

vocal articulation.
The above account makes sense of many 
˚
 ndings. Suppose the word-length effect observed 
by Baddeley et al. (1975) depends on the rate 

of articulatory rehearsal (see Figure 6.8). Arti-

culatory suppression eliminates the word-length  

effect with visual presentation because access 

to the phonological store is prevented. However, 

it does 
not
 affect the word-length effect with 

auditory presentation because information about 

the words enters the phonological store directly.

brain areas associated with the two components 

of the phonological loop. Some brain-damaged  

patients have very poor memory for auditory-

verbal material but essentially normal speech 

production, indicating they have a damaged 

phonological store but an intact articulatory 

control process. These patients typically have 

damage to the left inferior parietal cortex ( 
Vallar 
& Papagno, 1995). Other brain-damaged patients 

have an intact phonological store but a damaged  

articulatory control process shown by a lack of 

evidence for rehearsal. Such patients 
generally  
have damage to the left inferior frontal 
cortex.
Similar brain areas have been identi˚
 ed 
in functional neuroimaging studies on healthy 

volunteers. Henson, Burgess, and Frith (2000) 

found that a left inferior parietal area was 

associated with the phonological store, whereas 

left prefrontal cortex was associated with rehearsal. 
Logie, Venneri, Della Sala, Redpath, and Marshall 

(2003) gave their participants the task of recall-

ing letter sequences presented auditorily in the 

correct order. All participants were instructed to 

use subvocal rehearsal to ensure the involvement 

of the rehearsal com
ponent of the phonological 

loop. The left inferior parietal gyrus and the inferior 

and middle frontal 
gyri were activated.
Evaluation
Baddeley™s theory accounts for the word-length 

effects and for the effects of articulatory suppres-

sion. In addition, evidence from brain-damaged 

patients and from functional neuroimaging 

studies with healthy participants indicates the 

existence of a phonological store and an articu-

latory control process located in different brain  

regions. Our understanding of the phonological 

loop is greater than that for the other com-

ponents of the working memory system.
What is the value of the phonological loop?  
According to Baddeley, Gathercole, and Papagno 

(1998, p. 158), ﬁThe function of"
Segment_377,"the phono-  logical loop is not to remember familiar words   but to learn new words.ﬂ Supporting evidence   was reported by Papagno, Valentine, and Baddeley   (1991). Native Italian speakers learned pairs   of Italian words and pairs of ItalianŒRussian   words. Articulatory suppression (which reduc",Explores how awareness influences cognition.,"awareness, recognition, perception",Nested under Chapter on recognition,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in emotion,Aligned with contemporary studies on memory,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_608," the phono-

logical loop is not to remember familiar words 

but to learn new words.ﬂ Supporting evidence 

was reported by Papagno, Valentine, and Baddeley 

(1991). Native Italian speakers learned pairs 

of Italian words and pairs of ItalianŒRussian 

words. Articulatory suppression (which reduces 

use of the phonological loop) greatly slowed 

the learning of foreign vocabulary but had little 

effect on the learning of pairs of Italian words.
Several studies have considered the relation-
ship between children™s vocabulary development 

and their performance on verbal short-term 

memory tasks involving the phonological loop. 

The capacity of the phonological loop generally  

predicts vocabulary size (e.g., Majerus, Poncelet, 

Elsen, & van der Linden, 2006). Such evidence 

is consistent with the notion that the phono-

logical loop plays a role in the learning of 

vocabulary. However, much of the evidence is 

correlational Œ it is also possible that having a 

large vocabulary increases 
the effective capacity 
of the phonological loop.
Trojano and Grossi (1995) studied SC, 
a patient with extremely poor phonological 

functioning. SC showed reasonable learning

ability in most situations but was unable to 
learn auditorily presented wordŒnonword pairs. 

Presumably SC™s poorly functioning phonological 

loop prevented the learning of the phonolo-

gically unfamiliar nonwords.
Visuo-spatial sketchpad
The visuo-spatial sketchpad is used for the 

temporary storage and manipulation of visual 

patterns and spatial movement. It is used in many 

situations in everyday life (e.g., ˚ nding the route  

when walking; playing computer games). Logie, 

Baddeley, Mane, Donchin, and Sheptak (1989) 

studied performance on a complex computer game 

called Space Fortress, which involves manoeuvr-

ing a space shi"

Early 

in training, performance on Space Fortress was 

severely impaired when participants had to per-

form a 
secondary visuo-spatial task. After 25 hours™ 
training, the adverse effects on the computer 

game of carrying out a visuo-spatial task at the 

same time were greatly reduced, being limited to  

those aspects directly involving perceptuo-motor 

control. Thus, the visuo-spatial sketchpad was 

used throughout training on Space Fortress, but 

its involvement decreased with practice.
The most important issue is whether 
there 
is a 
single
 system combining visual and spatial 

processing or whether there are partially or 

completely 
separate
 visual and spatial systems. 
According to Logie (1995; see Figure 6.10), 

the visuo-spatial sketchpad consists of two 

components:
Visual cache
† 
: This stores information about 
visual form and colour
.
Inner scribe
† 
: This processes spatial and 
movement information. It is involved in the  
rehearsal of information in the visual cache 

and transfers information from the visual 

cache to the central executive.
Recent developments in theory and research 

on the visuo-spatial sketchpad are discussed 

by Logie and van der Meulen (2009).
Klauer and Zhao (2004) explored the issue
 
of whether there are separate visual and spatial 

systems. They used two main tasks Œ a spatial 

task (memory for dot locations) and a visual 

task (memory for Chinese ideographs). There 

were also three secondary task conditions:
A movement discrimination task (spatial 
† 
interference).

A colour discrimination task (visual 
† 
interference).

A control condition (no secondary task).
† 
What would we expect if there are some-
what separate visual and spatial systems? First, 
the spatial interference task should disrupt
 
performance more on the spatial main task 

than on the visual main task. Second, the visual

Participants decided whether the probe was 
in the same location as one of the initial stimuli 

(spatial task) or had the same form (visual 

task). Even though the stimuli were identical 

in the two tasks, there were clear differences 

in patterns of brain activation. There was more 

activity in the right hemisphere during the spa-

tial task than the visual task, but more activity 

in the left hemisphere during the visual task 

than the spatial task.
Several other studies have indicated that 
different brain regions are activated during 

visual and spatial working-memory tasks (see 

Sala, Rämä, & Courtney, 2003, for a review). 

The ventral prefrontal cortex (e.g., the inferior 

and middle frontal gyri) is generally activated 

more during visual working-memory tasks than 

spatial ones. In contrast, more dorsal prefrontal 

cortex (especially an area of the superior 

prefrontal sulcus) tends to be more activated 

during spatial working-memory tasks than 

visual ones. This separation between visual"
Segment_380,and   spatial processing is consistent with evidence   that rather separate pathways are involved in   visual and spatial perceptual processing (see   Chapter 2). Evaluation Various kinds of evidence support the view that   the visuo-spatial sketchpad consists of some-  what separate visual (visual,Explores how emotion influences cognition.,"attention, recognition, emotion",Nested under Chapter on memory,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in perception,Aligned with contemporary studies on recognition,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_419," and 

spatial processing is consistent with evidence 

that rather separate pathways are involved in 

visual and spatial perceptual processing (see 

Chapter 2).
Evaluation
Various kinds of evidence support the view that 

the visuo-spatial sketchpad consists of some-

what separate visual (visual cache) and spatial 

(inner scribe) components. First, there is often 

little interference between visual and spatial 

tasks performed at the same time (e.g., Klauer 

& Zhao, 2004). Second, functional neuroimaging 

data suggest that the two components of the 

visuo-spatial sketchpad are located in different 

brain regions (e.g., Sala et al., 2003; Smith & 

Jonides, 1997). Third, some brain-damaged 

patients have damage to the visual component but 

not to the spatial component. For example, NL 

found it very hard to describe details from the 

left side of scenes in visual imagery even though 

his visual perceptual system was essentially intact 

(Beschin, Cocchini, Della Sala, & Logie, 1997).
Many tasks require both components of 
the visuo-spatial sketchpad to be used in com-

bination. It remains for the future to understand 

more fully how processing and information from 

the two components are combined and integrated 

on such tasks. In addition, much remains unknown 

about interactions between the workings of the 

visuo-spatial sketchpad and the episodic buffer 

(Baddeley, 2007).
Central executive
The central executive (which resembles an 

attentional system) is the most important and 

versatile component of the working memory 

system. Every time we engage in any complex 

cognitive activity (e.g., reading a text; solving 

a problem; carrying out two tasks at the same 

time), we make considerable use of the central 

executive. It is generally assumed that the pre-

frontal cortex is the part of the brain most 

involved in the functions of the central execu-

tive. Mottaghy (2006) reviewed studies using

careful about associating the central executive 
too directly with prefrontal cortex. As Andrés 

(2003) pointed out, patients with damage to 

prefrontal cortex do not always show executive  

de˚
cits, and some patients with no damage to 
prefrontal cortex nevertheless have executive 

de˚ cits.
One way of trying to understand the impor-
tance of the central executive in our everyday 

functioning is to study brain-damaged indi-

viduals whose central executive is impaired. Such 

individuals suffer from 
dysexecutive
 
syndrome
 
(Baddeley, 1996), which involves problems with 

planning, organising, monitoring behaviour, 

and initiating behaviour. Patients with dysexecu-

tive syndrome typically have damage within the 

frontal lobes at the front of the brain (adverse 

effects of damage to the prefrontal cortex on 

problem solving are discussed in Chapter 12). 

However, some patients seem to have damage to  

posterior (mainly parietal) rather than to frontal 

regions (e.g., Andrés, 2003). Brain-damaged 

patients are often tested with the Behavioural 

Assessment of the Dysexecutive Syndrome (BADS; 

Wilson, Alderman, Burgess, Emslie, & Evans, 
"
Segment_382,"1996). This consists of various tests assessing the   ability to shift rules, to devise and implement a    solution to a practical problem, to divide time   effectively among various tasks, and so on.

1996). This consists of various tests assessing the 

ability to shift rules, to devise and implement a  

solution to a practical problem, to divide time 

effectively among various tasks, and so on. 

Individuals with dysexecutive syndrome as assessed 

by the BADS typically have great problems in 

holding down a job and functioning adequately 

in everyday life (Chamberlain, 2003).
The conceptualisation of the central execu-
tive has changed over time. As Repovı and 

Baddeley (2006, p. 12) admitted, it was originally 

ﬁa convenient ragbag for unanswered ques-

tions related to the control of working memory 

and its two slave subsystems.ﬂ In the original 

model, the central executive was 
unitary
, mean-
ing that it functioned as a single unit. In recent 

years, theorists have increasingly argued that 

the central executive is more complex. Baddeley 

(1996) suggested that four of the functions of 

the central executive were as follows: switch-

ing of retrieval plans; timesharing in dual-task 

studies; selective attention to certain stimuli 

while ignoring others; and temporary activation  
of long-term memory. These are examples of 

executive processes
, which are processes that serve 

to organise and co-ordinate the functioning of 

the cognitive system to achieve current goals.
Miyake et al. (2000) identi˚
 ed three execu-
tive processes or functions overlapping partially 

with those of Baddeley (1996). They assumed 

these functions were related but separable:
Inhibition function
†
: This refers to ﬁone™s
ability to deliberately inhibit dominant,
automatic, or prepotent responses when

necessaryﬂ (p. 55). Friedman and Miyake

(2004) extended the inhibition function

to include resisting distractor interference.

For example, consider the 
Stroop task
, on
which participants have to name the colours

in which words are printed. In the most

dif˚
 cult condition, the words are con˜
 icting
colour words (e.g., the word BLUE printed

in red). In thi"
Segment_383,"s condition, performance is  slowed down and there are often many  errors. The inhibition function is needed to  minimise the distraction effect created by  the con˜ icting colour word.

errors. The inhibition function is needed to

minimise the distraction effect created by

the con˜ icting colour word. It is useful in

preventing us from thinking and behaving

in habitual ways when such ways are

inappropriate.

Shifting function
†
: This refers to ﬁshifting back
and forth between multiple tasks, opera-

tions, or mental setsﬂ (p. 55). It is used

when you switch attention from one task

to another. Suppose, for example, you are
presented with a series of trials, on each of

which two numbers are presented. In one
dysexecutive syndrome:
 a condition in which 
damage to the frontal lobes causes impairments 

to the 
central executive
 component of 

working memory
.

executive processes:
 processes that organise 

and co-ordinate the functioning of the cognitive 

system to achieve current goals.

Stroop task:
 a task in which the participant has 

to name the colours in which words are printed.

condition, there is task switching: on some 
trials you have to multiply the two numbers 

and on other trials you have to divide one 

by the other. In the other condition, there 

are long blocks of trials on which you 

always multiply the two numbers and there 

are other long blocks of trials on which you 

always divide one number by the other. 

Performance is slower in the task-switching 

condition, because attention has to be 

switched backwards and forwards between 

the two tasks. Task switching involves the 

shifting function, which allows us to shift 

attention rapidly from one task to another. 

This is a very useful ability in today™s 24 /7 

world.

Updating function
† 
: This refers to ﬁupdating 
and monitoring of working memory rep-

resentationsﬂ (p. 55). It is used when you 

update the information you need to "

required when participants are presented 

with members of various categories and have
 
to keep track of the most recently presented  

member of each category. Updating is useful 

if you are preparing a meal consisting of 

several dishes or, more generally, if you are 

trying to cope with changing circumstances.
Evidence
Various kinds of evidence support Miyake 

et al.™s (2000) identi˚ cation of three executive 

functions. First, there are the ˚
 ndings from 
their own research. They argued that most 

cognitive tasks involve various processes, which 

makes it dif˚ cult to obtain clear evidence for 

any single process. Miyake et al. administered 

several tasks to their participants and then used 

latent-variable analysis. This form of analysis 

focuses on positive correlations among tasks 

as the basis for identifying the common process 

or function involved. Thus, for example, three 

tasks might all involve a common process 

(e.g., the shifting function) but each task might 

also involve additional speci˚ c processes. Latent-

variable analysis provides a useful way of 

identifying the common process. Miyake et al. 
found evidence for three separable executive 

functions of inhibition, shifting, and monitor-

ing, but also discovered that these functions 

were positively correlated with each other.
Second, Collette et al. (2005) administered 
several tasks designed to assess the same three 

executive processes, and used positron emission 

tomography (PET; see Glossary) to compare 

brain activation associated with each process. 

There were two main ˚ ndings. First, each execu-

tive process or function was associated with 

activation in a different region within the pre-

frontal cortex. Second, all the tasks produced 

activation in the right intraparietal sulcus, the 

left superior parietal sulcus, and the left lateral 

prefrontal cortex. Collette et al. suggested that 

the right intra"
Segment_385,parietal sulcus is involved in   selective attention to relevant stimuli plus the   suppression of irrelevant information; the left   superior parietal sulcus is involved in switching   and integration processes; and the lateral pre-  frontal cortex is involved in monitoring and   temporal organisat,Explores how attention influences cognition.,"attention, perception, recognition",Nested under Chapter on emotion,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in perception,Aligned with contemporary studies on emotion,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_902,"parietal sulcus is involved in 

selective attention to relevant stimuli plus the 

suppression of irrelevant information; the left 

superior parietal sulcus is involved in switching 

and integration processes; and the lateral pre-

frontal cortex is involved in monitoring and 

temporal organisation.
Are there executive processes or functions 
not included within Miyake et al.™s (2000) 

theory? According to Baddeley (1996), one 

strong contender relates to the dual-task situ-

ation, in which people have to perform two 

different tasks at the same time. Executive pro-

cesses are often needed to co-ordinate process-

ing on the two tasks. Functional neuroimaging 

studies focusing on dual-task situations have 

produced somewhat variable findings (see 

Chapter 5). However, there is sometimes much 

activation in prefrontal areas (e.g., dorsolateral 

prefrontal cortex) when people perform two 

tasks at the same time but not when they per-

form only one of the tasks on its own (e.g., 

Collette et al., 2005; Johnson & Zatorre, 2006). 

Such ˚ ndings suggest that co-ordination of two 

tasks can involve an executive process based 

mainly in the prefrontal cortex.
Further support for the notion that there 
is an executive process involved speci˚
 cally in 
dual-task processing was reported by Logie, 

Cocchini, Della Sala, and Baddeley (2004).

Dysexecutive syndrome
Stuss and Alexander (2007) argued that the 

notion of a dysexecutive syndrome is ˜
 awed 
because it implies that brain damage to the 

frontal lobes typically damages 
all
 central 

executive functions of the central executive. 

They accepted that patients with widespread 

damage to the frontal lobes have a global dys-

executive syndrome. However, they claimed 

there are three executive processes based in 

different parts of the frontal lobes:
Task setting
† 
: This involves planning and 
was de˚ ned as ﬁthe ability to set a stimulusŒ
response 
relationship  .  .  .  necessary in the early 
stages of learning to drive a car or planning 

a weddingﬂ (p. 906).

Monitoring
† 
: This was de˚ ned as ﬁthe process
 
of checking the task over time for ‚quality 

control™ and the adjustment of behaviourﬂ 

(p. 909).

Energisation
† 
: This involves sustained atten-
tion or concentration and was de˚
 ned 
as 
ﬁthe process of initiation and sustaining of 

any 
response.  .  .  .  Without energisation  .  .  . 
maintaining performance over prolonged 

periods will waverﬂ (pp. 903Œ904).
All three executive processes are very general  
in that they are used across an enormous range 

of tasks. They are not really independent, 

because they are typically all used when you 

deal with a complex task. For example, if 

you have to give a speech in public, you would 
˚
 rst plan roughly what you are going to say 
(task setting), concentrate through the delivery 

of the speech (energisation), and check that 

what you are saying is what you intended 

(monitoring).
Stuss and Alexander (2007) tested their 
theory of executive functions on patients having 

fairly speci˚ c lesions within the frontal lobes.

Public speaking involves all three of Stuss and 
AlexanderÕs (2007) executive functions: planning 

what you are going to say (task setting); 

concentrating on delivery (energisation); and 

checking that what you say is as intended 

(monitoring).

221
Stuss and Alexander found evidence for 
the three hypothesised processes of energisa-
tion, task setting, and monitoring. They also 

discovered that each process was associated 

with a different region within the frontal cortex. 

Energisation involves the superior medial region  

of the frontal cortex, task setting involves the 

left lateral frontal region, and monitoring involves 

the right lateral frontal region. Thus, for example, 

patients with damage to the right lateral frontal 

region generally fail to detect the errors they 

make while performing a task and so do not 

adjust their performance.
Why do the processes identi˚ ed by Stuss 
and Alexander (2007) differ from those identi-

˚
 ed by Miyake et al. (2000)? The starting point 
in trying to answer that question is to remember 

that Stuss and Alexander based their conclu-

sions on studies with brain-damaged patients, 

whereas Miyake et al. studied only healthy 

individuals. Nearly all executive tasks involve 

common processes (e.g., energisation, task set-

ting, monitoring). These common processes are 

positively correlated in healthy individuals and 

so do not emerge clearly as separate processes. 

However, the differences among energisation, 

task setting, and monitoring become much 

clearer when we consider patients with very

of Stuss and Alexander and of Miyake et al. 

can be reconciled.
Evaluation
There has been real progress in understand-

ing the workings of the central executive. The 

central executive consists of various related but 

separable executive processes. There is accu-

mulating evidence that inhibition, updating, 

shifting, and dual-task co-ordination may be 

four major executive processes. It has become 

clear that the notion of a dysexecutive syndrome 

is misleading in that it suggests there is a 
single
 
pattern of impairment. Various executive pro-

cesses associated with different parts of frontal 

cortex are involved.
Two issues require more research. First, the  
executive processes suggested by behavioural 
and functional neuroimaging studies on healthy 

individuals do not correspond precisely with 

those suggested by studies on patients with 

damage to the frontal cortex. We have specu-

lated on the reasons for this, but solid evidence 

is needed. Second, while we have emphasised 

the differences among the major 
executive pro-

cesses or functions, there is plentiful 
evidence 
suggesting that these processes are fairly closely  

related to each other. The reasons for this 

remain somewhat unclear.
Episodic buffer
Baddeley (2000) added a fourth component 

to the working memory model. This is the 

episodic buffer
, in which information from 

various sources (the phonological loop, the visuo-

spatial sketchpad, and long-term memory) can 

be integrated and stored brie˜ y. According to 

Repovı and Baddeley (2006, p. 15), the epi-

sodic buffer, ﬁis episodic by virtue of holding 

information that is integrated from a range of 

systems including other working memory com-

ponents and long-term memory into coherent 

complex structures: scenes or episodes. It is a 

buffer in that it serves as an intermediary between 

subsystems with different code"

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
Why did Baddeley add the episodic buffer 
to the working memory model? The original 
version of the model was limited because its 

various components were too separate in their 

functioning. For example, Chincotta, Underwood, 

Abd Ghani, Papadopoulou, and Wresinki (1999) 

studied memory span for Arabic numerals and 

digit words, ˚ nding that participants used both 

verbal and visual encoding while performing 

the task. This suggests that participants com-

bined information from the phonological loop 

and
 the visuo-spatial sketchpad. Since these 

two stores are separate, this combination and 

integration process must take place elsewhere, 

and the episodic buffer ˚ ts the bill.
Another ˚ nding hard to explain within 
the original working memory model is that, in 

immediate recall, people can recall about ˚
 ve 
unrelated words but up to 16 words presented 

in sentences (Baddeley, Vallar, & Wilson, 1987). 

The notion of an episodic buffer is useful, 

because this is where information from long-

term memory could be integrated with infor-

mation from the phonological loop and the 

visuo-spatial sketchpad.

Their participants had to recall a mixture of 

digits and visual locations, a task assumed to 

require the episodic buffer. As predicted, there 

was greater right prefrontal activation in this 

condition than one in which digits and visual 

locations were not mixed during presentation.
Baddeley and Wilson (2002) provided sup-
port for the notion of an episodic buffer. They 

pointed out that it had generally been assumed 

that good immediate prose recall involves the 

ability to store some of the relevant information 

in long-term memory. According to this view, 

amnesic patients with very impaired long-term 

memory should have very poor immediate prose  

recall. In contrast, Baddeley and Wilson 
argued 
that the ability to exhibit good immediate 
prose 
recall depends on two factors: (1) the capacity 

of the episodic buffer; and (2) an ef˚
 ciently 
f unctioning central executive creating and main-

taining 
information in the buffer. 
According to 
this argument, even severely amnesic patients with 

practically no delayed recall of prose should have 

good immediate prose recall provided they have 

an ef˚ cient central executive. As predicted, 
imme-

diate prose recall was much better in amnesics 

having little de˚ cit in executive functioning than 

in those with a severe executive de˚
 cit.
Other studies suggest that the episodic buffer 
can operate independently of the central execu-

tive. Gooding, Isaac, and Mayes (2005) failed 

to replicate Baddeley and Wilson™s (2002) ˚
 nd-
ings in a similar study. Among their amnesic 

patients (who were less intelligent than those 

studied by Baddeley and Wilson), there was a 

non-signi˚
 cant correlation between immediate 
prose recall and measures of executive function-

ing. It is possible that using the central executive

disease that 60% of those having almost intact 

performance on tasks requiring the central 

executive nevertheless had no immediate prose 

recall. This ˚ nding also casts doubt on the 

importance of the central executive on tasks 

involving the episodic buffer.
Rudner, Fransson, Ingvar, Nyberg, and 
Ronnberg (2007) used a task involving combin-

ing representations based on sign language and 

on speech. This episodic buffer task was not 

associated with prefrontal activation, but was 

associated with activation in the left hippocam-

pus. This is potentially important because the 

hippocampus plays a key role in 
binding together 

different kinds of informa 
tion in memory (see 
Chapter 7). An association between use of the 

episodic buffer and the hippocampus was also 

reported by Berlingeri et al. (2008). They found 

among patients with 
Alzheimer™s disease that  

those with most atrophy o f  
the anterior part of 
the hippocampus did worst on immediate prose 

recall.

original three components of the model were 
too separate from each other and from long-

term 
memory to account for our ability to 
combine different kinds of information (e.g., 

visual, verbal) on short-term memory tasks. 

The episodic buffer helps to provide the 

ﬁglueﬂ to integrate information within working 

memory.
Some progress has been made in tracking 
down the brain areas associated with the 

episodic buffer. The hippocampus is of central 

importance in binding and integrating informa-

tion during learning, and so it is unsurprising 

that it is associated with use of the episodic

It is harder to carry out research on the 
episodic buffer than on the phonological loop 

or the visuo-spatial sketchpad. We have to use 

complex tasks to study the episodic buffer because 

it involves the complicated integration of infor-

mation. In contrast, it is 
possible to devise rela-

tively simple 
tasks to study the phonological loop  
or the visuo-spatial sketchpad. In 
addition, there 

are often close connections between the episodic 

buffer and the other components of the working 

memory system. That often makes it dif˚
 cult 
to distinguish clearly between the episodic buffer 

and the other components.
Overall evaluation
The working memory model has several advant-

ages over the short-term memory store proposed 

by Atkinson and Shiffrin (1968). First, the work-

ing memory system is concerned with both active 

processing and transient storage of informa-

tion, and so is involved in all complex cognitive 

tasks, such as language comprehension (see 

Chapter 10) and reasoning (see Chapter 14).
Second, the working memory model explains 
the partial de˚ cits of short-term memory observed 

in brain-damaged patients. If brain damage 

affects only one of the three components of work-

ing memory, then selective de˚ cits on short-term 

memory tasks would be expected.
Third, the working memory model incor-
porates verbal rehearsal as an optional process 

within the phonological loop. This is more 

realistic than the enormous signi˚
 cance of 
rehearsal within the multi-store model of 

Atkinson and Shiffrin (1968).
What are the limitations of the working 
memory model? First, it has proved dif˚
 cult 
to identify the number and nature of the main 

executive processes associated with the central 

executive. For example, disagreements on the 

nature of execu"

approaches based on latent-variable analyses 

of executive tasks (Miyake et al., 2000) and 

on data from brain-damaged patients (Stuss & 

Alexander, 2007). One reason for the lack of 

clarity is that most complex tasks involve the 

use of more than one executive process, making 

it hard to establish the contribution that each 

has made.
Second, we need more research on the 
relationship between the episodic buffer and 

the other components of the working memory 

system. As yet, we lack a detailed account of 

how the episodic buffer integrates information 

from the other components and from long-term 

memory.
LEVELS OF PROCESSING
What determines how well we remember informa-

tion over the long term? According to Craik 

and Lockhart (1972), what is crucial is how 

we process that information during learning. 

They argued in their levels-of-processing approach 

that attentional and perceptual processes at 

learning determine what information is stored 

in long-term memory. There are various levels 

of processing, ranging from shallow or physical 

analysis of a stimulus (e.g., detecting speci˚
 c 
letters in words) to deep or semantic analysis; 

the greater the extent to which meaning is 

processed, the deeper the level of processing. 

They implied that processing nearly always 

proceeds in a serial fashion from shallow 

sensory levels to deeper semantic ones. However, 

they subsequently (Lockhart & Craik, 1990)

In fact, however, maintenance rehearsal typi-

on long-term mem 
ory (Glenberg, Smith, & 
Green, 1977).
Evidence
Numerous studies support the main assump-

tions of the levels-of-processing approach. For 

example, Craik and Tulving (1975) compared 

recognition performance as a function of the 

task performed at learning:
Shallow graphemic task
†
: decide whether each
word is in uppercase or lowercase letters.

Intermediate phonemic task
†
: decide whether
each word rhymes with a target word.

Deep semantic task
†
: decide whether each
word ˚ ts a sentence containing a blank.
Depth of processing had impressive effects on 

memory performance, with performance more 

than three times higher with deep than with 

shallow processing. In addition, performance 

was generally much better for words associated 
with ﬁY
esﬂ responses on the processing task 
than those associated with ﬁNoﬂ responses. 

Craik and Tulving used incidental learning Œ 

the participants did not realise at the time of 

learning that there would be a memory test. 

They argued that the nature of task processing 
rather than the intention to learn is crucial.
Craik and Tulving (1975) assumed that the 
semantic task involved deep processing and 

the uppercase/lowercase task involved shallow 

processing. However, it would be preferable to 

assess depth. One approach is to use brain-

imaging to identify the brain regions involved 

in different kinds of processing. For example, 

Wagner, Maril, Bjork, and Schacter (2001) found 

there was more activation in the left inferior

temporal lobe d"

somewhat inconsistent. Park and Rugg (2008b) 

presented word pairs and asked participants to 

rate the extent to which they shared a semantic 

theme (deep processing) or sounded similar 

(shallow processing). Memory was better follow-

ing 
semantic processing than phonological pro-
cessing. However, successful memory performance 

was associated with activa tion in the left ventrol-

ateral prefrontal cortex regardless of the encoding  

t ask. This ˚ nding suggests that there is no simple 

relationship between processing task and patterns 

of brain activation.
Craik and Tulving (1975) argued that elabora-
tion of processing (i.e., the amount of processing 

of a particular kind) is important as well as depth  

of processing. Participants were presented on 

each trial with a word and a sentence containing 

a blank, and decided whether the word ˚
 tted 
into the blank space. Elaboration was mani-

pulated by using simple (e.g., ﬁShe cooked the 

____ﬂ) and complex ﬁThe great bird swooped 

down and carried off the struggling ____ﬂ) 

sentence frames. Cued recall was twice as high 

for words accompanying complex sentences.

Eysenck (1979) argued that distinctive or 
unique memory traces are easier to retrieve than 

those resembling other memory traces. Eysenck 

and Eysenck (1980) tested this notion using 

nouns having irregular graphemeŒphoneme 

correspondence (i.e., words not pronounced 

in line with pronunciation rules, such as ﬁcombﬂ 

with its silent ﬁbﬂ). In one condition, parti-

cipants pronounced these nouns as if they 

had regular graphemeŒphoneme correspond-

ence, thus producing distinctive memory traces. 

Other nouns were simply pronounced normally, 

thus producing non-distinctive memory traces. 

Recognition memory was much better in the 

former condition, indicating the importance of 

distinctiveness.
Morris, Bransford, and Franks (1977) 
argued that stored information is remembered 

only if it is of
 relevance 
to the memory test. 

Participants answered semantic or shallow 

(rhyme) questions for lists of words. Memory 

was tested by a standard recognition test, in 
which list and non-list words were presented, 

or by a rhyming recognition test. On this latter 

test, participants selected words that rhymed 

with list words: the words themselves were 
not
 
presented. With the standard recognition test, 

the predicted superiority of deep over shallow 

processing was obtained (see Figure 6.12). How-

ever, the 
opposite
 result was reported with the 

rhyme test, which disproves the notion that deep 

processing always enhances long-term memory.
Morris et al. (1977) argued that their ˚
 nd-
ings supported transfer-appropriate processing 

theory. According to this theory, different kinds 

of learning lead learners to acquire different 

kinds of information about a stimulus. Whether 

the stored information leads to subsequent 

retention depends on the 
relevance
 of that 

information to the memory test. For example, 

storing semantic information is essentially 

irrelevant when the memory test requires the

to consider the effects of level of processing 
on implicit memory (memory not involving 

conscious recollection; see Chapter 7). Challis, 

Velichkovsky, and Craik (1996) asked parti-

cipants to learn word lists under various condi-

tions: judging whether the word was related to 

them (self-judgement); simple intentional learning; 

judging whether it referred to a living thing 

(living judgement); counting the number of 

syllables (syllable task); or counting the number 

of letters of a certain type (letter type). The 

order of these tasks re˜ ects decreasing depth 

of processing. There were four explicit memory 

tests (recognition, free recall, semantic cued 

recall involving a word related in meaning to 
a list word, and graphemic cued recall involving 

a word with similar spelling to a list word), and 

two implicit memory tests. One of these tests 

involved answering general knowledge ques-

tions in which the answers corresponded to 

list words, and the other involved completing 

word fragments (e.g., c _ pp _ _).

effect on the general knowledge memory 
test. The general knowledge memory test is a 

conceptual implicit memory test based on mean-

ing. As a result, it seems reasonable that it would 

be affected by level of processing, even though 

the effects were much smaller than with explicit 

memory tests. In contrast, the word-fragment test 

is a perceptual implicit memory test not based on  

meaning, which helps to explain why there was 

no levels-of-processing effect with this test.
In sum, levels-of-processing effects were gen-
erally greater in explicit memory than implicit 

memory. In addition, there is some support for 

the predictions of levels-of-processing theory 

with all memory tests other than the word-

fragment test. Overall, the ˚
 ndings are too 
complex to be explained readily by levels-of-

processing theory.

may sound obvious, but surprisingly little 

research before 1972 focused on learning pro-

cesses and their effects on memory. Another 

strength is the central assumption that percep-

tion, attention, and memory are all closely 

interconnected, and that learning and remem-

bering are by-products of perception, attention, 

and comprehension. In addition, the approach 

led to the identi˚
 cation of elaboration and dis-
tinctiveness of processing as important factors 

in learning and memory.
The levels-of-processing approach pos-
sesses several limitations. First, it is generally 

dif˚
 cult to assess processing depth. Second, 
Craik and Lockhart (1972) greatly under-

estimated the importance of the retrieval environ-

ment in determining memory performance. 

As Morris et al. (1977) showed, the typical 

levels effect can be reversed if stored semantic 

information is irrelevant to the requirements 

of the memory test. Third, long-term memory 

is in˜ uenced by depth of processing, elabora-

tion of processing, and distinctiveness of pro-

cessing. However, the relative importance of 
these factors (and how they are inter-related) 

remains unclear. Fourth, ˚ ndings from amnesic 

patients (see Chapter 7) cannot be explained 

by the levels-of-processing approach. Most 

amnesic patients have good semantic or deep 

processing skills, but their long-term memory 

is extremely poor, probably because they have 

major problems with consolidation (˚
 xing of 
newly learned information in long-term memory) 

(Craik, 2002; see Chapter 7). Fifth, Craik and 

Lockhart (1972) did not explain precisely 
why
 
deep processing is so effective, and it is not clear 

why there is a much smaller levels-of-processing 

effect in implicit than in explicit memory.

is dif˚ cult to express.ﬂ You probably possess 
skills that are hard to express in words. For 

example, it is notoriously dif˚
 cult to express 
what we know about riding a bicycle.
There are clear similarities between implicit 
learning and implicit memory, which is memory  

not depending on conscious recollection (see 

Chapter 7). You may wonder why implicit learn-

ing and implicit memory are not discussed 

together. There 
are three reasons. First, there 
are some differences between implicit learning 

and implicit memory. As Buchner and Wippich 

(1998) pointed out, implicit learning refers to 

ﬁthe [incidental] acquisition of knowledge about 

the structural properties of the relations between 

[usually more than two] objects or events.ﬂ In 

contrast, implicit memory refers to ﬁsi"
Segment_401,"tuations in    which effects of prior experiences can be observed   despite the fact that the participants are not   instructed to relate their current performance to    a learning episodeﬂ (Buchner & Wippich, 1998).    Second, studies of implicit learning have typically   used relatively complex, n",Explores how emotion influences cognition.,"attention, memory, recognition",Nested under Chapter on memory,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in emotion,Aligned with contemporary studies on memory,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_744,"tuations in  

which effects of prior experiences can be observed 

despite the fact that the participants are not 

instructed to relate their current performance to  

a learning episodeﬂ (Buchner & Wippich, 1998).  

Second, studies of implicit learning have typically 

used relatively complex, novel stimulus materials, 

whereas most studies of implicit memory have 

used simple, familiar stimulus materials. Third, 

relatively few researchers have considered the 

relations between implicit learning and implicit 

memory.
How do the systems involved in implicit 
learning differ from those involved in explicit 
learning and memory? Reber (1993) proposed 

˚
 ve such characteristics (none has been estab-
lished de˚
 nitively):
Robustness
†
: Implicit systems are relatively
unaffected by disorders (e.g., amnesia) affect-

ing explicit systems.

Age independence
†
: Implicit learning is
little in˜ uenced by age or developmental
level.

Low variability
†
: There are smaller individual
differences in implicit learning and memory

than in explicit learning and memory
.
IQ independence
†
: Performance on implicit
tasks is relatively unaffected by IQ.

Commonality of process
†
: Implicit systems
are common to most species.
W
e can identify three main types of research
on implicit learning. First, there are studies to 

see whether healthy participants can learn fairly 
complex material in the absence of conscious 

awareness of what they have learned. According
 
to Reber (1993), individual differences in such 

learning should depend relatively little on IQ. 

It is often assumed that implicit learning makes 

minimal demands on attentional resources. If 

so, the requirement to perform an additional 

attentionally-demanding task at the same time 

should not impair implicit learning.
Second, there are brain-imaging studies. If 
implicit learning depends on different cognitive 

processes to explicit learning, the brain areas 

associated with implicit learning should"
Segment_402,"differ   from those associated with explicit learning.   More speci˚ cally, brain areas associated with   conscious experience and attentional control   (e.g., parts of the prefrontal cortex) should be   much less activated during implicit learning   than explicit learning. Third, there are studies",Explores how emotion influences cognition.,"emotion, attention, recognition",Nested under Chapter on recognition,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in attention,Aligned with contemporary studies on recognition,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_160," differ 

from those associated with explicit learning. 

More speci˚ cally, brain areas associated with 

conscious experience and attentional control 

(e.g., parts of the prefrontal cortex) should be 

much less activated during implicit learning 

than explicit learning.
Third, there are studies on brain-damaged 
patients, mostly involving amnesic patients 

having severe problems with long-term memory. 

Amnesic patients typically have relatively intact 

implicit memory even though their explicit 

memory is greatly impaired (see Chapter 7). If 

amnesic patients have intact implicit learning but 

impaired explicit learning, this would provide 
Implicit learning is Òlearning without conscious 
awareness of having learnedÓ. Bike riding is an 

example of implicit learning in which there is no 

clear conscious awareness of what has been 

learned.

evidence that the two types of learning are very 
different.
You might imagine it would be relatively 
easy to decide whether implicit learning has 

occurred Œ we simply ask participants to perform 

a complex task without instructing them to 

engage in deliberate learning. Afterwards, they 

indicate their conscious awareness of what 

they have learned. Implicit learning has been 

demonstrated if learning occurs in the absence 

of conscious awareness of the nature of that 

learning. Alas, there are several reasons why 

participants fail to report conscious aware-

ness of what they have learned. For example, 

there is the ﬁretrospective problemﬂ (Shanks &  

St. John, 1994): participants may be consciously 

aware of what they are learning at the time, 

but have forgotten it when questioned at the 

end of the experiment. Shanks and St. John 

proposed two criteria for implicit learning to 

be demonstrated:

People may be consciously aware of more

underestimate their consciously accessible 

knowledge.
Complex learning
Much early research on implicit learning involved 

arti˚
 cial grammar learning. On this task, parti-
cipants initially memorise meaningless letter 

strings (e.g., PVPXVPS; TSXXTVV). After that, 

they are told that the memorised letter strings 

all follow the rules of an arti˚
 cial grammar, 
but are not told the nature of these rules. Next, 

the participants classify 
novel
 strings as gram-

matical or ungrammatical. Finally, they describe 

the rules of the arti˚
 cial grammar. Participants 
typically perform signi˚ cantly above chance level 
on the classi˚ cation task, but cannot describe 

the grammatical rules (e.g., Reber, 1967). Such 

˚
 ndings are less impressive than they appear. As  
several researchers have found (e.g., Channon, 

Shanks, Johnstone, Vakili, Chin, & Sinclair, 2002), 

participants™ decisions on the grammaticality 

of letter strings do 
not 
depend on knowledge 
of grammatical rules. Instead, participants clas-

sify letter strings as grammatical when they 

share letter pairs with the letter strings memo-

rised initially and as ungrammatical when they 

do not. Thus, above-chance performance depends 

on conscious awareness of two-letter fragments, 

and provides little or no evidence of implicit 

learning.
The most commonly used implicit learning 
task involves serial reaction time. On each trial, 

a stimulus appears at one out of several locations 

on a computer screen, and participants respond  

rapidly with the response key corresponding to 

its location. Th"
Segment_404,"ere is typically a complex, repeat-  ing  sequence over trials in the various stimulus   locations, but participants are not told this.

sequence over trials in the various stimulus  
locations, but participants are not told this. Towards 

the end of the experiment, there is typically a 

block of trials conforming to a novel sequence, 

but this information is not given to participants. 

Participants speed up during the course of the 

experiment but respond much slower during the 

novel sequence (see Shanks, 2005, for a review). 

When questioned at the end of the experiment, 

participants usually show no conscious awareness 

that there was a repeating sequence or pattern 

in the stimuli presented to them.
One strength of the serial reaction time task 
is that the repeating sequence (which is crucial 

to the demonstration of implicit learning) is 

incidental to the explicit task of responding to 

the stimuli as rapidly as possible. However, we 

need to satisfy the information and sensitivity 

criteria (described above) with this task. It seems 

reasonable to make the awareness test very 

similar to the learning task, as was done by 

Howard and Howard (1992). An asterisk 

appeared in one of four locations on a screen, 

under each of which was a key. The task was 

to press the key corresponding to the position 

of the asterisk as rapidly as possible. Participants 

showed clear evidence of learning the underlying

test of predicting where the asterisk would 

appear next, their performance was at chance

reported by Wilki"
Segment_405,"nson and Shanks (2004).   Participants were given either 1500 trials (15   blocks) or 4500 trials (45 blocks) on the task   and showed strong evidence of sequence learn-  ing. Then they were told there was a repeated   sequence in the stimuli, following which they   were presented on each of 12 tria",Explores how perception influences cognition.,"emotion, awareness, attention",Nested under Chapter on emotion,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in perception,Aligned with contemporary studies on awareness,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_1342,"nson and Shanks (2004). 

Participants were given either 1500 trials (15 

blocks) or 4500 trials (45 blocks) on the task 

and showed strong evidence of sequence learn-

ing. Then they were told there was a repeated 

sequence in the stimuli, following which they 

were presented on each of 12 trials with part 

of the sequence under one of two conditions. 

In the
 inclusion 
condition, they guessed the 

next location in the sequence. In the 
exclusion
 

condition, they were told they should avoid 

guessing the next location in the sequence. 

If sequence knowledge is wholly implicit, then 

performance should not differ between the 

inclusion and exclusion conditions because 

participants would be unable to control how 

they used their sequence knowledge. In con-

trast, if it is partly explicit, then participants 

should be able to exert intentional control over 

their sequence knowledge. If so, the guesses 

generated in the inclusion condition should be 

more likely to conform to the repeated sequence  

than those in the exclusion condition. The ˚
 nd-
ings indicated that explicit knowledge was 

acquired on the serial reaction time task (see 

Figure 6.14).
Similar ˚ ndings were reported by Destrebecqz 
et al. (2005) in another study using the serial 

reaction time task. The interval of time between 

the participant™s response to one stimulus and 

the presentation of the next one was either 0 ms  

or 250 ms, it being assumed that explicit learning  

would be more likely with the longer interval. 

Participants responded progressively faster over 

trials with both response-to-stimulus intervals. 

As Wilkinson and Shanks (2004) had done, 

they used inclusion and exclusion conditions. 

Participants™ responses were signi˚
 cantly closer 
to the training sequence in the inclusion condi-

tion than in the exclusion condition, suggesting 

that some explicit learning occurred, especially 

when the response-to-stimulus interval was long. 

In addi"
Segment_406,"tion, as discussed below, brain-imaging   ˚  ndings from this study suggested that explicit  learning occurred. If the serial reaction time task genuinely  involves implicit learning, performance on that   task might well be unaffected by the requirement   to perform a second, attentionally-demandin",Explores how awareness influences cognition.,"attention, recognition, memory",Nested under Chapter on emotion,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in perception,Aligned with contemporary studies on memory,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_1208,"tion, as discussed below, brain-imaging 

˚
 ndings from this study suggested that explicit 
learning occurred.
If the serial reaction time task genuinely 
involves implicit learning, performance on that 

task might well be unaffected by the requirement 

to perform a second, attentionally-demanding 

task at the same time. This prediction was tested 

by Shanks, Rowland, and Ranger (2005). Four 

different target stimuli were presented across 

trials, and the main task was to respond rapidly 

to the location at which a target was presented. 

Half the participants performed only this 

task, and the remainder also carried out 

the attentionally-demanding task of counting 

targets. Participants with the additional task per-

formed much more slowly than those with no 

additional task, and also showed signi˚
 cantly 
inferior sequence learning. Thus, attentional 

resources were needed for effective learning of 

the sequence on the serial reaction time task, 

which casts doubt on the notion that such 

learning is implicit. In addition, both groups

of participants had signi˚

explicit learning.

that individual differences in intelligence have

learning. Gebauer and Mackintosh (2007) carried 

out a thorough study using various implicit 

learning tasks (e.g., arti˚ cial grammar learning; 

serial reaction time). These tasks were given 

under standard implicit instructions or with 

explicit rule discovery instructions (i.e., indicating 

explicitly that there were rules to be discovered) . 

The mean correlation between implicit task 

performance and intelligence was only 
+
0.03, 

whereas it was 
+
0.16 between explicit task 

performance and intelligence. This supports 

the hypothesis. It is especially important that 

intelligence (which is positively associated with 

performance on the great majority of cogni-

tive tasks) failed to predict implicit learning 

performance.
Brain-imaging studies
Different areas of the brain should be activated 

during implicit and explicit learning if they 

are genuinely different. Conscious awareness 

is associated with activation in many brain 

regions, but the main ones are the anterior 

cingulate and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex 

(Dehaene & Naccache, 2001; see Chapter 16). 

Accordingly, these areas should be more active 

during explicit than implicit learning. In contrast,  

it has often been assumed that the striatum is 

associated with implicit learning (Destrebecqz 

et al., 2005). The 
striatum
 is part of the basal 

ganglia; it is located in the interior areas of the 

cerebral hemispheres and the upper region of 

the brainstem.
Functional neuroimaging studies have pro-
vided limited support for the above predictions. 

Grafton, Hazeltine, and Ivry (1995) found that 

explicit learning was associated with activation 

in the anterior cingulate, regions in the parietal 

cortex involved in working memory, and areas 

in the parietal cortex concerned with voluntary 
attention. Aizenstein et al. (2004) found that 

there was greater activation in the prefrontal 

cortex and anterior cingulate during explicit 

rather than implicit l"
Segment_408,"earning. However, they   did not ˚ nd any clear evidence that the striatum   was more activated during implicit than explicit    learning. Destrebecqz et al. (2005) pointed out that  most so-called explicit or implicit learning   tasks probably involve a mixture of explicit   and implicit learning.",Explores how perception influences cognition.,"perception, awareness, recognition",Nested under Chapter on emotion,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in recognition,Aligned with contemporary studies on emotion,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_934,"earning. However, they 

did not ˚ nd any clear evidence that the striatum 

was more activated during implicit than explicit  

learning.
Destrebecqz et al. (2005) pointed out that 
most so-called explicit or implicit learning 

tasks probably involve a mixture of explicit 

and implicit learning. As mentioned before, 

they used inclusion and exclusion conditions 

with the serial reaction time task to distinguish 

clearly between the explicit and implicit com-

ponents of learning. Activation in the striatum 

was associated with the implicit component 

of learning, and the mesial prefrontal cortex 

and anterior cingulate were associated with the 

explicit component.
In sum, failure to discover clear differences 
in patterns of brain activation between explicit 

and implicit learning can occur because the 

tasks used are not pure measures of these two 

forms of learning. It is no coincidence that 

the study distinguishing most clearly between 

explicit and implicit learning (Destrebecqz et al., 

2005) is also the one producing the greatest 

support for the hypothesised associations of 

prefrontal cortex with explicit learning and the 

striatum with implicit learning.
Brain-damaged patients
As discussed in Chapter 7, amnesic patients 

typically perform very poorly on tests of explicit 

memory (involving conscious recollection) but 

often perform as well as healthy individuals 

on tests of implicit memory (on which conscious 

recollection is not needed). The notion that 

separate learning systems underlie implicit learn-

ing and explicit learning would be supported 
striatum:
 it forms part of the basal ganglia of 
the brain and is located in the upper part of the 

brainstem and the inferior part of the cerebral 

hemispheres.

severely impaired, but amnesics™ performance 

on tasks allegedly involving implicit learning 

is variable (see Vandenberghe, Schmidt, Fery, &  

Cleeremans, 2006, for a 
review). For example,  
Knowlton, Ramus, and Squi
re (1992) found that 
amnesics performed as well as healthy controls 

on an implicit test on which participants dis-

tinguished between grammatical and ungram-

matical letter strings (63%v
ersus 67% correct, 
respectively). However,  
they performed signi˚
 -
cantly worse than the controls on an explicit test 

(62% versus 72%, respectively).
Meulemans and Van der Linden (2003) 
pointed out that amnesics™ performance on 

Knowlton et al.™s (1992) implicit test may have 

depended on explicit fragment knowledge (e.g., 

pairs of letters found together). Accordingly, they 

used an arti˚ cial grammar learning task in which 

fragment knowledge could not in˜
 uence perfor-
mance on the test of implicit learning. They also 

used a test of explicit learning in which partici-

pants wrote down ten letter strings they regarded 

as grammatical. The amnesic patients performed 

as well as the healthy controls on implicit learning. 

However, their performance was much worse 

than that of the controls on explicit learning.
There is evidence of implicit learning in 
amnesic patients in studies on the serial reac-

tion time task. The most thorough such study 

was carried out by Vandenberghe et al. (2006). 

Amnesic patients and healthy controls were 

given two versions of the task: (1) deterministic 

sequence (˚ xed repeating sequence); and (2) 

probabilistic sequence (repeating sequence with 

some deviations). The healthy controls showed 

clear evidence of learning with both sequences. 

The use of inclusion and exclusion instructions 

indicated that healthy controls showed explicit 

learning with the deterministic sequence but 

not with the probabilist"
Segment_410,"ic one. The amnesic   patients showed limited learning of the deter-  ministic sequence but not of the probabilistic   sequence. Their performance was comparable   with inclusion and exclusion instructions, indicat-  ing that this learning was implicit. Earlier we discussed the hypothesis that the",Explores how awareness influences cognition.,"awareness, recognition, memory",Nested under Chapter on memory,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in memory,Aligned with contemporary studies on emotion,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_1026,"ic one. The amnesic 

patients showed limited learning of the deter-

ministic sequence but not of the probabilistic 

sequence. Their performance was comparable 

with inclusion and exclusion instructions, indicat-

ing that this learning was implicit.
Earlier we discussed the hypothesis that the 
striatum is of major importance in implicit 

learning. Patients with Parkinson™s disease (the 

symptoms of which include limb tremor and 

muscle rigidity) have damage to the striatum, 

and so we could predict that they would have 

impaired implicit learning. The evidence generally  

supports that prediction (see Chapter 7 for a 

fuller discussion). Siegert, Taylor, Weatherall, and 

Abernethy (2006) carried out a meta-analysis 

of six studies investigating the performance of 

patients with Parkinson™s disease on the serial 

reaction time task. Skill learning on this task  

was consistently impaired in the patients relative 

to healthy controls. Wilkinson and Jahanshahi 

(2007) obtained similar ˚ ndings with patients 

having Parkinson™s disease using a different version 

of the serial reaction time task. In addition, they 

reported convincing evidence that patients™ learn-

i ng was implicit (i.e., lacked conscious awareness). 

The patients performed at chance level when 

trying to recognise old sequences. In addition, 

their knowledge was not under intentional 

control, as was shown by their inability to sup-

press the expression of what they had learned 

when instructed to do so.
We have seen that there is some evidence 
that amnesic patients have poor explicit learn-

ing combined with reasonably intact implicit 

learning. We would have evidence of a double 

dissociation (see Glossary) if patients with 

Parkinson™s disease had poor implicit learning 

combined with intact explicit learning. This 

pattern has occasionally been reported with 

patients in the early stages of the disease (e.g.,

studies on healthy participants; and studies on 
amnesic patients. Much of that research suggests 

that implicit learning should be distinguished 

from explicit learning. Some of the most convin-

cing evidence has come from studies on brain-

damaged patients. For example, Vanderberghe 

et al. (2006) found, using the serial reaction time 

task, that amnesic patients™ learning seemed to be  

almost entirely at the implicit level. Other con-

vincing evidence has come from functional neuro-

imaging studies. There is accumulating 
evidence  

that explicit learning is associated with the pre-

frontal cortex and the anterior 
cingulate, whereas 

implicit learning is associated 
with the striatum.
What are the limitations of research on implicit 
learning? First, it has proved hard to devise tests 

of awareness that can detect 
all
 the task-relevant 

knowledge of which people have conscious aware-

ness. Second, some explicit learning is typically 

involved on the arti˚ cial grammar learning task 

and the serial reaction time task (e.g., Destrebecqz 

et al., 2005; Shanks et al., 2005; Wilkinson & 

Shanks, 2004). Third, the brain areas underlying 

what are claimed to be explicit and implicit learn-

ing are not always clearly different (e.g., Schendan, 

Searl, Melrose, & Stern, 2003).
What conclusions can we draw about implicit 
learning? It is too often assumed that ˚
 nding 
"
Segment_412,that explicit learning plays some part in explain-  ing performance on a given task means that   no  implicit learning occurred. It is very likely   that the extent to which learners are consciously   aware of what they are learning varies from   individual to individual and from task to task.

ing performance on a given task means that

 implicit learning occurred. It is very likely 

that the extent to which learners are consciously 

aware of what they are learning varies from 

individual to individual and from task to task. 

One possibility is that we have greatest conscious 

awareness when the representations of what 

we have learned are stable, distinctive, and strong, 

and least when those representations are unstable, 

non-distinctive, and weak (Kelly, 2003). All kinds 

of intermediate position are also possible.
Sun, Zhang, and Mathews (2009) argued that 
learning nearly always involves implicit and 

explicit aspects, and that the balance between 

these two types of learning changes over time. 

On some tasks, there is initial implicit learning 

based on the performance of successful actions 

followed by explicit learning of the rules apparently 

explaining why those actions are successful. 
On other tasks, learners start with explicit rules 

and then engage in implicit learning based on 

observing their actions directed by those rules.
THEORIES OF 
FORGETTING
Forgetting was ˚
 rst studied in detail by 
Hermann Ebbinghaus (1885/1913). He carried 
out numerous studies with himself as the only 

participant (not a recommended approach!). 

Ebbinghaus initially learned a list of nonsense 

syllables lacking meaning. At various intervals 

of time, he recalled the nonsense syllables. 

He then re-learned the list. His basic measure 

of forgetting was the 
savings method
, which 

involved seeing the reduction in the number of 

trials during re-learning compared to original 

learning. Forgetting was very rapid over the 

˚
 rst hour after learning but slowed down 
considerably after that (see Figure 6.15). These 

˚
 ndings suggest that the forgetting function is 
approximately logarithmic.
Rubin and Wenzel (1996) analysed the 
forgetting functions taken from 210 data sets 

invol"
Segment_413,"ving numerous memory tests. They found   (in line with Ebbinghaus (1885/1913) that a   logarithmic function most consistently described   the rate of forgetting (for alternative possibilities,   see Wixted, 2004). The major exception was   autobiographical memory, which showed slower   forgetting.

They found 

(in line with Ebbinghaus (1885/1913) that a 

logarithmic function most consistently described 

the rate of forgetting (for alternative possibilities, 

see Wixted, 2004). The major exception was 

autobiographical memory, which showed slower 

forgetting. One of the possible consequences of 

a logarithmic forgetting function is Jost™s (1897) 

law: if two memory traces differ in age but are 

of equal strength, the older one will decay more 

slowly over any given time period.
Most studies of forgetting have focused on 
declarative or explicit memory (see Chapter 7), 

which involves conscious recollection of 
savings method:
 a measure of forgetting 
introduced by Ebbinghaus, in which the number 

of trials for re-learning is compared against the 

number for original learning.

previously learned information. Comparisons 
of forgetting rates in explicit and implicit 

memory (in which conscious recollection is not  

required) suggest that forgetting is slower in 

implicit memory. Tulving, Schacter, and Stark 

(1982) carried out a study in which participants 

initially learned a list of relatively rare words 

(e.g., ﬁtobogganﬂ). One hour or one week later, 

they received a test of explicit memory (recogni-

tion memory) or a word-fragment completion 

test of implicit memory. Word fragments (e.g., 

_ O _ O _ GA _) were presented and participants 

˚
 lled in the blanks to form a word without 
being 
told that any of the words came from 
the list studied previously. Recognition memory 

was much worse after one week than one hour, 

whereas word-fragment completion performance 

was unchanged.
Dramatic evidence of long-lasting implicit 
memories was reported by Mitchell (2006). 

His participants tried to identify pictures from 

fragments having seen som"

They did signi˚ cantly better with the pictures 

seen before; thus providing strong evidence for 

implicit memory after all those years! In contrast, 

there was rather little explicit memory for the 

experiment 17 years earlier. A 36-year-old male 

participant confessed, ﬁI™m sorry Œ I don™t really 

remember this experiment at all.ﬂ
In what follows, we will be discussing the 
major theories of forgetting in turn. As you 

read about these theories, bear in mind that 

they are not mutually exclusive. Thus, it is entirely  

possible that all the theories discussed identify 

some of the factors responsible for forgetting.
Interference theory
The dominant approach to forgetting during 

much of the twentieth century was interference 

theory. According to this theory, our ability to 

remember what we are currently learning can 

be disrupted (interfered with) by previous learn-

ing (proactive interference) or by future learning 

(retroactive interference) (see Figure 6.16).
Interference theory dates back to Hugo 
Munsterberg in the nineteenth century. For 

many years, he kept his pocket-watch in one 

particular pocket. When he moved it to a 

different pocket, he often fumbled about in 

confusion when asked for the time. He had 

learned an association between the stimulus, 

ﬁWhat time is it, Hugo?ﬂ, and the response of 

removing the watch from his pocket. Later on, 

the stimulus remained the same. However, a 

different response was now associated with it, 

thus causing proactive interference.
Research using methods such as those 
shown in Figure 6.16 revealed that proactive

and retroactive interference are both maximal 
when two different responses are associated 

with the same stimulus and minimal when two 

different stimuli are involved (Underwood & 

Postman, 1960). Strong evidence of retroactive 

interference has been obtained in studies of 

eyewitness testimony in which memory of an 

event is interfered with by post-event informa-

tion (see Chapter 8).
Proactive interference
Proactive interference can be very useful when 

circumstances change. For example, if you have 

re-arranged everything in your room, it is a 

real advantage to forget where your belongings 

used to be.
Most research on proactive interference 
has involved declarative or explicit memory. 

An exception was a study by Lustig and Hasher 

(2001). They used a word-fragment completion 

task (e.g., A _ L _ _ GY), on which participants  

wrote down the Þ
 rst appropriate word coming 
to mind. Participants previously exposed to words 

almost Þ
 tting the fragments (e.g., ANALOGY) 
showed evidence of proactive interference.
Jacoby, Debner, and Hay (2001) argued 
that proactive interference might occur for two 

reasons. First, it might be due to problems in 
retrieving the correct response (discriminability) .  

Second, it might be due to the great strength of  

the incorrect response learned initially (bias or 

habit). Thus, we might show proactive interference 

because the correct response is very weak or 

because the incorrect response is very strong. 

Jacoby et al. found consistently that proactive 

interference was due more to strength of the 

incorrect Þ rst response than to discriminability.
At one time, it was assumed that indi-
viduals 
passively
 allow themselves to suffer from 
interference. Suppose you learn something but 

Þ
 nd your ability to remember it is impaired by 
proactive interference from something learned 

previously. It would make sense to adopt active 

strategies to minimise any interference effect."
Segment_416,"Kane and Engle (2000) argued that individuals   with high working-memory capacity (correlated   with intelligence) would be better able to resist   proactive interference than those with low   capacity.

time as

been tested in several studies using the Recent 
Probes task. A small set of items (target set) is 

presented, followed by a recognition probe. 

The task is to decide whether the probe is a 

member of the target set. On critical trials, the 

probe is 
not
 a member of the current target 

set but was a member of the target set used on 

the previous trial. There is clear evidence of 

proactive interference on these trials in the 

form of lengthened reaction times and increased 

error rates.

found that the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex 

was activated on such trials. The same brain 

area was also activated on a directed forgetting 

version of the Recent Probes task (i.e., parti-

cipants were told to forget some of the target 

set items). This suggests that left ventrolateral 

prefrontal cortex may play an important role 

in suppressing unwanted information.
Nee et al.™s (2007) study could not show 
that left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex actually 

controls the effects of proactive interference. 

More direct evidence was reported by Feredoes, 

Tononi, and Postle (2006). They administered 

transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS; see 

Glossary) to left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. 
This produced a signi˚ cant increase in the error 

rate on proactive interference trials, suggesting 

that this brain area is directly involved in attempts 

to control proactive interference.
Retroactive interference
Numerous laboratory studies using arti˚
 cial 
tasks such as paired-associate learning (see 

Figure 6.16) have produced large retroactive 

interference effects. Such ˚ndings do not nec-

essarily mean that retroactive interference is 

important in everyday life. However, Isurin 

and McDonald (2001) argued that retroactive 

interference explains why people forget some 

of their ˚
 rst language when acquiring a second 
one. Bilingual participants ˜ uent in two lan-

guages were ˚ rst presented with various pic-

tures and the corresponding words in Russian 

or Hebrew. Some were then presented with the 

same pictures and the corresponding words in 

the other language. Finally, they were tested 

for recall of the words in the ˚
 rst language. 
There was substantial retroactive interference 

Œ recall of the ˚rst-language words became

progressively worse the more learning trials 

there were with the second-language words.

6 LEARNING, MEMORY, AND FORGETTING 
237
Sala (2007) found retroactive interference even 
when no new learning occurred during the 

retention interval. In their experiment, parti-

cipants learned a list of words and were then 

exposed to various tasks during the retention 

interval before list memory was assessed. There 

was signi˚ cant retroactive interference even 

when the intervening task involved detecting 

differences between pictures or detecting tones. 

Dewar et al. concluded that retroactive inter-

ference can occur in two ways: (1) expenditure 

of mental effort during the retention interval; 

or (2) learning of material similar to the original 

learning material. The ˚
 rst cause of retroactive 
interference probably occurs more often than 

the second in everyday life.
Lustig, Konkel, and Jacoby (2004) identi-
˚
 ed two possible explanations for retroactive 
interference in paired-associate learning. First, 

there may be problems with controlled pro-

cesses (active searching for the correct response). 

Second, there may be problems with automatic 

processes (high accessibility of the incorrect 

response). They identi˚ed the roles of these 

two kinds of processes by assessing retroactive 

interference in two different ways. One way 

involved direct instructions (i.e., deliberately 

retrieve the correct responses) and the other 

way involved indirect instructions (i.e., rapidly 

produce the ˚
 rst response coming to mind 
when presen"
Segment_419,"ted with the cue). Lustig et al.   assumed that direct instructions would lead to   the use of controlled and automatic processes,   whereas indirect instructions would primarily   lead to the use of automatic processes.

Lustig et al. 

assumed that direct instructions would lead to 

the use of controlled and automatic processes, 

whereas indirect instructions would primarily 

lead to the use of automatic processes.
What did Lustig et al. (2004) ˚
 nd? First, 
use of direct instructions was associated with 

signi˚
 cant retroactive interference on an im-
mediate memory test (cued recall) but not one 

day later. Second, the interference effect found 

on the immediate test depended mainly on 

relatively automatic processes (i.e., accessibil-

ity of the incorrect response). Third, the dis-

appearance of retroactive interference on the 

test after one day was mostly due to reduced 

accessibility of the incorrect responses. Thus, 

relatively automatic processes are of major 

importance in retroactive interference.
Evaluation
There is strong evidence for both proactive 

and retroactive interference. There has been 

substantial progress in understanding interfer-

ence effects in recent years, mostly involving 

an increased focus on underlying processes. 

For example, automatic processes make in-

correct responses accessible, and people use 

active control processes to minimise interference 

effects.
What are the limitations of interference 
theory? First, the emphasis has been on inter-

ference effects in declarative or explicit mem-

ory, and detailed information about interference 

effects in implicit memory is lacking. Second, 

interference theory explains why forgetting 

occurs but not directly why the rate of forget-

ting decreases over time. Third, more needs to 

be done to understand the brain mechanisms 

involved in interference and attempts to reduce 

interference.
Repression
One of the best-known theories of forget-

ting owes its origins to the bearded Austrian 

psychologist Sigmund Freud (1856 Œ1939). He 

claimed that very threatening or traumatic 

memories are often unable to gain access to 

conscious awareness, using the ter"

 to refer to this phenomenon. According 

to Freud (1915/1963, p. 86), ﬁThe essence 

of repression lies simply in the function of 

rejecting and keeping something out of con-

sciousness.ﬂ However, Freud sometimes used the 

concept to refer merely to the inhibition of the 

capacity for emotional experience (Madison, 

1956). Even though it is often believed that 

Freud regarded repression as unconscious, 

Erdelyi (2001) showed convincingly that Freud 

accepted that repression is sometimes an active 
repression:
 motivated forgetting of traumatic 
or other threatening events.

and intentional process. It is harder to test the 
notion of repression if it can be either uncon-

scious or conscious.
Most evidence relating to repression is 
based on adult patients who have apparently 

recovered repressed memories of childhood 

sexual and /or physical abuse in adulthood. As 

we will see, there has been ˚
 erce controversy 
as to whether these recovered memories are 

genuine or false. Note that the controversy 

centres on 
recovered 
memories Œ most experts 
accept that continuous memories (i.e., ones 

constantly accessible over the years) are very 

likely to be genuine.
Evidence
Clancy, Schacter, McNally, and Pitman (2000) 

used the DeeseŒRoedigerŒMcDermott para-

digm, which is known to produce false memo-

ries. Participants are given lists of semantically 

related words and are then found to falsely 

ﬁrecogniseﬂ other semantically related words 

not actually presented. Clancy et al. compared 

women with recovered memories of childhood 

sexual abuse with women who believed they 

had been sexually abused but could not recall 

the abuse, women who had always remem-
bered being abused, and female controls. 

Women reporting recovered memories showed 

higher levels of false "
Segment_421,"recognition than any other   group (see Figure 6.18), suggesting that these   women might be susceptible to developing false   memories.

Lief and Fetkewicz (1995) found that 80% 
of adult patients who admitted reporting false 

recovered memories had therapists who made 

direct suggestions that they had been the 

victims of childhood sexual abuse. This sug-

gests that recovered memories recalled 
inside
 
therapy may be more likely to be false than 

those recalled 
outside
 therapy (see box).
Motivated forgetting
Freud, in his repression theory, focused on 

some aspects of motivated forgetting. How-

ever, his approach was rather narrow, with its 

emphasis on repression of traumatic and other 

distressing memories and his failure to consider 

the cognitive processes involved. In recent years, 

a broader approach to motivated forgetting 

has been adopted.

239
Memories of abuse recovered inside and outside therapy
Geraerts, Schooler, Merckelbach, Jelicic, Haner, 
and Ambadar (2007) carried out an important 

study to test whether the genuineness of recovered 

memories depends on the context in which they 

were recovered.They divided adults who had 

suffered childhood sexual abuse into three groups: 

(1) those whose recovered memories had been 

recalled inside therapy; (2) those whose recovered 

memories had been recalled outside therapy; and 

(3) those who had continuous memories. Geraerts 

et al. discovered how many of these memori"

had corroborating evidence (e.g., someone else 

had also reported being abused by the same 

person; the per petrator had confessed) to provide 

an approximate assessment of validity.
What did Geraerts et al. (2007) Þ
 nd? There 
was corroborating evidence for 45% of the 

individuals in the continuous memory group, for 

37% of those who had recalled memories outside 

therapy, and for 0% of those who had recalled 

memories inside therapy. These Þ ndings suggest 

that recovered memories recalled outside therapy 

are much more likely to be genuine than those 

recalled inside therapy. In addition, those indi-

viduals whose memories were recalled outside 

therapy reported being much more sur prised at  
the existence of these memories than did those 

whose memories were recalled inside therapy. 

Presumably those whose recovered memories 

emerged inside therapy were unsurprised at 

these memories because they had previously 

been led to expect them by their therapist.
Geraerts et al. (2008) asked various groups 
of adults who claimed memories of childhood 

sexual abuse to recall the most positive and the 

most anxiety-provoking event they had experi-

enced during the past two years.The particip-

ants were then told to try to suppress thoughts 

relating to these events, and to keep a diary 

record of any such thoughts over the following 

week. Adults who had recovered memories 

outside therapy were much better at this than 
 
control participants, those who had recovered 

memories inside therapy, and those who had 

continuous memories. 
In sum, it appears that many of the traumatic 
memories recovered by women outside therapy 

are genuine.The finding that such women are 

especially good at suppressing emotional memories 

under laboratory conditions helps to explain why 

they were unaware of their traumatic memories 

for long periods of time prior to recovery.

function. In addition, much of the information 
we have stored in long-term memory is out-

dated or irrelevant, making it useless for pres-

ent purposes. For example, if you are looking 

for your car in a car park, there is no point in 

remembering where you have parked the car 

previously. Thus, motivated or intentional for-

getting can be adaptive (e.g., by reducing pro-

active interference).
Directed forgetting
Directed forgetting
 is a phenomenon involv-

ing impaired long-term memory caused by an 

instruction to forget some information pre-

sented for learning (see Geraerts & McNally, 

2008, for a review). Directed forgetting has 

been studied in two ways. First, there is the 

item method. Several words are presented, each 

followed immediately by an instruction to 

remember or to forget it. After all the words 

have been presented, participants are tested for 

their recall or recognition of 
all
 the words. 

Memory performance on recall and recognition 

tests is typically worse for the to-be-forgotten 

words than for the to-be-remembered words.
Second, there is the list method. Here, par-
ticipants receive two lists of words. After the 

˚
 rst list has been presented, participants are 
told to remember or forget the words. Then 

the second list is presented. After that, memory 

is tested for the words from both lists. Recall 

of the "
Segment_424,"words from the ˚ rst list is typically   impaired when participants have been told to   forget those words compared to when they   have been told to remember them. However,   there is typically no effect when a recognition   memory test is used. Why  does directed forgetting occur?

impaired when participants have been told to 

forget those words compared to when they 

have been told to remember them. However, 

there is typically no effect when a recognition 

memory test is used.
Why
 does directed forgetting occur? 
Directed forgetting with the item method is 

found with both recall and recognition, sug-

gesting that the forget instruction has its effects  

during learning. For example, it has often been 

suggested that participants may selectively re-

hearse remember items at the expense of forget 

items (Geraerts & McNally, 2008). This ex-

planation is less applicable to the list method, 

because participants have had a substantial 

opportunity to rehearse the to-be-forgotten list 
items before being instructed to forget them. 

The ˚ nding that directed forgetting with the 

list method is not found in recognition memory 

suggests that directed forgetting in recall involves 

retrieval inhibition or interference (Geraerts & 

McNally, 2008).
Inhibition: executive deÞ
 cit hypothesis
A limitation with much of the research is that 

the precise reasons 
why
 directed forgetting has 
occurred are unclear. For example, consider 

directed forgetting in the item-method para-

digm. This could occur because to-be-forgotten 

items receive much less rehearsal than to-

be-remembered items. However, it could also 

occur because of an active process designed 

to inhibit the storage of words in long-term 

memory. Wylie, Foxe, and Taylor (2007) used 

fMRI with the item-method paradigm to test 

these rival hypotheses. In crude terms, we might 

expect 
less
 brain activity for to-be-forgotten 
items than to-be-remembered ones if the former 

simply attract less processing. In contrast, we 

might expect 
more
 brain activity for to-be-

forgotten items if active processes are involved. 

In fact, intentional forgetting when compared 

with intentional remembering was associated

Finally, all the cues are presented and parti-
cipants provide the correct target words. Levy 

and Anderson (2008) carried out a meta-analysis  

of studies using the think /no-think paradigm. 

There was clear evidence of directed forgetting 

(see Figure 6.20). The additional ˚
 nding that 
recall was worse in the suppress condition than 

in the baseline condition indicates that inhi-

bitory processes were involved in producing 

directed forgetting in this paradigm.
What strategies do participants use in the 
suppress condition? They report using numer-

ous strategies, including forming mental images, 

thinking of an alternative word or thought, or 

repeating the cue word (Levy & Anderson, 

2008). Bergstrom, de Fockert, and Richardson-

Klavehn (2009) manipulated the strategy used. 

Direct suppression of the to-be-forgotten words 

was more effective than producing alternative 

thoughts.
Anderson et al. (2004) focused on indi-
vidual differences in memory performance

having the greatest activation in bilateral dorso-

lateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex were 

most successful at memory inhibition. Memory 

inhibition was also associated with reduced 

hippocampal activation Œ this is revealing 

because the hippocampus plays a key role in 

episodic memory (see Chapter 7). These ˚
 ndings 
suggest that successful intentional forgetting 

involves an executive control process in the 

prefrontal cortex that disengages hippocampal 

processing.
Additional support for the executive de˚
 cit 
hypothesis was reported by Bell and Anderson 

(in preparation). They compared individuals 

high and low in working memory capacity (see 

Chapter 10), a dimension of individual differ-

ences strongly related to executive control and 

intelligence. As predicted, memory suppression  

in the think/no-think paradigm was signi˚
 cantly 
greater in the high capacity group.
Is research using the think /no-think para-
digm relevant to repression? There are encour-

aging signs that it is. First, Depue, Banich, and 

Curran (2006, 2007) had participants learn to 

pair unfamiliar 
faces with unpleasant photo-

graphs (e.g., a 
badly deformed 
infant; a car 
accident) using the paradigm. The ˚
 ndings 
were very similar 
to those of Anderson et al. 
(2004). There was clear evidence for suppression 

of unwanted memories and suppression was 

associated with increased activation of the 

lateral prefrontal cortex and reduced hippocampal 

activity. Second, Anderson and Kuhl (in pre-

paration) found that individuals who had 

experienced several traumatic events showed 

superior memory inhibition abilities than those 

who had experienced few or none. This suggests

control processes within the frontal lobes has 
received much empirical support. The exten-

sion of this hypothesis to account for individual 

differences in directed forgetting has also been 

well supported. In addition, the notion that 

research on directed forgetting may be of 

genuine relevance to an understanding of re-

pression is important. A major implication of 

directed forgetting research is that suppres-

sion or repression occurs because of deliberate 

attempts to control awareness rather than 

occurring unconsciously and automatically, as 

suggested by Freud.
Directed forgetting is clearly one way in 
which forgetting occurs. However, most forget-

ting occurs in spite of our best efforts to remem-

ber, and so the directed forgetting approach is 

not of general applicability. The suppression 

effect in the think/no-think paradigm (baselineŒ

suppression conditions) averages out at only 

6% (see Figure 6.20), suggesting it is rather 

weak. However, participants spent an average 

of only 64 seconds trying to suppress each item, 

which is presumably massively less than the 

amount of time many individuals devote to 

suppressing traumatic memories. Most research 

on directed forgetting has used neutral and

 cial learning materials, and this limits our 
ability to relate the ˚
 ndings to Freud™s ideas 
about repression.
Cue-dependent forgetting
Forgetting often occurs because we lack the 

appropriate cues (cue-dependent forgetting). 

For example, suppose you are struggling to 

think of the name of the street on which a friend 

of yours lives. If someone gave you a short list 

of possible street names, you might have no 

dif˚
 culty in recognising the correct one.
Tulving and Psotka (1971) showed the 
importance of cues. They presented between 

one and six word lists, with four words in six 

different categories in each list. After each list, 

participants free recalled as many words as 

possible (original learning). After all the lists 

had been presented, participants free recalled 

the words from all the lists (total free recall). 

Finally, all the category names were presented 
and the participants tried again to recall all the 

words from all the lists (free cued recall).
There was strong evidence for retroactive 
interference in total free recall, since word 

recall from any given list decreased as the num-

ber of other lists intervening between learning 

and recall increased. However, there was essen-

tially 
no
 retroactive interference or forgetting 
when the category names were available to the 

participants. Thus, the forgetting observed in 

total free recall was basically cue-dependent 

forgetting (due to a lack of appropriate cues).
Tulving (1979) developed the notion of 
cue-dependent forgetting in his 
encoding speci-

˚ city principle
: ﬁThe probability of successful 

retrieval of the target item is a monotonically 

increasing function of 
informational overlap
 

between the information present at retrieval 

and the information stored in memoryﬂ (p. 408; 

emphasis added). If you are bewildered by that 

sentence, note that ﬁmonotonically increasing 

functionﬂ refers to a generally rising function 

that does not decrease"

item generally consists of the item itself plus 

information about context (e.g., the setting; 

current mood state). It follows that memory 

performance should be best when the context 

at test is the same as that at the time of 

learning.
The encoding speci˚ city principle resembles 
the notion of transfer-appropriate processing 

(Morris et al., 1977; see earlier in chapter). 

The central idea behind transfer-appropriate 

processing is that long-term memory is best 

when the processing performed at the time of 

test closely resembles that at the time of learning. 

The main difference between these two notions 

is that transfer-appropriate processing focuses 

more directly on the processes involved.

6 LEARNING
, MEMORY, AND FORGETTING 
243
Evidence
Many attempts to test the encoding specifi-
city principle involve two learning conditions 

and two retrieval conditions. This allows the 

researcher to show that memory depends on 

the information in the memory trace 
and
 the 

information available in the retrieval environ-

ment. Thomson and Tulving (1970) presented 

pairs of words in which the ˚ rst was the cue 

and the second was the to-be-remembered word. 

The cues were weakly associated with the list 

words (e.g., ﬁTrainŒBLACKﬂ) or strongly 

associated (e.g., ﬁWhiteŒBLACKﬂ). Some of 

the to-be-remembered items were 
tested by weak 
cues (e.g., ﬁTrainŒ?ﬂ), and others 
were tested 
by strong cues (e.g., ﬁWhiteŒ?ﬂ).

Any 
change in the cues reduced recall, even when 

the shift was from weak cues at input to strong 

cues at recall. Why were strong cues associated 

with relatively poor memory performance 

when learning had involved weak cues? Tulving 

assumed that participants found it easy to gen-
erate the to-be-remembered words to strong 

cues, but failed to recognise them as appro-

priate. However, that is not the whole story. 

Higham and Tam (2006) found that parti-

cipants given strong cues at test after weak 

cues at learning found it harder to generate the 

target words than other participants given 

strong cues at test who had not previously 

engaged in any learning! This happened because 

participants given weak cues at learning had 

formed a mental set to generate mainly weak 

associates to cues.
Context is important in determining forget-
ting. For example, information about current 

mood state is often stored in the memory 

trace, and there is more forgetting if the mood 

state at the time of retrieval is different. The 

notion that there should be less forgetting 

when the mood state at learning and retrieval 

is the same is known as mood-state-dependent 

memory. There is reasonable evidence for mood-

state-dependent memory (see Chapter 15). 

However, the effect is stronger when parti-

cipants are in a positive rather than negative 

mood because they are motivated to alter 

negative moods.

or English language. The participants generated 

Russian memories (based on experiences in a 

Russian-speaking context) to 64% of the cues 

in Russian compared to only 35% when the 

cues were in English.
The effects of context are often stronger 
in recall than recognition memory. Godden and 

Baddeley (1975) asked participants to learn a 

list of words on land or 20 feet underwater, 

followed by a test of free recall on land or 

under water. Those who had learned on land 

recalled more on land and those who learned 

underwater did better when tested underwater. 

Overall, recall was about 50% higher when 

learning and recall took place in the same 

environment. However, there was no effect of 

context when Godden and Baddeley (1980) 

repeated the experiment using recognition 

memory rather than recall.
We all know that recognition is generally 
better than recall. For example, we may be 

unable to recall the name of an acquaintance 

but if someone mentions their name we in-
stantly recognise it. One of the most dramatic 

predictions from the encoding speci˚
 city prin-
ciple is that recall should sometimes be better 

than recognition. This should happen when 

the information in the recall cue overlaps more 

than the information in the recognition cue 

with the information stored in the memory 

trace. Muter (1978) presented participants with 

people™s names (e.g., DOYLE, THOMAS) and 

asked them to circle those they ﬁrecognised as 

a person who was famous before 1950ﬂ. They 

were then given recall cues in the form of brief 

descriptions plus ˚
rst names of the famous 
people whose surnames had appeared on the 

recognition test (e.g., author of the Sherlock 

Holmes stories: Sir Arthur Conan _____; Welsh 

poet: Dylan ______). Participants recognised 

only 29% of the names but recalled 42% 

of them.

conditions) or an incongruent cue (wordŒpicture 

and pictureŒword conditions). As predicted by 

the encoding speci˚
 city principle, memory per-
formance was better in the congruent than in 

the incongruent conditions.
Park and Rugg (2008) carried out a fur-
ther analysis based on brain activity at learning 

for items subsequently recognised. According 

to transfer-appropriate processing, it is more 

important for successful recognition for words 

to be processed at learning in a ﬁword-likeﬂ way  

if they are tested by picture cues than by word 

cues. In similar fashion, successful recognition 

of pictures should depend more on ﬁpicture-

likeﬂ processing at study if they are tested by 

pictures cues than by word cues. Both pre-

dictions were supported, suggesting that long-

term memory is best when the processing at 

the time of learning is similar to that at the 

time of retrieval.

Evaluation
The overlap between the information stored 

in the memory trace and that available at the 

time of retrieval often plays an important role 

in determining whether retrieval occurs. Recent 

neuroimaging evidence supports both the encod-

ing 
speci˚
 city principle and transfer-appropriate 
processing. The emphasis placed on the role 

of contextual information in retrieval is also 

valuable. As we have seen, several different kinds 

of context (e.g., external cues; internal mood 

states; linguistic context) in˜
 uence memory 
performance.
What are the limitations of Tulving™s 
approach? First, it is most directly applicable 

to relatively simple memory tasks. Tulving 

assumed that the information at the time of 

test is compared in a simple and direct way 

with the information stored in memory to 

assess informational overlap. That is probably 

often the case, as when we effortlessly recall 

autobiographical memories when in the same 

place as the original event (Berntsen & Hall, 

2004). However, if you tried to answer the 

question, ﬁWhat did you do six days ago?, you 

would probably use complex problem-solving 

strategies not included within the encoding 

speci˚ city principle.
Second, the encoding speci˚
 city principle 
is based on the assumption that retrieval 

occurs fairly automatically. However, that is 

not always the case. Herron and Wilding (2006) 

found that active processes can be involved 

in retrieval. People found it easier to recollect 

episodic memories relating to when and where 

an event occurred when they adopted the 

appropriate mental set or frame of mind before-

hand. Adopting this mental set was associated 
with increased brain activity in the right frontal 

cortex.
Third, there is a danger of circularity 
(Eysenck, 1978). Memory is said to depend on 

ﬁinformational overlapﬂ, but this is rarely 

measu"
Segment_434,"red. It is tempting to infer the amount of   informational overlap from the level of memory   performance, which is circular reasoning. Fourth, as Eysenck (1979) pointed out,  what matters is not only the informational   overlap between retrieval information and   stored information but also the ext",Explores how emotion influences cognition.,"perception, recognition, emotion",Nested under Chapter on awareness,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in attention,Aligned with contemporary studies on emotion,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_701,"red. It is tempting to infer the amount of 

informational overlap from the level of memory 

performance, which is circular reasoning.
Fourth, as Eysenck (1979) pointed out, 
what matters is not only the informational 

overlap between retrieval information and 

stored information but also the extent to which 

retrieval information allows us to 
discriminate
 
the correct responses from the incorrect ones. 

Consider the following thought experiment 

(Nairne, 2002b). Participants read aloud the 

following list of words: write, right, rite, rite, 

write, right. They are then asked to recall the 

word in the third serial position. We increase 

the informational overlap for some participants 

by providing them with the sound of the item in  

the third position. This increased informational 

overlap is totally unhelpful because it does not 

allow participants to discriminate the correct 

spelling of the sound from the wrong ones.
Fifth, Tulving assumed that context in˜
 u-
ences recall and recognition in the same way. 

However, the effects of context are often greater 

on recall than on recognition memory (e.g., 

Godden & Baddeley, 1975, 1980).
Consolidation
None of the theories considered so far provides 

a wholly convincing account of forgetting over 

time. They identify factors causing forgetting, 

but do not indicate clearly why forgetting is 

greater shortly after learning than later on. 

Wixted (2004a, 2005) argued that the secret 

of forgetting may lie in consolidation theory. 

Consolidation

consolidation:
 a process lasting several hours

episodes), with many memories being stored 

ultimately in various parts of the neocortex, 

including the temporal lobes. A key assumption 

is that recently formed memories still being 

consolidated are especially vulnerable to inter-

ference and forgetting. Thus, ﬁNew memories 

are clear but fragile and old ones are faded but 

robustﬂ (Wixted, 2004a, p. 265).
According to some versions of consolidation 
theory (e.g., Eichenbaum, 2001), the process 

of consolidation involves two major phases. 

The ˚rst phase occurs over a period of hours 

and centres on the hippocampus. The second 

phase takes place over a period of time ranging 

from days to years and involves interactions 

between the hippocampal region, adjacent 

entorhinal cortex and the neocortex. This 

second phase only applies to episodic memories  

and semantic memories (stored knowledge about 

the world). It is assumed that such memories 

are stored in the lateral neocortex of the temporal 

and other lobes.
Consolidation theory is relevant to two of 
the oldest laws of forgetting (Wixted, 2004b). 

First, there is Jost™s (1897) law (mentioned 

earlier), according to which the older of two 

memories of the same strength will decay 

slower. According to the theory, the explana-

tion is that the older memory has undergone 

more consolidation and so is less vulnerable. 

Second, there is Ribot™s (1882) law, according 

to which the adverse effects of brain injury on 

memory are greater on newly formed memories 

than older ones. This is temporally graded 

retrograde amnesia. It can be explained on the 

basis that newly formed memories are most 

vulnerable to disruption because they are at 

an early stage of consolidation.
Evidence
Several lines of evidence support consolidation 

theory. First, consider the form of the forgetting 
curve. A decreasing rate of forgetting over time

cent memories are vulnerable due to an ongoing 

process of consolidation. Consolidation theory 

also provides an explanation of Jost™s law.
Second, there is research on Ribot™s law, 
which claims that brain damage adversely 

affects recently-formed memories more than 

older ones. Such research focuses on patients 

with 
retrograde amnesia
, which involves 
impaired memory for events occurring before 

the onset of the amnesia. Many of these patients 

have suffered damage to the hippocampus as 

the result of an accident, and this may have 

a permanently adverse effect on consolida 
tion 
processes. As predicted by consolidation theory, 

numerous patients with retrograde amnesia 

show greatest forgetting for those memories 

formed very shortly before the onset of amnesia 

(Manns, Hopkins, & Squire, 2003). However, 

retrograde amnesia can in extreme cases extend 

for periods of up to 40 years (Cipolotti et al., 

2001).
Third, consolidation theory predicts that 
newly-formed memories are more susceptible 

to retroactive interference than are older 

memories. On the face of it, the evidence is 

inconsistent. The amount of retroactive inter-

ference generally does not depend on whether 

the interfering material is presented early or 

late in the retention interval (see Wixted, 2005,  

for a review). However, the great majority of 

studies have only considered speci˚
 c retroactive 
interference (i.e., two responses associated 

with the same stimulus). Consolidation theory 

actually claims that newly-formed memories 

are more susceptible to interference from
 
any 
subsequent learning. When the interfering 
material is dissimilar, there is often more retro-

active interference when it is presented early 

in the retention interval (Wixted, 2004a).

events occurring before the onset of amnesia.

Fourth, consider the effects of alcohol on

of alcohol sometimes suffer from ﬁblackoutﬂ, 

an almost total loss of memory for all events 

occurring while they were conscious but very 

drunk. These blackouts probably indicate a 

failure to consolidate memories formed while 

intoxicated. An interesting (and somewhat 

surprising) ˚ nding is that memories formed 

shortly 
before
 alcohol consumption are often 
better remembered than those formed by indi-

viduals who do not subsequently drink alcohol 

(Bruce & Pihl, 1997). Alcohol probably prevents 

the formation of new memories that would 

interfere with the consolidation process of the 

memories formed just before alcohol consump-

tion. Thus, alcohol protects previously formed 

memories from disruption.
Fifth, Haist, Gore, and Mao (2001) obtained 
support for the assumption that consolidation 

consists of two phases. Participants identi˚
 ed 
faces of people famous in the 1980s or 1990s. 

Selective activation of the hippocampus for 

famous faces relative to non-famous ones was 

only found for those famous in the 1990s. In 

contrast (and also as predicted), there was 

greater activation in the entorhinal cortex con-

nected to widespread cortical areas for famous 

faces from the 1980s than from the 1990s.
Evaluation
Consolidation theory has various successes to 

its credit. First, it explains 
why
 the rate of 
forgetting decreases over time. Second, con-

solidation theory successfully predicts that retro-

grade amnesia is greater for recently formed 

memories and that retroactive interference 

effects are greatest shortly after learning. Third, 

consolidation theory identifies the brain 

areas most associated with the two phases of 

consolidation.
What are the limitations of consolidation 
theory? First, we lack strong evidence that 

consolidation processes are responsible f"

the effects attributed to them. For example, 

there are various possible reasons why newly 

formed memories are more easily disrupted 

than older ones. Second, consolidation theory 

indicates in a 
general
 way why newly formed 

memory traces are especially susceptible to 

interference effects, but not the more 
speci˚ c
 

˚
 nding that retroactive interference is greatest 
when two different responses are associated 

with the same stimulus. Third, forgetting can 

involve several factors other than consolida-

tion. For example, forgetting is greater when 

there is little informational overlap between 

the memory trace and the retrieval environment 

(i.e., encoding speci˚ city principle), but this 

˚
 nding cannot be explained within consolida-
tion theory. Fourth, consolidation theory 
ignores 
cognitive processes in˜
 uencing 
forgetting. 
For 
example, as we have seen, the extent to which 

forgetting due to proactive interference occurs 

depends on individual differences in the ability to  

inhibit or suppress the interfering information.
 Architecture of memory
† 
According to the multi-store model, there are separate sensory, short-term, and long-term 

stores. Much evidence (e.g., from amnesic patients) provides general support for the model, 

but it is clearly oversimpli˚
 ed. According to the unitary-store model, short-term memory 
is the temporarily activated part of long-term memory. There is support for this model 

in the ˚ nding that amnesics™ performance on some ﬁshort-term memoryﬂ tasks is impaired. 

However, it is likely that long-term memory plays an important role in determining per-

formance on such tasks.

 Working memory
† 
Baddeley replaced the unitary short-term store with a working memory system consisting 
of an attention-like central executive, "
Segment_439,"a phonological loop holding speech-based informa-  tion, and a visuo-spatial sketchpad specialised for spatial and visual coding. More recently,   Baddeley has added a fourth component (episodic buffer) that integrates and holds infor - mation from various sources.

tion, and a visuo-spatial sketchpad specialised for spatial and visual coding. More recently, 

Baddeley has added a fourth component (episodic buffer) that integrates and holds infor
-
mation from various sources. The phonological loop and visuo-spatial sketchpad are both 

two-component systems, one for storage and one for processing. The central executive 

has various functions, including inhibition, shifting, updating, and dual-task co-ordination. 

Some brain-damaged patients are said to suffer from dysexecutive syndrome, but detailed 

analysis indicates that different brain regions are associated with the functions of task 

setting, monitoring, and energisation.
 Levels of processing
† 
Craik and Lockhart (1972) focused on learning processes in their levels-of-processing 

theory. They identi˚
 ed depth of processing (the extent to which meaning is processed), 
elaboration of processing, and distinctiveness of processing as key determinants of long-

term memory. Insuf˚ cient attention was paid to the relationship between processes at 

learning and those at retrieval. In addition, the theory isn™t explanatory, it is hard to assess 

processing depth, and shallow processing can lead to very good long-term memory.
 Implicit learning
† 
Much evidence supports the distinction between implicit and explicit learning, and amnesic 

patients often show intact implicit learning but impaired explicit learning. In addition, 

the brain areas activated during explicit learning (e.g., prefrontal cortex) differ from those 

activated during implicit learning (e.g., striatum). However, it has proved hard to show 

that claimed demonstrations of implicit learning satisfy the information and sensitivity 

criteria. It is likely that the distinction between implicit and explicit learning is oversimpli-

˚
 
ed, and that more complex theoretical formulations are required.
 Theories of forgetting

the laboratory. People use active control processes to minimise proactive interference. 

Much retroactive interference depends on automatic processes making the incorrect 

responses accessible. Most evidence on Freud™
s repression theory is based on adults claim-
ing recovered memories of childhood abuse. Such memories when recalled outside therapy 

are more likely to be genuine than those recalled inside therapy. There is convincing 

evidence for directed forgetting, with executive control processes within the prefrontal 

cortex playing a major role. Forgetting is often cue-dependent, and the cues can be external 

or internal. However, decreased forgetting over time is hard to explain in cue-dependent 

terms. Consolidation theory provides an explanation for the form of the forgetting curve, 

and for reduced forgetting rates when learning is followed by alcohol.

INTRODUCTION
We have an amazing variety of information 

stored in long-term memory. For example, 

long-term memory can contain details of our 

last summer holiday, the fact that Paris is the 

capital of France, information about how to 

ride a bicycle or play the piano, and so on. 

Much of this information is stored in the form 

of schemas or organised packets of knowledge, 

and is used extensively during language com-

prehension. The relationship between schematic 

knowledge and language comprehension is 

discussed in Chapter 10.
In view of the variety of information in long-
term memory, Atkinson and Shiffrin™s (1968) 

notion that there is a single long-term 
memory  

store seems improbable (see Chapter 6).  A s  w e  

will see, it is generally accepted that 
there 
are several major long-term memory systems. 

For example, Schacter and Tulving (1994) 

argued that there are four major long-term 

memory systems (episodic memory, semantic 

memory, the perceptual representation system, 

and procedural memory), and their approach 

will be discussed. However, there has been 

some controversy about the precise number 

and nature of long-term memory systems.
What do we mean by a memory system?

W

patients are sometimes said to suffer from the 

ﬁamnesic syndromeﬂ consisting of the follow-

ing features:
Anterograde amnesia
† 
: a marked impairment 
in the ability to remember new information 

learned after the onset of amnesia. HM is 

a famous example of anterograde amnesia 

(see box).

Retrograde amnesia

: problems in remem-
bering events occurring prior to the onset

The famous case HM
HM was the most-studied amnesic patient of 

all time. He suffered from very severe epilepsy 

starting at the age of ten. This eventually led to 

surgery byWilliam Beecher Scoville, involving 

removal of the medial temporal lobes including 

the hippocampus. HM had his operation on 

23 August 1953, and since then he ﬁforgets the 

events of his daily life as fast as they occurﬂ 

(Scoville & Milner, 1957). More dramatically, 

Corkin (1984, p. 255) reported many years after 

the operation that HM, ﬁdoes not know where 

he lives, who cares for him, or where he ate 

his last meal.  .  .  .  In 1982 he did not recognise a 

picture of himself that had been taken on his 

fortieth birthday in 1966.ﬂWhen shown faces 

of individuals who had become famous after the 

onset of his amnesia, HM could only identify

In spite of 

everything, HM still had a sense of humour. 

When Suzanne Corkin asked him how he tried 

to remember things, he replied, ﬁWell, that 

I don™t know ™cause I don™t remember [laugh] 

what I triedﬂ (Corkin, 2002, p. 158).
It would be easy to imagine that all HM™s 
memory capacities were destroyed by surgery. 

In fact, what was most striking (and of greatest 

theoretical importance) was that he retained 

the ability to form many kinds of long-term 

memory as well as having good short-term mem-
ory (e.g., on immediate span tasks;Wickelgren, 

1968). For example, HM showed reasonable 

learning on a mirror-tracing task (drawing objects 

seen only in re˜ ection), and he retained some 

of this learning for one year (Corkin, 1968). He 

also showed learning on the pursuit rotor, which  

involves manual tracking of a moving target. HM 

showed normal performance on a perceptual 

identi˚ cation task in which he had to identify 

words presented very brie˜ y. He identi˚ ed 

more words previously studied than words not 

previously studied, thus showing evidence for 

long-term memory.
Some reports indicated that his language 
skills were reasonably well preserved. However, 

Mackay, James,Taylor, and Marian (2007) reported 

that he was dramatically worse than healthy 

controls at language tasks such as detecting 

grammatical errors or answering questions about 

who did what to whom in sentences.
HM died on 2 December 2008 at the age 
of 82. He was known only as HM to protect 

his privacy, but after his death it was revealed 

that his real name was Henry Gustav Molaison.
Researchers have focused on the patterns 
of intact and impaired memory performance 

shown by HM and other amnesic patients.The 

theoretical insights they have produced will be 

considered in detail in this chapter.

amnesic patients. Furthermore, such patients 
have provided some of the strongest evidence 

supporting these distinctions.
Declarative vs. non-declarative 
memory
The most important distinction between differ-
ent types of long-term memory is that between 

declarative memory and non-declarative memory.  

Declarative memory
 involves conscious recol-

lection of events and facts Œ it refers to memories 

that can be ﬁdeclaredﬂ or described. Declarative 

memory is sometimes referred to as 
explicit 
memory
, de˚ ned as memory that ﬁrequires 

conscious recollection of previous experiencesﬂ 

(Graf & Schacter, 1985, p. 501).
In contrast, 
non-declarative memory
 does 
not involve conscious recollection. Typically, 

we obtain evidence of non-declarative memory 

by observing changes in behaviour. For example, 

consider someone learning how to ride a bicycle. 

We would expect their cycling performance 

(a form of behaviour) to improve over time even 

though they could not consciously recollect 

what they had learned about cycling. Non-

declarative memory is also known as 
implicit 

memory
, which involves enhanced performance 

in the absence of conscious recollection.
factor causing amnesia, but closed head injury 

is the most common cause. However, patients 

with closed head injury often have several 

cognitive impairments, which makes interpret-

ing their memory de˚ cit hard. As a result, most  

experimental work has focused on patients who  

became amnesic because of chronic alcohol abuse  

(Korsakoff™s syndrome; see Glossary). There are 

two problems with using Korsakoff patients to 

study amnesia. First, the amnesia usually has 

a gradual onset, being caused by an increasing 

de˚
 ciency of the vitamin thiamine associated 
with chronic alcoholism. That makes it hard to  

know whether certain past events occurred before 

or after "
Segment_446,"the onset of amnesia. Second, brain dam-  age i n   Korsakoff patients is often rather wide-  spread. Structures within the diencephalon (e.g.,   the hippocampus and the amygdala) are usually   damaged. There is often damage to the frontal   lobes, and this can produce various cognitive   de˚  cits",Explores how memory influences cognition.,"emotion, attention, awareness",Nested under Chapter on perception,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in attention,Aligned with contemporary studies on awareness,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_183,"the onset of amnesia. Second, brain dam-

age i n  
Korsakoff patients is often rather wide-

spread. Structures within the diencephalon (e.g., 

the hippocampus and the amygdala) are usually 

damaged. There is often damage to the frontal 

lobes, and this can produce various cognitive 

de˚
 cits not speci˚ c to the memory system. It would 
be easier to inter pret ˚ ndings from Korsakoff 

patients if the brain damage were more limited. 

Other cases of amnesia typically have damage 

to the hippo campus and adjacent areas in the 

medial temporal lobes. The brain areas associated 

with amnesia are discussed more fully towards 

the end of the chapter.
Why
 have amnesic patients contributed 
substantially to our understanding of human 

memory? The study of amnesia provides a 

good 
test-bed
 for existing theories of healthy 
memory. For example, strong evidence for the 

distinction between short- and long-term memory 

comes from studies on amnesic patients (see 

Chapter 6). Some patients have severely impaired 

long-term memory but intact short-term memory, 

whereas a few patients show the opposite pat-

tern. The existence of these opposite patterns 

forms a double dissociation (see Glossary) and 

is good evidence for separate short- and long-

term stores.
The study of amnesic patients has also proved  
very valuable in leading to various theoretical 

developments. For example, distinctions such 

as the one between declarative or explicit 

memory and non-declarative or implicit memory 

(discussed in the next section) were originally 

proposed in part because of data collected from 
declarative memory:
 a form of long-term 
memory that involves knowing that something 

is the case and generally involves conscious 

recollection; it includes memory for facts 

(
semantic memory
) and memory for events 

(
episodic memory
).

extrastriate cortex, the left fusiform gyrus, and 
bilateral inferior prefrontal cortex, areas that 

are involved in stimulus identi˚
 cation.
Schott et al. (2005) found that different brain 
areas were associated with memory 
retrieval
 

on declarative memory and non-declarative 

tasks. Declarative retrieval was associated with 

bilateral parietal and temporal and left frontal 

increases in activation, whereas non-declarative 

retrieval was associated with decreases in acti-

vation in the left fusiform gyrus and bilateral 

frontal and occipital regions. Thus, the brain 

areas associated with declarative memory and 

non-declarative memory are different both at 

the time of encoding or learning and at the 

time of retrieval. In addition, retrieval from 

declarative memory is generally associated with
 
increased
 brain activation, whereas retrieval 

from non-declarative memory is associated 

with 
decreased
 brain activation.
For the rest of the chapter, we will discuss the  
various forms of declarative and non-d ec
larative 
memory. Figure 7.1 provides a 
sketch map of 

the ground we are going to be covering.
Declarative memory
We all have declarative or explicit memory for 

many different kinds of memories. For 
example, 
Declarative memory and non-declarative 
memory seem to be very different. Evidence 

for the distinction comes from amnesic patients. 

They seem to have great dif˚ culties in forming 

declarative memories but their ability to form 

non-declarative memories is intact or nearly 

so. In the "
Segment_448,"case of HM, he had extremely poor   declarative memory for personal events occur-  ring after the onset of amnesia and for faces   of those who had become famous in recent   decades (see Box on p. 252). However, he had   reasonable learning  ability on tasks such as   mirror tracing, the  pursuit ro",Explores how perception influences cognition.,"recognition, memory, awareness",Nested under Chapter on awareness,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in memory,Aligned with contemporary studies on recognition,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_341,"case of HM, he had extremely poor

of those who had become famous in recent

reasonable learning 
ability on tasks such as 

mirror tracing, the 
pursuit rotor, and percep-
tual identi˚ cation. What these otherwise dif-

ferent tasks have in common is that they all 

involve non-declarative memory. As we will see 

later in the chapter, the overwhelming majority 

of amnesic patients have very similar patterns 

of memory perform ance to HM.
Functional imaging evidence also supports

Tulving (2002, p. 5) clari˚ ed the relation-
ship between episodic and semantic memory: 

ﬁEpisodic memory . . . shares many features with  

semantic memory, out of which it grew, . . . but 

also possesses features that semantic memory 

does not. . . . Episodic memory is a recently 

evolved, 
late-developing, and early-deteriorating 
past-oriented memory system, more vulnerable 

than other memory systems to neuronal 

dysfunction.ﬂ
What is the relationship between episodic 
memory and autobiographical memory (dis-

cussed in Chapter 8)? They are similar in that 

both forms of memory are concerned with 

personal experiences from the past, and there is  

no clear-cut distinction between them. However, 

there are some differences. Much information 

in episodic memory is relatively trivial and is 

remembered for only a short period of time. 

In contrast, autobiographical memory stores 

information for long periods of time about 

events and experiences of some importance to 

the individual concerned.
Non-declarative memory
A de˚ ning characteristic of non-declarative 

memory is that it is expressed by behaviour 
we remember what we had for breakfast this 

morning or that ﬁle petit déjeunerﬂ is a French 

expression meaning ﬁbreakfastﬂ. T
ulving (1972) 
argued that these kinds of 
memories 
are very 
different, and he used the terms ﬁepisodic 

memoryﬂ and ﬁsemantic memoryﬂ to refer to 

the difference. 
Episodic memory
 involves storage 

(and retrieval) of speci˚ c events or episodes 

occurring in a given place at a given time. 

According to Wheeler, Stuss, and Tulving (1997, 

p. 333), the main distinguishing characteristic 

of episodic memory is, ﬁits dependence on 

a special"
Segment_450,"kind of awareness that all healthy   human adults can identify.

human adults can identify. It is the type of 

awareness experienced when one thinks back 

to a speci˚ c moment in one™s personal past and 

consciously recollects some prior episode or 

state as it was previously experienced.ﬂ
In contrast, 
semantic memory
 ﬁis the aspect 
of human memory that corresponds to general 

knowledge of objects, word meanings, facts and 

people, without connection to any particular 

time or placeﬂ (Patterson, Nestor, & Rogers, 

2007, p. 976). Wheeler et al. (1997) shed further 

light on the distinction between semantic and 

episodic memory. They pointed out that semantic  

memory involves ﬁknowing awarenessﬂ rather 

than the ﬁself-knowingﬂ associated with episodic 

memory.
Semantic memory goes beyond the meaning of 
words and extends to sensory attributes such as 

taste and colour; and to general knowledge of 

how society works, such as how to behave in a 

supermarket.

MEMORY
If episodic and semantic memory form separate 
memory systems, there should be several import-

ant differences between them. We will consider 

three major areas of research here.
The ˚ rst major area of research involves 
testing the ability of amnesic patients to acquire 

episodic and semantic memories after the onset 

of amnesia. In other words, the focus was 

on the extent of anterograde amnesia. Spiers, 

Maguire, and Burgess (2001) reviewed 147 

cases of amnesia involving damage to the 

hippocampus or fornix. There was impairment 

of episodic memory in 
all
 cases, whereas many 

of the patients had only modest problems with 

semantic memory. Thus, the impact of brain 

damage was much greater on episodic than on 

semantic memory, suggesting that the two types 

of memory are distinctly different. Note that 
and does not involve conscious recollection. 

Schacter et al. (2000) identi˚ ed two non-

declarative memory systems: the perceptual 

representation system and procedural memory: 

the 
perceptual representation system
 ﬁcan be 
viewed as a collection of domain-specific 

modules that operate on perceptual information 

about the form and structure of words and 

objectsﬂ (p. 635). Of central importance within 

this system is 
repetition
 
priming
 (often just called 
priming): stimulus processing occurs faster and/

or more easily on the second and successive 

presentations of a stimulus. For example, we 

may 
identify
 a stimulus more rapidly the second 
time it is presented than the ˚ rst time. What 

we have here is learning related to the 
speciÞ c
 

stimuli used during learning. Schacter, Wig, and 

Stevens (2007, p. 171) provided a more technical 

de˚
 nition: ﬁPriming refers to an improvement 
or change in the identi˚ cation, production, or 

classi˚
 cation of a stimulus as a result of a prior 
encounter with the same or a related stimulus.ﬂ 

The fact that repetition priming has been obtained 

in the visual, auditory, an"
Segment_452,"d touch modalities   supports the notion that there is a perceptual   representation system. In contrast,  procedural memory  ﬁrefers to  the learning of motor and cognitive skills, and   is manifest across a wide range of situations.

supports the notion that there is a perceptual 

representation system.
In contrast, 
procedural memory
 ﬁrefers to 
the learning of motor and cognitive skills, and 

is manifest across a wide range of situations. 

Learning to ride a bike and acquiring reading 

skills are examples of procedural memoryﬂ 

(Schacter et al., 2000, p. 636). The term ﬁskill 

learningﬂ has often been used to refer to what 

Schacter et al. de˚ ned as procedural memory. 

It is shown by learning that 
generalises
 to 

several stimuli other than those used during 

training. On the face of it, this seems quite 

different from the very speci˚
 c learning associ-
ated with priming.
Reference back to Figure 7.1 will indicate 
that there are other forms of non-declarative 

memory: classical conditioning, operant con-

ditioning, habituation, and sensitisation. We 

will refer to some of these types of memory 

later in the chapter as and when appropriate.
There is one ˚ nal point. The distinction 
between declarative or explicit memory and 

non-declarative or implicit memory has been 
perceptual representation system:
 an 
implicit memory system thought to be involved 

in the faster processing of previously presented 

stimuli (e.g., 
repetition
 
priming
).
repetition priming:
 the ˚ nding that stimulus 

processing is faster and easier on the second 

and successive presentations.

procedural memory/knowledge:
 this is 

concerned with knowing how, and includes the 

ability to perform skilled actions; see 

declarative memory

7 LONG-TERM MEMORY SYSTEMS

great problems with both episodic 
and semantic 
memory? The answer may be that they have 

damage to the hippocampus 
and
 to the under-

lying cortices. This makes sense given that the 

two areas are adjacent.
Some support for the above hypothesis was 
reported by Verfaellie, Koseff, and"
Segment_453,"Alexander   (2000). They studied a 40-year-old woman   (PS), who, as an adult, suffered brain damage   to the hippocampus but not the underlying   cortices. In spite of her severe amnesia and   greatly impaired episodic memory, she managed    to acquire new semantic memories (e.g., iden-  tifying p",Explores how recognition influences cognition.,"awareness, perception, attention",Nested under Chapter on memory,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in perception,Aligned with contemporary studies on emotion,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_236," Alexander 

(2000). They studied a 40-year-old woman 

(PS), who, as an adult, suffered brain damage 

to the hippocampus but not the underlying 

cortices. In spite of her severe amnesia and 

greatly impaired episodic memory, she managed  

to acquire new semantic memories (e.g., iden-

tifying people who only became famous after 

the onset of her amnesia).
We have seen that some amnesic patients 
perform relatively better on tasks involving seman-

tic memory than on those involving episodic 

memory. However, there is a potential problem 

of interpretation, because the opportunities for 

learning are generally greater with semantic 

memory (e.g., acquiring new vocabulary). Thus, 

one reason why these patients do especially 

poorly on episodic memory tasks may be because 

of the limited time available for learning.
The second main area of research involves 
amnesic patients suffering from retrograde 

amnesia (i.e., impaired memory for learning 

occurring before the onset of amnesia; see also 

Chapter 6). If episodic and semantic memory 

form different systems, we would expect to ˚
 nd 
some patients showing retrograde amnesia only 

for episodic or semantic memory. For example, 

consider KC, who suffered damage to several 

cortical and subcortical brain regions, including 

the medial temporal lobes. According to Tulving 

(2002, p. 13), ﬁ[KC™s] retrograde amnesia is 

highly asymmetrical: He cannot recollect any 

personally experienced events . . . , whereas his 

semantic knowledge acquired before the critical 

accident is still reasonably intact. His know-

ledge of mathematics, history, geography, and 

other ‚school subjects™, as well as his general 

knowledge of the world is not greatly different 

from others™ at his educational level.ﬂ
The opposite pattern was reported by

We would have stronger evidence if we could 
˚
 nd amnesic patients with very poor episodic 
memory but 
intact
 semantic memory. 
Such 

evidence was reported by Vargha
-Khadem, 

Gadian, Watkins, Connelly, Van Paesschen, and 

Mishkin (1997). They studied three patients, two 

of whom had suffered bilateral hippocampal 

damage at an early age before they had had 

the opportunity to develop semantic memories.  

Beth suffered brain damage at birth, and Jon 

did so at the age of four. Jon suffered breathing 

problems which led to anoxia and caused his 

hippocampus to be less than half the normal 
size.  

Both of these patients had very poor 
episodic 
memory for the day™s activities, television pro-

grammes, and telephone conversations. In spite 

of this, Beth and Jon both attended ordinary 

schools, and their levels of speech and language  

development, literacy, and factual knowledge 

(e.g., vocabulary) were within the normal range.
Vargha-Khadem, Gadian, and Mishkin (2002) 
carried out a follow-up study on Jon at the age 

of 20. As a young adult, he had a high level 

of intelligence (IQ 
=
 120), and his semantic 

memory continued to be markedly better than 

his episodic memory. Brandt, Gardiner, Vargha-

Khadem, Baddeley, and Mishkin (2006) obtained 

evidence suggesting that Jon™s apparent recall 

of information from episodic memory actually 

involved the use of semantic memory. Thus, 

Jon™s episodic memory may be even worse than 

was previously assumed.
How can we explain the ability of Beth 
and Jon to develop fairly normal semantic 

memory in spite of their grossly deficient 

episodic memory? Vargha-Khadem et al. (1997) 

argued that episodic memory depends on the 

hippocampus, whereas semantic memory depends

effects being limited to a period of about ten 
years. Third, damage to the neocortex impairs 

semantic memory. Westmacott, Black, Freedman,  

and Moscovitch (2004) studied retrograde 

amnesia in patients suffering from 
Alzheimer™s 

disease
 (a progressive disease in which cogni-

tive abilities including memory are gradually 

lost). The severity of retrograde amnesia for 

vocabulary and famous names in these patients 

increased with the progress of the disease. 

This suggests that the impairment in semantic 

memory was related to the extent of degenera-

tion of neocortex.
The third main area of research involves 
functional neuroimaging. Studies in this area 

indicate that episodic and semantic memory 

involve activation of somewhat different parts 

of the brain. In a review, Wheeler et al. (1997) 

reported that the left prefrontal cortex was more 

active during episodic than semantic encoding. 

What about brain activation during retrieval? 

Wheeler et al. reported that the right prefrontal 

cortex was more active during episodic memory 

retrieval than during semantic memory retrieval 

in 25 out of 26 neuroimaging studies.
Further neuroimaging evidence was reported 
by Prince, Tsukiura, and Cabeza (2007). The 

left hippocampus was associated with episodic 

encoding but not with semantic memory retrieval, 

whereas the lateral temporal cortex was asso-

ciated with semantic memory retrieval but not 

with episodic encoding. The greater involvement  

of the hippocampus with episodic than with 

semantic memory is consistent with the research 

on brain-damaged patients discussed above 

(Moscovitch et al., 2006). In addition, Prince "
Segment_456,"et al. (2007) found within the left inferior   prefrontal cortex that a posterior region was   involved in semantic retrieval, a mid-region was    associated with both semantic retrieval and   episodic encoding, and a more anterior region   was associated with episodic encoding only  temporal lobe",Explores how recognition influences cognition.,"perception, awareness, recognition",Nested under Chapter on attention,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in emotion,Aligned with contemporary studies on memory,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_753,"

et al. (2007) found within the left inferior 

prefrontal cortex that a posterior region was 

involved in semantic retrieval, a mid-region was  

associated with both semantic retrieval and 

episodic encoding, and a more anterior region 

was associated with episodic encoding only 
temporal lobe. She had very poor ability to 

remember public events, cultural items, historical 

˚
 gures, and some items of vocabulary from the 
time prior to the onset of amnesia. However, she  

was reasonably good at remembering personal 

experiences from episodic memory dating back 

to the pre-amnesia period.
Kapur (1999) reviewed studies on retro-
grade amnesia. There was clear evidence for a 

double dissociation: some patients showed more  

loss of episodic than semantic memory, whereas 

others showed the opposite pattern.
Which brain regions are involved in retro-
grade amnesia? The hippocampal complex of 

the medial temporal lobe (including the hippo-

campus proper, dentate gyrus, the perirhinal, 

enterorhinal, and parahippocampal cortices) 

is of special importance. According to multiple 

trace theory (e.g., Moscovitch, Nadel, Winocur, 

Gilboa, & Rosenbaum, 2006), every time an 

episodic memory is retrieved, it is re-encoded. 

This leads to multiple episodic traces of events 

distributed widely throughout the hippocampal 

complex. Of key importance, it is assumed 

theoretically that detailed episodic or autobio-

graphical memories of the past always depend 

on the hippocampus. Semantic memories ini-

tially depend heavily on the hippocampus, but 

increasingly depend on neocortex.
Multiple trace theory has received support 
from studies on healthy individuals as well as 

patients with retrograde amnesia. For example, 

Gilboa, Ramirez, Kohler, Westmacott, Black, 

and Moscovitch (2005) studied people™s personal 

recollections of recent and very old events 

going back several decades. Activation of the 

hippocampus was associated with the vividness

There is reasonable support for predictions 
following from multiple trace theory. First, 

the severity of retrograde amnesia in episodic 

memory is fairly strongly related to the amount 

of damage to the hippocampal complex, although 

frontal areas are also often damaged (Moscovitch 

et al., 2006). Second, damage to the hippocampal 

complex generally has less effect on semantic 

memory than on episodic memory, with any 
Alzheimer™s disease:
 a condition involving 
progressive loss of memory and mental abilities.

during various working-memory tasks, which 
raises the possibility that these regions of 

prefrontal cortex are involved in executive 

processing or cognitive control.
EPISODIC MEMORY
As we saw in Chapter 6, most episodic memories 

exhibit substantial and progressive forgetting 

over time. However, there are some exceptions. 

For example, Bahrick, Bahrick, and Wittlinger 

(1975) made use of photographs from high-

school yearbooks dating back many years. 

Ex-students showed remarkably little forgetting 

of information about their former classmates 

at retention intervals up to 25 years. Performance 

was 90% for recognising a name as being that 

of a classmate, for recognising a classmate™s 

photograph, and for matching a classmate™s 

name to his 
/ 
her school photograph. Performance 
remained very high on the last two tests even 

at a retention interval of almost 50 years, but 

performance on the name recognition task 

declined.
Bahrick, Hall, and Da Costa (2008) asked 
American ex-college students to recall their 

academic grades. Distortions in recall occurred 

shortly after graduation but thereafter remained  

fairly constant over retention intervals up to 

54 years. Perhaps not surprisingly, the great

Evaluation
There is convincing evidence for separate epi-

sodic and semantic memory systems. The relevant 

evidence is of various kinds, and includes studies 

of anterograde and retrograde amnesia as well 

as numerous neuroimaging studies.
It should be emphasised that the episodic 
and semantic memory systems typically 
combine
 
in their functioning. For example, suppose you 

retrieve an episodic memory of having an enjoy-

able 
picnic in the countryside. To do this, you 
need to retrieve semantic information about the 

concepts (e.g., picnic; grass) contained in your 

episodic memory. We have just seen that Prince 

et al. (2007) found evidence that some of the 

same brain regions are associated with episodic 

and semantic memory. In similar fashion, Nyberg  

et al. (2003) found that four regions of pre-

frontal cortex were activated during episodic 

and semantic memory tasks: left fronto-polar 

cortex, left mid-ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, 

left mid-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and 

dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. Nyberg et al. 

also found that the same areas were activated 
Bahrick et al. (1975) found 
that adults were remarkably  

good at recognising the 

photographs of those with 

whom they had been at 

school almost so years later.

task, in which participants indicate subjectively 

whether their positive recognition decisions were 

based on recollection of contextual information 

(remember responses) or solely on familiarity 

(know responses). The crucial issue here is 

deciding whether recollection and familiarity 

involve different processes Œ sceptics might argue 

that the only real difference is that strong memory  

traces give rise to recollection judgements and 

weak memory traces give rise to familiarity 

judgements. Dunn (2008) is one such sceptic. 

He carried out a meta-analysis of 37 studies 

using the rememberŒknow task, and found 

that the ˚ndings could be explained in terms 

of a single process based on memory strength. 

However, as we will see, there is much support 

for dual-process models.
We saw earlier that the medial temporal lobe  
and adjacent areas are of crucial importance 

in episodic memory. There is now reasonable 

support for a more precise account of the brain 

areas involved in recognition memory provided 

by the binding-of-item-and-context model (Diana 

et al., 2007) (see Figure 7.2):
Perirhinal cortex receives information 
(1) 
about speci˚ c items (ﬁwhatﬂ information 
needed for familiarity judgements).
Parahippocampal cortex receives informa-
(2) 
tion about context (ﬁwhereﬂ information

episodic memory), and binds them together

We turn now to a detailed consideration 
of how we can assess someone™s episodic memory.  

Recognition and recall are the two main types 

of episodic memory test. The basic recognition-

memory test involves presenting a series of 

items, with participants deciding whether each 

one was presented previously. As we will see, 

however, more complex forms of recognition-

memory test have also been used. There are 

three basic forms of recall test: free recall, serial 

recall, and cued recall. Free recall involves 

producing to-be-remembered items in any order 

in the absence of any speci˚
 c cues. Serial recall 
involves producing to-be-remembered items in 

the order in which they were presented originally. 

Cued recall involves producing to-be-remembered 

items in the presence of cues. For example, 

‚catŒtable™ might be presented at learning and 

the cue, ‚catŒ?™ might be given at test.
Recognition memory
Recognition memory can involve recollection 

or familiarity (e.g., Mandler, 1980). According 

to Diana, Yonelinas, and Ranganath (2007, 

p. 379), ﬁRecollection is the process of recog-

nising an item on the basis of the retrieval of 

speci˚
 c contextual details, whereas familiarity 
is the process of recognising an item on the 

basis of its perceived memory strength but 

without retrieval of any speci˚ c details about 

the study episode.ﬂ
We can clarify the distinction with the 
following anecdote. Several years ago, the ˚
 rst 
author walked past a man in Wimbledon, and 

was immediately con˚ dent that he recognised 

him. However, he simply could not think of 

the situation in which he had seen the man 

previously. After some thought (this is the kind

cessing is the most obvious requirement speci˚
 c 
to free recall.
Is episodic memory constructive?
We use episodic memory to remember past 

events that have happened to us. You might 

imagine that our episodic memory system would 

work like a video recorder, providing us with 

accurate and detailed information about past 

events. That is 
not
 the case. As Schacter and 

Addis (2007, p. 773) pointed out, ﬁEpisodic 

memory is . . . a fundamentally constructive, 

rather than reproductive process that is prone 

to various kinds of errors and illusions.ﬂ Plentiful 

evidence for this constructive view of episodic 

memory is discussed in other chapters. In 

Chapter 8, we discuss research showing how 

the constructive nature of episodic memory leads 

eyewitnesses to produce distorted memories of 

what they have seen. In Chapter 10, we discuss  

the in˜ uential views of Bartlett (1932). His 

central assumption was that the knowledge we 

possess can produce systematic distortions and 

errors in our episodic memories, an assumption  

that has been supported by much subsequent 

research.
Why
 are we saddled with an episodic memory 
system that is so prone to error? Schacter and 

Addis (2007) identi˚ed three reasons. First, it 

would require an incredible amount of processing 

to produce a semi-permanent record of all our 

experiences. Second, we generally want to access 

the gist or essence of our past experiences; thus, 

we want our memories to be

Recall memory
Some research on recall is discussed in Chapter 6.  

Here, we will focus on whether the processes 

involved in free recall are the same as those 

involved in recognition memory. In an impor-

tant study, Staresina and Davachi (2006) used 

three memory tests: free recall, item recognition 

(familiarity), and associative recognition (recol-

lection). Successful memory performance on 

all three tests was associated with increased 

activation in the left hippocampus and left 

ventrolateral prefrontal cortex at the time of 

encoding. This was most strongly the case with 

free recall and least strongly the case with item 

recognition. In addition, only successful sub-

sequent free recall was associated with increased 

activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex 

and posterior parietal cortex. The most likely 

explanation of this ˚ nding is that successful 

free recall involves forming associations (in this 

case between items and the colours in which they 

were studied), something that is not required 

for successful recognition memory.
What conclusions can we draw? First, the 
˚
 nding that similar brain areas are associated 
with successful free recall and recognition 

suggests that there are important similarities 

between the two types of memory test. Second,

constructive processes are required to imagine 

future events than to retrieve past events.
Evaluation
It has been assumed by many theorists, starting 

with Bartlett (1932), that episodic memory 

relies heavily on constructive processes, and 

there is convincing evidence to support that 

assumption (see Chapters 8 and 10). The further 

assumption by Schacter and Addis (2007) that 

the same constructive processes involved in 

episodic memory for past events are also involved 

in imaging the future is an exciting develop-

ment. The initial ˚ ndings from amnesic patients 

and functional neuroimaging studies are sup-

portive. However, further research is needed 

to clarify the reasons why there are higher levels 

of brain activation when individuals imagine 

future events than when they recall past events.
SEMANTIC MEMORY
Our organised general knowledge about the 

world is stored in semantic memory. The 

content of such knowledge can be extremely 

varied, including information about the French 

language, the rules of hockey, the names of 

capital cities, and the authors of famous books. 

How is information organised within semantic 

memory? Most is known about the organisation 

of 
concepts,
 which are mental representations 
of categories of objects or items. We will start 

by considering in˜ uential models focusing on 

the ways in which concepts are interconnected.  

After that, we will consider the storage of infor-

mation about concepts within the brain.
to us for various reasons (e.g., forming plans 

for the future). Perhaps the constructive pro-

cesses involved in episodic memory are also 

used to imagine the future.
Evidence
We typically remember the gist of what we 

have experienced previously, and our tendency 

to"
Segment_465,"remember gist increases with age. Consider   a study by Brainerd and Mojardin (1998).   Children aged 6, 8, and 11 listened to sets of   three sentences (e.g., ﬁThe coffee is hotter than   the teaﬂ; ﬁThe tea is hotter than the cocoaﬂ;   ﬁThe cocoa is hotter than the soupﬂ). On the   subsequent reco",Explores how emotion influences cognition.,"emotion, awareness, perception",Nested under Chapter on emotion,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in perception,Aligned with contemporary studies on perception,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_1309," remember gist increases with age. Consider 

a study by Brainerd and Mojardin (1998). 

Children aged 6, 8, and 11 listened to sets of 

three sentences (e.g., ﬁThe coffee is hotter than 

the teaﬂ; ﬁThe tea is hotter than the cocoaﬂ; 

ﬁThe cocoa is hotter than the soupﬂ). On the 

subsequent recognition test, participants decided 

whether the test sentences had been presented 

initially in precisely that form. The key condition 

was one in which sentences having the same 

meaning as original sentences were presented 

(e.g., ﬁThe cocoa is cooler than the teaﬂ). False 

recognition on these sentences increased steadily 

with age.
We turn now to the hypothesis that imagin-
ing future events involves the same processes 

as those involved in remembering past events. 

On that hypothesis, individuals with very poor 

episodic memory (e.g., amnesic patients) should 

also have impaired ability to imagine future 

events. Hassabis, Kumaran, Vann, and Maguire  

(2007) asked amnesic patients and healthy 

controls to imagine future events (e.g., ﬁImagine 

you are lying on a white sandy beach in a 

beautiful tropical bayﬂ). The 
amnesic patients  

produced imaginary experiences 
consisting of 
isolated fragments of information lacking 

the richness and spatial coherence of the 

experiences imagined by the controls.
Addis, Wong, and Schacter (2007) com-
pared brain activity when individuals generated 

past and future events and then elaborated on 

them. There was considerable overlap in patterns 

of brain activity during the elaboration phase. 

The areas activated during elaboration of past 

and future events included the left anterior 

temporal cortex (associated with conceptual 

and semantic information about one™s life) and 

the left frontopolar cortex (associated with self-

referential processing). There was some overlap 
concepts:
 mental representations of categories 
of objects or items.

hierarchy. In contrast, the sentence, ﬁA canary 
can ˜ yﬂ, should take longer because the con-

cept and property are separated by one level 

in the hierarchy. The sentence, ﬁA canary has 

skinﬂ, should take even longer because two 

levels separate the concept and the property. 

As predicted, the time taken to respond to true 

sentences became progressively slower as the 

separation between the subject of the sentence 

and the property became greater.
The model is right in its claim that we often 
use semantic memory successfully by 
inferring
 

the right answer. For example, the information 

that Leonardo da Vinci had knees is not stored 

directly in semantic memory. However, we 

know Leonardo da Vinci was a human being, 

and that human beings have knees, and so we 

con˚
 dently infer that Leonardo da Vinci had 
knees. This is the kind of inferential process 

proposed by Collins and Quillian (1969).
In spite of its successes, the model suffers 
from various problems. A sentence such as, ﬁA 

canary is yellowﬂ, differs from, ﬁA canary has 

skinﬂ, not only in the hierarchical distance 

between the concept and its property, but also 

in familiarity. Indeed, you have probably never 

encountered the sentence, ﬁA canary has skinﬂ, 

in your life before! Conrad (1972) found that 

hierarchical distance between the subject and 

the property had little effect on veri˚
 cation 
time when familiarity was controlled.
Network models
We can answer numerous simple questions about 

semantic memory very rapidly. For example, 

it takes about one second to decide a sparrow 

is a bird, or to think of a fruit starting with p. 

This great ef˚ ciency suggests that semantic 

memory is highly organised or structured.
The ˚ rst systematic model of semantic 
memory was put forward by Collins and Quillian 

(1969). Their key assumption was that semantic 

memory is"
Segment_467,"organised into hierarchical networks   (see Figure 7.4). The major concepts (e.g.,   animal, bird, canary) are represented as nodes,   and properties or features (e.g., has wings; is   yellow) are associated with each concept.

(see Figure 7.4). The major concepts (e.g., 

animal, bird, canary) are represented as nodes, 

and properties or features (e.g., has wings; is 

yellow) are associated with each concept. You 

may wonder why the property ﬁcan ˜ yﬂ is stored 

with the bird concept rather than with the 

canary concept. According to Collins and 

Quillian, those properties possessed by nearly 

all birds (e.g., can ˜ y; has wings) are stored only 

at the bird node or concept. The underlying 

principle is one of cognitive economy: property 

information is stored as high up the hierarchy 

as possible to minimise the amount of informa-

tion stored.
According to the model of Collins and 
Quillian (1969), it should be possible to decide 

very rapidly that the sentence, ﬁA canary is 

yellowﬂ, is true because the concept (i.e., 

ﬁcanaryﬂ) and the property (i.e., ﬁis yellowﬂ) 

are stored together at the same level of the

ostriches are less typical birds than eagles, 
which in turn are less typical than robins.
What does this tell us about the structure 
of semantic memory? It strongly implies that 

Collins and Quillian (1969) were mistaken in 

assuming that the concepts we use belong to 

rigidly de˚
 ned categories. Convincing evidence 
that many concepts in semantic memory are 

fuzzy rather than neat and tidy was reported 

by McCloskey and Glucksberg (1978). They 

gave 30 people tricky questions such as, ﬁIs a

but 14 said it was not. A pumpkin was regarded 

as a fruit by 16 participants but not as a fruit 

by the remainder. More surprisingly, when 

McCloskey and Glucksberg tested the same 

participants a month later, 11 of them had 

changed their minds about ﬁstrokeﬂ being a 

disease, and eight had altered their opinion 

about ﬁpumpkinﬂ being a fruit!
Collins and Loftus (1975) put forward a 
spreading activation theory. They argued that 
There is another limitation. Consider the 
following statements: ﬁA canary is a birdﬂ and 

ﬁA penguin is a birdﬂ. On their theory, both 

statements should take the same length of time 

to verify, because they both involve moving 

one level in the hierarchy. In fact, however, it 

takes longer to decide that a penguin is a bird. 

Why is that so? The members of most categories 

vary considerably in terms of how typical or 

representative they are of the category to which 

they belong. For example, Rosch and Mervis 

(1975) found that oranges, apples, bananas, 

and peaches were rated as much more typical 

fruits than olives, tomatoes, coconuts, and dates. 

Rips, Shoben, and Smith (1973) found that 

veri˚
cation times were faster for more typical 
or representative members of a category than 

for relatively atypical members (the 
typicality 

effect
).
More typical members of a category possess 
more of the characteristics associated with that 

category than less typical ones. Rosch (1973) 

produced a series of sentences containing the 

word ﬁbirdﬂ. Sample sentences were as follows: 

ﬁBirds eat wormsﬂ; ﬁI hear a bird singingﬂ; 

ﬁI watched a bird ˜ y over the houseﬂ; and ﬁThe

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
According to spreading activation theory, 
whenever a person sees, hears, or thinks about 
a concept, the appropriate node in semantic 

memory is activated. This activation then spreads 

most strongly to other concepts closely related 

semantically, and more weakly to those more 

distant semantically. For example, activation 

would pass strongly and rapidly from ﬁrobinﬂ 

to ﬁbirdﬂ in the sentence, ﬁA robin is a birdﬂ, 

because ﬁrobinﬂ and ﬁbirdﬂ are closely related 

semantically. However, it would pass more 

weakly and slowly from ﬁpenguinﬂ to ﬁbirdﬂ 

in the sentence, ﬁA penguin is a birdﬂ. As a 

result, the model predicts the typicality effect.
Other predictions of the spreading activa-
tion model have been tested experimentally. 

For example, Meyer and Schvaneveldt (1976) 
the notion of logically organised hierarchies 

was too in˜ exible. They assumed instead that 

semantic memory is organised on the basis 

of semantic relatedness or semantic distance. 

Semantic relatedness can be measured by asking 

people to decide how closely related pairs of 

words are. Alternatively, people can list as many  

members as they can of a particular category. 

Those members produced most often are regarded 

as most closely related to the category.

It is often assumed (e.g., Bartlett, 1932; Bransford,  
1979) that we have schemas (organised packets 

of knowledge) stored in semantic memory. For 

example, our schematic knowledge leads us to 

expect that most kitchens will have an oven, 

a refrigerator, a sink, cupboards, and so on. 

What is known about the organisation of 

schematic knowledge in the brain is discussed 

in Chapter 10.
In this section, we focus on our semantic 
knowledge of concepts and objects. How is 

that knowledge organised in the brain? One 

obvious possibility is that all information we 

possess about any given object or concept is 

stored in 
one
 location in the brain. Another 

possibility is that different kinds of information 

(features) about a given object are stored in 

different locations in the brain. This notion is 

incorporated in feature-based theories. According 

to such theories, ﬁObject concepts may be 

represented in the brain as distributed networks 

of activity in the areas involved in the processing 

of perceptual or functional knowledgeﬂ (Canessa 

e"
Segment_471,"t al., 2008, p. 740). As we will see, both of   these possibilities capture part of what is actually   the case. PerceptualŒfunctional theories An in˜ uential feature-based approach was put   forward by Warrington and Shallice (1984) and   Farah and McClelland (1991).

As we will see, both of 

these possibilities capture part of what is actually 

the case.
PerceptualŒfunctional theories
An in˜ uential feature-based approach was put 

forward by Warrington and Shallice (1984) and 

Farah and McClelland (1991). According to 

this approach, there is an important distinction  

between visual or perceptual features (e.g., 

what does the object look 
like?) and functional 

features (e.g., what is the object used for?). 

Our semantic knowledge of living things is 

mostly based on perceptual information. In 

contrast, our knowledge of non-living things (e.g., 

tools) mainly involves functional information.
had participants decide as rapidly as possible 

whether a string of letters formed a word. In 

the key condition, a given word (e.g., ﬁbutterﬂ) 

was immediately preceded by a semantically 

related word (e.g., ﬁbreadﬂ) or by an unrelated 

word (e.g., ﬁnurseﬂ). According to the model, 

activation should have spread from the ˚
 rstword 
to the second only when they were semantically 

related and this activation should have made 

it easier to identify the second word. Thus, 

ﬁbutterﬂ should have been identi˚
 ed as a word 
faster when preceded by ﬁbreadﬂ than by ﬁnurseﬂ. 

Indeed, there was a facilitation (or semantic 

priming) effect for semantically related words.
McNamara (1992) used the same basic 
approach as Meyer and Schvaneveldt (1976). 

Suppose the ˚ rst word was ﬁredﬂ. This was 

sometimes followed by a word one link away 

(e.g., ﬁrosesﬂ), and sometimes by a word two 

links away (e.g., ﬁ˜ owersﬂ). More activation 

should spread from the activated word to 

words one link away than those two links 

away, and so the facilitation effect should have 

been greater in the former case. That is what 

McNamara (1992) found.
Schacter, Alpert, Savage, Rauch, and Albert 
(1996) used the DeeseŒRoedigerŒMcDermott 

paradigm described in 
Chapter 6. Participants 

received word lists 
constructed "
Segment_472,"in a particular   way. An initial word (e.g., ﬁdoctorﬂ) was selected,   and then several words closely associated with   it (e.g., ﬁnurseﬂ, ﬁsickﬂ, ﬁhospitalﬂ, ﬁpatientﬂ)   were selected. All these words (excluding the   initial word) were presented for learning,   followed by a test of recognition",Explores how perception influences cognition.,"perception, emotion, recognition",Nested under Chapter on emotion,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in recognition,Aligned with contemporary studies on recognition,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_306,"in a particular 

way. An initial word (e.g., ﬁdoctorﬂ) was selected, 

and then several words closely associated with 

it (e.g., ﬁnurseﬂ, ﬁsickﬂ, ﬁhospitalﬂ, ﬁpatientﬂ) 

were selected. All these words (excluding the 

initial word) were presented for learning, 

followed by a test of recognition memory. When 

the initial word was presented on the recognition 

test, it should theoretically have been highly 

activated because it was so closely related to 

all the list words. Schacter et al. compared 

brain activation on the recognition test when 

participants falsely recognised the initial word 

and when they correctly recognised list words. 

The pattern and intensity of brain activation 

were very similar in both cases, indicating that 

there was substantial activation of the initial 

word, as predicted by the model.
The spreading activation model has generally 
proved more successful than the hierarchical

from 44 patients. Of the 38 patients having a 
selective impairment for knowledge of living 

things, nearly all had damage to the anterior, 

medial, and inferior parts of the temporal lobes. 

In contrast, the six patients having a selective 

impairment for knowledge of man-made objects 

had damage in fronto-parietal areas extending 

further back in the brain than the areas damaged 

in the other group.
Support for perceptualŒfunctional theories 
has also come from neuroimaging studies. 
Lee, 
Graham, Simons, Hodges, Owen, and Patterson 

(2002) asked healthy participants to retrieve 

perceptual or non-perceptual informa
tion about 
living or non-living objects or concepts 
when 
presented with their names. Processing of per-

ceptual information from both living and non-

living objects was associated with activation

activation of left posterior inferior temporal 

lobe regions. Comparisons between living and

both
 types 
of con-

cept. Thus, what determi
ned which 
brain areas 
were activated was whether per
ceptual o r  
non-
perceptual information was being 
processed.
Similar ˚ ndings were reported by Marques, 
Canessa, Siri, Catricala, and Cappa (2008). Parti-

cipants were presented with 
statements about 

the features (e.g., form, 
colour, size, motion) 

of living and non-living objects, 
and patterns  

of brain activity were assessed while 
they decided  
whether the statements were true 
or false. Their 
˚
 ndings largely agreed with those of Lee et al. 
(2002): ﬁThe results . . . highlighted that feature 

type rather than concept domain [living versus 

non-living] is the main organ isational factor 

of the brain representation of conceptual know-

ledgeﬂ (Marques et al., 2008, p. 95).
An additional assumption of the perceptualŒ
functional approach is that semantic memory 

contains far more information about perceptual  

properties of objects than of functional proper-

ties. Farah and McClelland (1991) examined 

the descriptors of living and non-living objects 

given in the dictionary. Three times more of 

the descriptors were classi˚ ed as visual than 

as functional. As predicted, the ratio of visual 

to functional descriptors was 7.7:1 for living 

objects but only 1.4:1 for non-living objects.
Two major predictions follow from the 
perceptualŒfunctional approach. First, brain 

damage should generally impair knowledge of 

living things more than non-living things. Brain 

damage is likely to destroy more information 

about perceptual features than functional features  

because more such information is stored in the 

˚
 rst place. Second, neuroimaging should reveal 
that different brain areas"
Segment_474,are activated when   perceptual features of an object are processed   than functional features. We turn now to a consideration of the  relevant evidence. Some research has focused   on brain-damaged patients who have problems   with semantic memory and other research   has used neuroimaging while h,Explores how awareness influences cognition.,"emotion, perception, awareness",Nested under Chapter on memory,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in attention,Aligned with contemporary studies on memory,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_771," are activated when

than functional features.
We turn now to a consideration of the 
relevant evidence. Some research has focused 

on brain-damaged patients who have problems 

with semantic memory and other research 

has used neuroimaging while healthy particip -

ants engage in tasks that involve semantic 

memory.
Evidence
Many brain-damaged patients exhibit 
category-

speci˚ c de˚ cits,
 meaning they have problems 

with speci˚
 c categories of object. For example, 
Warrington and Shallice (1984) studied a patient 

(JBR). He had much greater dif˚culty in iden-

tifying pictures of living than of non-living 

things (success rates of 6% and 90%, respec-

tively). This pattern is common. Martin and 

Caramazza (2003) reviewed the evidence. More 

than 100 patients with a category-speci˚
 c de˚ cit 
for living but not for non-living things have 

been studied compared to approximately 25 with 

the opposite pattern. These ˚
 ndings are as 
predicted by perceptualŒfunctional theories.
Why do some patients show greater impair-
ment in recognising non-living than living 

things? Gainotti (2000) reviewed the evidence 
category-speci˚
 c de˚ cits:
 disorders caused 
by brain damage in which 
semantic

is disrupted for certain semantic categories.

larities among fruits, vegetables, and foods 

because sensory features associated with taste 

are important to all three categories.
Cree and McRae (2003) identi˚
 ed seven 
different patterns of category-speci˚
 c de˚ cits 
occurring following brain damage (see Table 7.1). 

They pointed out that no previous theory could 

account for all these patterns. 
However, 
their 
multiple-feature approach can do 
so. 
When

The multiple-property approach is promising 
for various reasons. First, it is based on a 

recognition that most concepts consist of several 

properties and that these properties determine 

similarities and differences among them. Second, 

the approach provides a reasonable account of 

several different patterns of de˚ cit in conceptual 

knowledge observed in brain-damaged patients. 

Third, it is consistent with brain-imaging ˚
 ndings 
suggesting that different object properties are 

stored in different parts of the brain (e.g., Martin 

& Chao, 2001).
Distributed-plus-hub theory vs. 
grounded cognition
As we have seen, there is general agreement 
that much of our knowledge of objects and 

concepts is widely distributed in the brain. Such 

knowledge is modality-speci˚ c (e.g., visual or 

auditory) and relates to perception, language, 

and action. This knowledge is probably stored 

in brain regions overlapping with those involved 

in perceiving, using language, and acting.
Does semantic memory also contain rela-
tively abstract amodal representations not 

associated directly with any of the sensory 
Multiple-property approach
The ˚ ndings discussed so far are mostly con-

sistent with perceptualŒfunctional theories. 

However, there is increasing evidence that such 

theories are oversimpli˚ ed. For example, many 

properties of living things (e.g., carnivore; lives 

in the desert) do not seem to be sensory or 

functional. In addition, the de˚ nition of func-

tional feature has often been very broad and 

included an object™s uses as well as how it is 

manipulated. Buxbaum and Saffran (2002) have 

shown the importance of distinguishing between 

these two kinds of knowledge. Some of the 

patients they studied suffered from

In contrast, non-apraxic patients with damage 

to the temporal lobe showed the opposite pattern. 

Functional knowledge should probably be 

divided into ﬁwhat forﬂ and ﬁhowﬂ knowledge 

(Canessa et al., 2008).
Canessa et al. (2008) reported functional 
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI; see Glossary) 

˚
 ndings supporting the above distinction. Healthy  
participants were presented with pictures of pairs  

of objects on each trial. They decided whether 

the objects were used in the same context (func-

tional or ﬁwhat forﬂ knowledge) or involved the 

same manipulation pattern (action or ﬁhowﬂ 

knowledge). Processing action knowledge led 

to activation in a left frontoparietal network, 

whereas processing functional knowledge act-

ivated areas within the lateral anterior infero-

temporal cortex. The areas associated with these 

two kinds of knowledge were generally con-

sistent with those identi˚ ed by Buxbaum and 

Saffran (2002) in brain-damaged patients.
Cree and McRae (2003) showed that the 
distinction between perceptual and functional 

properties of objects is oversimpli˚
 ed. They 
argued that functional features should be 

divided into entity behaviours (what a thing 

does) and functional information (what humans 

use it for). Perceptual properties should be 

divided into visual (including colour), auditory,

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
Evidence
As predicted by theories of grounded cognition,  
modality-speci˚
 c information is very important 
in our processing of concepts. Consider a study 

by Hauk, Johnsrude, and Pulvermüller (2004). 

Tongue, ˚ nger, and foot movements "
Segment_477,"produced   different patterns of activation along the motor   strip. When they presented participants with   words such as ﬁlickﬂ, ﬁpickﬂ, and ﬁkickﬂ, these   verbs activated parts of the motor strip over-  lapping with (or very close to) the correspond-  ing part of the motor strip.

different patterns of activation along the motor 

strip. When they presented participants with 

words such as ﬁlickﬂ, ﬁpickﬂ, and ﬁkickﬂ, these 

verbs activated parts of the motor strip over-

lapping with (or very close to) the correspond-

ing part of the motor strip. Thus, for example, 

the word ﬁlickﬂ activated areas associated with 

tongue movements.
The ˚ ndings of Hauk et al. (2004) show 
that the motor system is 
associated 
with the 
processing of action words. However, these 

˚
 ndings do not necessarily mean that the motor 
and premotor cortex 
inß uence
 the processing 

of action words. More convincing evidence 

was reported by Pulvermüller, Hauk, Nikulin, 

and Ilmoniemi (2005). Participants performed 

a lexical decision task in which they decided 

whether strings of letters formed words. Different  

parts of the motor system were stimulated with 

transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS; see 

Glossary) while this task was performed. The 

key conditions were those in which arm-related 

or leg-related words were presented while TMS 

was applied to parts of the left-hemisphere 
modalities? There has been much recent con-

troversy on this issue. Barsalou (2008) argued 

that the answer is, ﬁNoﬂ. He argued in favour 

of theories of grounded cognition which, ﬁreject 

the standard view that amodal symbols represent 

knowledge in semantic memory . . . [they] focus 

on the roles of simulation in cognition.  .  .  .  Simulation 

is the re-enactment of perceptual, motor, and 

introspective states acquired during experience 

(p. 618).
According to the distributed-plus-hub theory 
(Patterson et al., 2007; Rogers et al., 2004), 

the answer is, ﬁYesﬂ. There is a hub for each 

concept or object in addition to distributed 

modality-speci˚
 c information. Each hub is a 
uni˚
 ed conceptual representation that ﬁsupports

resentations in all modalitiesﬂ (Patterson et al.,

concrete concepts or objects that we can see 
and interact with. On the face of it, the 

approach seems less useful when applied to 

abstract concepts such as ﬁtruthﬂ, ﬁfreedomﬂ, 

and ﬁinventionﬂ. However, Barsalou and Wiemer-

Hastings (2005) argued that abstract concepts 

can potentially be understood within the grounded  

cognition approach. Participants indicated the 

characteristic properties of various abstract 

concepts. Many properties referred to settings 

or events associated with the concept (e.g., 

scientists working in a labor"
Segment_479,"atory for ﬁinven-  tionﬂ), and others referred to relevant mental   states. Thus, much of the knowledge we have   of abstract concepts is relatively concrete.

According to the distributed-plus-hub theory,

ments. 
There was a facilitation effect: arm-related 
words were processed faster when TMS was 

applied to the arm site than to the leg site, and 

the opposite was the case with leg-related words  

(see Figure 7.6).
Evidence that perceptual information is 
involved in our use of concepts was reported 

by Solomon and Barsalou (2001). Participants 

decided whether concepts possessed certain 

properties. The key issue was whether veri˚
 ca-
tion times would be speeded up when the same 

property was linked to two different concepts. 

There was a facilitation effect 
only
 when the 

shape of the property was similar in both cases, 

indicating that perceptual information in˜
 uenced 
task performance. For example, verifying that 

ﬁmaneﬂ is a property of ﬁponyﬂ was facilitated 

by previously verifying ﬁmaneﬂ for ﬁhorseﬂ but 

not by verifying ﬁmaneﬂ for ﬁlionﬂ.

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
Evaluation
Much progress has been made in understanding  
the organisation of semantic memory (see also 

Chapter 10). The distributed-plus-hub theory 

provides a more comprehensive account of 

semantic memory than previous theories. The 

evidence from brain-damaged patients with  

category-speci˚
 c de˚
 cits indicates that different  
object properties are stored in different brain 

areas. In addition, patients with semantic demen-

tia 
provide evidence for the existence of concept 
hubs stored in the anterior temporal lobes.
What are the limitations of distributed-plus-
hub theory? First, more remains to be discovered 

about the information contained within concept 

hubs. For example, is more information stored 

in the hubs of very familiar concepts than of 

less familiar ones? Second, how do we combine 

or integrate concept hub information with 

distributed modality-speci˚ c information? It 

would seem that complex processes are probably 

involved, but we do not as yet have a clear sense 

of how these processes operate.
NON-DECLARATIVE 
MEMORY
The essence of non-declarative memory is that 
it does not involve conscious recollection but 

instead reveals itself through behaviour. As 

discussed earlier, repetition priming (facilitated 

processing of repeated stimuli) and procedural 

memory (mainly skill learning) are two of the 

major types of non-declarative memory. There 

are several differences between repetition priming 

and procedural memory. First, priming often 

occurs rapidly, whereas procedural memory 

or skill learning is typically slow and gradual 
would be poor regardless of the modality of 

input"
Segment_481,"(e.g., objects; words; sounds) and the   modality of output (e.g., object naming; object   drawing). The above predictions have been tested  using patients with semantic dementia.

modality of output (e.g., object naming; object 

drawing).
The above predictions have been tested 
using patients with semantic dementia. 
Semantic 
dementia
 involves loss of concept knowledge 

even though most cognitive functions are rea-

sonably intact early in the disease. It always 

involves degeneration of the anterior temporal 

lobes. As predicted by the distributed-plus-hub 

theory, patients with semantic dementia perform 

very poorly on tests of semantic memory across 

all semantic categories regardless of the modal-

ities of input and output (see Patterson et al., 

2007, for a review). Patients with semantic 

dementia are unable to name objects when 

relevant pictures are presented or when they 

are given a description of the object (e.g., ﬁWhat 

do we call the African animal with black and 

white stripes?ﬂ). They are also unable to identify 

objects when listening to their characteristic 

sounds (e.g., a phone ringing; a dog barking).
Theoretically, we would expect functional 
neuroimaging studies to indicate strong activa-

tion in the anterior temporal lobes when healthy 

participants perform semantic memory tasks. 

In fact, most studies have found no evidence 

for such activation! Rogers et al. (2006) identi-

non-words presented in a mirror 
were read as 
fast as possible. Activity in different 
areas of 
the brain was assessed by fMRI. The ˚
 ndings 
were reasonably clear-cut:
[Skill] learning . . . was associated with 

increased activation in left inferior temporal, 

striatal, left inferior prefrontal and right 

cerebellar regions and 
with decreased 
activity in the left hippocampus and left 

cerebellum. Short-term repetition priming 

was associated with reduced activity in 

many of the regions active during mirror 

reading 
and . . . long-term repetition priming  
resulted in a virtual elimination of 

activity in those regions. (p. 67)
The ˚ nding that very similar areas were 

involved in skill learning and priming is con-

sistent with the hypothesis that they involve 

the same underlying memory system. However,
 
evidence less supportive of that hypothesis is 

discussed later.
Repetition priming
We can draw a distinction between perceptual 

priming and conceptual priming. 
Perceptual 

priming
 occurs when repeated presentation of 

a stimulus leads to facilitated processing of its 

perceptual features. For example, it is easier t o  

identify a word presented in a degraded 
fashion 

if it has recently been encountered. In contrast, 

conceptual priming
 occurs when repeated pre-

sentation of a stimulus leads to 
facilitated pro-

cessing of its meaning. For example,  
people can 
decide faster whether a"

(Knowlton & Foerde, 2008). Second, there is 

stimulus speci˚ city. Priming is tied to speci˚
 c 
stimuli whereas skill learning typically genera-

lises to numerous stimuli. For example, it would  

not be much use if you learned how to hit 

backhands at tennis very well, but could only 

do so provided that the ball came towards you 

from a given direction at a given speed! Third, 

there is increasing evidence that different brain 

areas are involved in repetition priming and 

skill learning (Knowlton & Foerde, 2008).
If repetition priming and skill learning 
involve different memory systems, then there 

is no particular reason why individuals who 

are good at skill learning should be good at 

priming. There is often practically no correlation 

between performance on these two types of 

task. Schwartz and Hashtroudi (1991) used 

a word-identi˚ cation task to assess priming 

and an inverted-text reading task to assess skill 

learning. There was no correlation between 

priming and skill learning. However, the inter-

pretation of such ˚ ndings is open to dispute. 

Gupta and Cohen (2002) developed a compu-

tational model based on the assumption that 

skill learning and priming depend on a 
single
 

mechanism. This model accounted for zero 

correlations between skill learning and priming.
It is probable that priming and skill learning 
involve separate memory systems. However, 

most of the evidence is not clear-cut because 

the tasks assessing skill learning and repetition 

priming have been very different. This led 

Poldrack, Selco, Field, and Cohen (1999) to 

compare skill learning and priming within a
 

single
 task. Participants entered ˚
 ve-digit 
numbers as rapidly as possible into a computer 

keypad. Priming was assessed by 
performance  
on repeated digit strings, whereas

patients were presented with a 
list of words 
followed by a priming task. This task was per-

ceptual identi˚ cation, and involved presenting 

the words at the minimal exposure time needed 

t o identify them. The performance of the amnesic 

patients resembled that of control participants, 

with identi˚ cation times being faster for the 

primed list words than for the unprimed ones. 

Thus, the amnesic patients showed as great a 

perceptual priming effect as the controls. Cermak  

et al. also used a 
conventional test of recognition 
memory 
(involving episodic memory) for the 
list words. The amnesic patients did signi˚
 cantly 
worse than the controls on this task.
Graf, Squire, and Mandler (1984) studied 
a different perceptual priming effect. Word lists 

were presented, with the participants deciding 

how much they liked each word. The lists were 

followed by one of four memory tests. Three 

tests involved declarative memory (free recall, 

recognition memory, and cued recall), but the 

fourth test (word completion) involved priming. 

On this last test, participants were given three-

letter word fragments (e.g., STR ____) and 

simply wrote down the ˚
 rst word they thought 
of starting with those letters (e.g., STRA"
Segment_485,"P;   STRIP). Priming was assessed by the extent   to which the word completion corresponded   to words from the list previously presented.   Amnesic patients did much worse than controls   on all the declarative memory tests, but the   groups did not differ on the word-completion   test.

to which the word completion corresponded 

to words from the list previously presented. 

Amnesic patients did much worse than controls 

on all the declarative memory tests, but the 

groups did not differ on the word-completion 

test.
Levy, Stark, and Squire (2004) studied 
conceptual priming and recognition memory 

(involving declarative memory) in amnesic 

patients with large lesions in the medial 

temporal lobe, amnesic patients with lesions 

limited to the hippocampus, and healthy con-

trols. The conceptual priming task involved 

deciding whether words previously studied or 

not studied belonged to given categories. The 

˚
 ndings were striking. All three groups showed 
very similar amounts of conceptual priming. 

However, both amnesic groups performed poorly 

on recognition memory (see Figure 7.7). Indeed, 

the amnesic patients with large lesions showed 

no evidence of any declarative memory at all.
Much evidence supports the distinction 
between perceptual and conceptual priming. 

Keane, Gabrieli, Mapstone, Johnson, and Corkin 

(1995) studied perceptual and conceptual priming 

in LH, a patient with bilateral brain damage 

within the occipital lobes. LH had an absence 

of perceptual priming but intact conceptual 

priming. In contrast, patients with Alzheimer™s 

disease have the opposite pattern of intact per-

ceptual priming but impaired conceptual priming  

(see Keane et al., 1995, for a review). According 

to Keane et al., the impaired conceptual prim-

ing shown by Alzheimer™s patients is due to 

damage within the temporal and parietal lobes. 

The ˚ ndings suggest the existence of a double 

dissociation (see Glossary), which provides 

reasonable support that different processes 

underlie the two types of priming.

Evaluation
There are important similarities and differences 

between perceptual and conceptual priming. 

They are similar in that most amnesic patients 

typically show essentially intact perceptual and 

conceptual priming, suggesting that both types 

of priming involve non-declarative memory. 

However, the ˚ nding of a double dissociation 

in which some patients are much better at 

perceptual than at conceptual priming, whereas 

others show the opposite pattern, suggests there

The consistent ˚ nding that repetition priming 

is associated with reduced brain activation 

suggests that people become more ef˚
 cient at 
processing repeated stimuli. Recent research 

has supported the hypothesis that there is a 

causal link between patterns of brain activation 

and priming performance.
Future research needs to establish more 
clearly that reduced brain activation during 

repetition priming is causally related to enhanced 

priming. There is also a need to identify more 

precisely the different processes involved in 

perceptual and conceptual priming.
Procedural memory or 
skill learning
What exactly is skill learning? According to 
Poldrack et al. (1999, p. 208), ﬁSkill learning 

refers to the gradual improvement of perform-

ance with practice that generalises to a range 

of stimuli within a domain of processing.ﬂ 

Motor skills are important in everyday life. 

For example, they are needed in word processing, 

writing, and playing a musical instrument.
Foerde and Poldrack (2009) identi˚
 ed 
numerous types of skill learning or procedural 
initially presented in 
six
 different voices. On 

the word-identi˚ cation test, half the words were 

presented in the same voice and half were spoken 

by one of the other voices (re-paired condition).  

The healthy controls showed 
more 
priming for 
words presented in the same 
voice, but the 
amnesic patients did not (see Figure 7.8b).
How can we explain the above ˚
 ndings? 
In both the same voice and re-paired voice 

conditions, the participants were exposed to 

words and voices they had heard before. The 

only advantage in the same voice condition was 

that the pairing of word and voice was the same  

as before. However, only those participants 

who had linked or associated words and voices 

at the original presentation would bene˚

that fact. The implication is that amnesics

What processes are involved in priming? 
One popular view is based on perceptual ˜
 uency: 
repeated presentation of a stimulus means it 

can be processed more ef˚ ciently using fewer 

resources. It follows from this view that priming 

should be associated with 
reduced
 levels of 

brain activity (known as neural priming). There 

is considerable evidence for this prediction 

(e.g., Poldrack & Gabrieli, 2001). The precise 

brain regions showing reduced activation vary 

somewhat depending on the task and whether 

perceptual or conceptual priming is being studied. 

Early visual areas in the occipital lobe often 

show reduced activity with perceptual priming, 

whereas the inferior frontal gyrus and left in-

ferior temporal cortex show reduced activity 

with conceptual priming (see Schacter et al., 

2007, for a review).
The ˚ nding that repetition of a stimulus 
causes priming and reduced brain activity does 

not show there is a 
causal
 link between patterns 

of brain activation and priming. More direct 

evidence was reported by Wig, Grafton, Demos, 

and Kelley (2005). They studied conceptual 

priming using a task in which participants 

classi˚
 ed objects as living or nonliving. Wig 
et al. tested the involvement of the left inferior

procedural and declarative memory on the 

probabilistic classi˚ cation task seemed to depend 

on the precise conditions under which the task 

was performed.
Evidence
Amnesics often have normal (or nearly normal) 

rates of skill learning across numerous tasks.

Corkin (1968) reported that the amnesic 
patient HM (see p. 252) was able to learn mirror 

drawing, in which the pen used in drawing a 

˚
 gure is observed in a mirror rather than directly. 
He also showed learning on the pursuit rotor, 

which involves manual tracking of a moving 

target. HM™s rate of learning was slower than that 

of healthy individuals on the pursuit rotor. In 

contrast, Cermak, Lewis, Butters, and Goodglass 

(1973) found that amnesic patients learned the 

pursuit rotor as rapidly as healthy participants. 

However, the amnesic patients were slower than 

healthy individuals at learning a ˚
 nger maze.
Tranel, Damasio, Damasio, and Brandt 
(1994) found in a study on 28 amnesic patients 

that all showed comparable learning on the 

pursuit rotor to healthy controls. Of particular 

note was a patient, Boswell, who had unusually 

extensive brain damage to areas (e.g., medial 

and lateral temporal lobes) strongly associated 

with declarative memory. In spite of this, his 

learning on the pursuit rotor and retention over 

a two-year period were both at the same level 

as healthy controls.
The typical form of the serial reaction time 
task involves presenting visual targets in one of  

four horizontal locations, with the participants 

pressing the closest key as rapidly as possible 

(see Chapter 6). The sequence of targets is 

sometimes repeated over 10 or 12 trials, and skill 

learning is shown by improved performance 

on these repeated sequences. Nissen, Willingham,

the above tasks involve non-declarative or pro-

cedural memory, and thus involve different 

memory systems from those underlying episodic 

and semantic memory. This issue has been 

addressed in various ways. However, we will 

mostly consider research on skill learning in 

amnesic patients. The rationale for doing this 

is simple: if amnesic patients have essentially 

intact skill learning but severely impaired 

declarative memory that would provide evidence 

that different memory systems are involved.
We will shortly turn to the relevant evidence.  
Before doing so, however, we need to consider 

an important issue. It is easy to imagine that 

some tasks involve only non-declarative or 

procedural memory, whereas others involve 

declarative memory. In fact, matters are rarely 

that simple (see Chapter 6). For example, 

consider the probabilistic classi˚
 cation task. 
Participants predict whether the weather will 

be sunny or rainy on the basis of various cues. 

Reber, Knowlton, and Squire (1996) found that 

amnesics learned this task as rapidly as healthy 

controls, suggesting that the task involves 

procedural memory.
Foerde, Knowlton, and Poldrack (2006) 
obtained evidence suggesting that learning on 

the probabilistic classi˚ cation task can depend 

on either procedural or declarative memory. 

Participants performed the task on its own or 

with a demanding secondary task. Performance 

was similar in the two conditions. However, 

important differences emerged between the 

conditions when the fMRI data were considered. 

Task performance in the dual-task condition 

correlated with activity in the striatum (part of 

the basal ganglia), a part of the brain associated 

with procedural learning and memory. In 

contrast, task performance in the single-task 

performance correlated with activity in the 

medial temporal lobe, an area associated with

in spite of very poor declarative memory. That 
provides reasonable evidence that there are 

major differences between the two forms of 

memory. Shortly, we will consider evidence 

indicating that the brain areas associated with 

procedural memory differ from those associated 

with declarative memory. However, we must not 

think of declarative and procedural memory 

as being entirely separate. Brown and Robertson 

(2007) gave participants a procedural learning 

task (the serial reaction time task) and a declar-

ative learning task (free recall of a word list). 

Procedural memory was disrupted when declar-

ative learning 
occurred during the retention 
interval. In a second experiment, declarative 

memory was disrupted when procedural learning  

occurred during the retention interval. Thus, 

there can be 
interactions
 between the two 

memory systems.
BEYOND DECLARATIVE 
AND NON-DECLARATIVE 

MEMORY: AMNESIA
Most memory researchers have argued that 
there is a very important distinction between 

declarative/explicit memory and non-declarative/

implicit memory. As we have seen, this distinction 

has proved very useful in accounting for 
most 

of the ˚ ndings (especially those from 
amnesic  
patients). However, there are good grounds for 

arguing that we need to move beyond that 

distinction. We will focus our discussion on 

amnesia, but research on healthy individuals also 

suggests that the distinction 
between declarative 
and non-declarative memory is limited (see Reder,  

Park, & Kieffaber, 2009, for a review).
According to the traditional viewpoint, 
amnesic patients should have intact performance 

on declarative memory tasks and impaired

is an alternative viewpoint that has attracted 

increasing interest (e.g., Reder et al., 2009; Ryan,

p. 24), ﬁThe critical feature that distinguishes 
and Hartman (1989) found that amnesic patients 

and healthy controls showed comparable per-

formance on the serial reaction time task during 

learning and also on a second test one week 

later. Vandenberghe et al. (2006) obtained more 

complex ˚ ndings. They had a deterministic 

condition in which there was a repeating sequence 

and a probabilistic condition in which there was 

a repeating sequence but with some deviations.  

Amnesic patients failed to show skill learning 

in the probabilistic condition, but exhibited 

some implicit learning in the deterministic 

condition. Thus, amnesic patients do not always  

show reasonable levels of skill learning.
Mirror tracing involves tracing a ˚
 gure 
with a stylus, with the ˚
 gure to be traced being 
seen re˜
 ected in a mirror. Performance on this 
task improves with practice in healthy particip-

ants, and the same is true of amnesic patients 

(e.g., Milner, 1962). The rate of learning is 

often similar in 
both groups.
In mirror reading we can distinguish between  
general
 improvement in speed of 
reading pro-
duced by practice and more 
speciÞ
 c
 improvement 
produced by re-reading the same 
groups of words 
or sentences. Cohen and 
Squire (1980) 
reported  
general and speci˚ c improvement in reading 

mirror-
reversed script in amnesics, and there 

was evidence of improvement even after a delay 

of three months. Martone, Butters, Payne, Becker, 

and Sax (1984) also obtained evidence of general 

and speci˚ c improvement in amnesics.
Cavaco, Anderson, Allen, Castro-Caldas, 
and Damasio (2004) pointed out that most 

tasks used to assess skill learning in amnesics 

require learning far removed from that occurring 

in everyday life. Accordingly, Cavaco et al. used 

˚
 ve skill-learning tasks requiring skills similar 
to those needed in the real world. For example, 

there was a weaving tas"

more with practice on the old displays than on 
the new ones. This involved implicit learning, 

because they had no ability to discriminate old 

displays from new ones on a recognition test. The 

amnesic patients showed general improvement 

with practice, and thus some implicit learning. 

However, there was no difference between their 

performance on new and old displays. This failure 

of implicit learning probably occurred because 

the amnesic patients could not bind the arrange-

ment of the distractors to the location of the 

target in old displays.
There have been some failures to replicate 
the above ˚ ndings (see Reder et al., 2009, for 

a review), perhaps because amnesic patients 

differ so much in their precise brain damage and 

memory impairments. Park, Quinlan, Thornton,  

and Reder (2004) argued that a useful approach 

is to use drugs that mimic the effects of amnesia. 

They administered midazolam, a benzodiazepine 

that impairs performance on explicit memory 

tasks but not implicit tasks (e.g., repetition 

priming). They carried out a study very similar 

to that of Chun and Phelps (1999), and obtained 

similar ˚ ndings. Their key result was that healthy 

individuals given midazolam failed to perform 

better on old displays than new ones, in con-

trast to individuals given a placebo (saline) (see 

Figure 7.9). Thus, midazolam-induced amnesia 

impairs implicit learning because it disr"

A study by Huppert and Piercy (1976) on 
declarative memory supports the binding hypo-

thesis. They presented large numbers of pictures 

on day 1 and on day 2. Some of those presented 

on day 2 had been presented on day 1 and 

others had not. Ten minutes after the day-2 

presentation, there was a recognition-memory 

test, on which participants decided which pictures 

had been presented on day 2. Successful per-

formance on this test required binding of picture  

and temporal context at the time of learning. 

Healthy controls performed much better than 

amnesic patients in correctly identifying day-2 

pictures and rejecting pictures presented only 

on day 1 (see Figure 7.10a).Thus, amnesic pati-

ents were at a great disadvantage when binding 

was necessary for memory.
tasks that are impaired from those that are 

spared under amnesia hinges on whether the 

task requires the formation of an association 

(or binding) between the two concepts.ﬂ We 

will brie˜ y consider research relevant to adju-

dicating between these two viewpoints. Before 

we do so, note that the binding-of-item-and-

context model (Diana et al., 2007; discussed 

earlier in the chapter) identi˚ es the hippocampus 

as of central importance in the binding process. 

The relevance of that model here is that amnesic 

patients typically have extensive damage to the 

hippocampus.
Evidence
Earlier in the chapter we discussed a study by 

Schacter et al. (1995) on perceptual priming. 

Amnesic patients and healthy controls iden-

ti˚
 ed words passed through an auditory ˚
 lter 
having previously heard them spoken by the 

same voice or one out of ˚ ve different voices. 

The measure of perceptual priming was the 

extent to which participants were better at 

identifying words spoken in the same voice 

than those spoken in a different voice. Since six  

different voices were used altogether, successful 

perceptual priming required binding or asso-"

In spite of the   fact that Schacter et al. used a non-declarative   memory task, amnesic patients showed no   better performance for words presented in the   same voice than in a different voice (see Figure   7.8b).

ciating the voices with the words when the 

words were presented initially. In spite of the 

fact that Schacter et al. used a non-declarative 

memory task, amnesic patients showed no 

better performance for words presented in the 

same voice than in a different voice (see Figure 

7.8b). This ˚ nding is inconsistent with the 

traditional viewpoint but is as predicted by the 

binding hypothesis.
More evidence that amnesic patients some-
times have de˚ cient implicit memory was reported 

by Chun and Phelps (1999). Amnesic patients 

and healthy controls carried out a visual search 

task in which the target was a rotated T and the  

distractors were rotated Ls. Half the displays 

were new and the remainder were old or repeated. 

There were two main ˚
 ndings with the healthy 
controls. First, their performance improved 

progressively throughout the experiment (skill 

learning). Second, they improved signi˚

that binding is not required.
Evaluation
Since declarative memory tasks generally require 

the formation of associations and non-declarative 

memory tasks do not, it is often hard to decide 

which viewpoint is preferable. However, there 
Huppert and Piercy (1976) also used 
a familiarity-based recognition memory test. 

Participants decided whether they had ever 

seen the pictures before. Here, no prior binding 

of picture and temporal context was necessary.

controls performed the task extremely well 

(see Figure 7.10b). Thus, as predicted by the

7 LONG-TERM MEMORY SYSTEMS 
281
different brain regions contribute to long-term 
memory, with an emphasis on the 
major
 brain 

areas associated with each memory system. As 

we will see, each memory system is associated 

with different brain areas. This strengthens the 

argument that the various memory systems are 

indeed somewhat separate. In what follows, 

we will discuss some of the evidence. The role 

of the anterior temporal lobes in semantic 

memory (e.g., Patterson et al., 2007), early visual 

areas in the occipital lobe in perceptual priming 

( Schacter et al., 2007), and left inferior temporal 

cortex in conceptual priming (e.g., Wig et al., 

2005) were discussed earlier in the chapter.
Medial temporal lobe and medial 
diencephalon
The medial temporal lobe including the hippo-
campal formation is of crucial importance 

in anterograde amnesia and in declarative 

memory generally. However, we have a prob-

lem because chronic alcoholics who develop 

Korsakoff™s syndrome have brain damage to 

the diencephalon including the mamillary bodies  

and various thalamic nuclei (see Figure 7.11). 

Aggleton (2008) arg"

poral lobe amnesia and diencephalic amnesia 

both re˜ ect damage to the same integrated 

brain system involving the temporal lobes and 

the medial diencephalon. Aggleton pointed out 
is increasing support for the binding hypothesis.  

More speci˚ cally, we now have studies showing  

that amnesic patients sometimes fail to show 

non-declarative/implicit memory when binding 

of information (e.g., stimulus 
+
 context) is 
required (e.g., Chun & Phelps, 1999; Schacter 

et al., 1995). In addition, amnesic patients 

sometimes show essentially intact declarative/

explicit memory when binding of information 

is not required (e.g., Huppert & Piercy, 1976).
What is needed for the future? First, we 
need more research in which the predictions 

based on the traditional viewpoint differ from 

those based on the binding hypothesis. Second, 

we should look for tasks that differ more clearly 

in their requirements for binding than most of 

those used hitherto. Third, it is important to 

specify more precisely what is involved in the 

binding process.
LONG-TERM MEMORY AND 
THE BRAIN
Our understanding of long-term memory has 
been greatly enhanced by functional imaging 

studies and research on brain-damaged patients.  

It is clear that encoding and retrieval in long-

term memory involve several processes and are 

more complex than was previously thought.

striatum. 
Parkinson™s disease
 is a progressive 
disorder characterised by tremor of the limbs, 
muscle rigidity, and mask-like facial expression. 

Siegert, Taylor, Weatherall, and Abernethy (2006) 

reported a meta-analysis of learning on the 

serial reaction time task (discussed above) by 

patients with Parkinson™s disease (see Chapter 6).  

Skill learning by Parkinson™s patients was con-

sistently slower than that by healthy controls.
Strong evidence that the basal ganglia are 
important in skill learning was reported by 

Brown, Jahanshahi, Limousin-Dowsey, Thomas, 

Quinn, and Rothwell (2003). They studied 

patients with 
Parkinson™s disease who had had 

posteroventral 
pallidotomy, a surgical form of 
treatment that disrupts the output of the basal 

ganglia to the 
frontal cortex. These patients 

showed no implicit learning at all on the serial  

reaction time task.
Not all the evidence indicates that Parkinson™s 
patients show de˚ cient procedural learning and 

memory. Osman, Wilkinson, Beigi, Castaneda, 

and Jahanshahi (2008) reviewed several studies 

in which Parkinson™s patients performed well 

on procedural learning tasks. In their own 

experiment, participants had to learn about 

and control a complex system (e.g., water-tank 

system). Patients with Parkinson™s disease showed 

the same level of procedural learning as healthy 

controls on this task, which suggests that the 

striatum is 
not needed for all forms of procedural 
learning 
and memory.
Neuroimaging studies have produced some-
what variable ˚ ndings (see Kelly & Garavan, 

2005, for a review). However, practice in skill 

learning is often associated with decreased 

activation in the prefrontal cortex but increased 

activation in the basal ganglia. It is lik"
Segment_500,ely that   the decreased activation in the prefrontal cortex   occurs because attentional and control processes  that the anterior thalamic nuclei and the mam-  millary bodies differ from the rest of the medial    diencephalon in that they both receive direct   inputs from the hippocampal formation,Explores how awareness influences cognition.,"perception, awareness, emotion",Nested under Chapter on awareness,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in awareness,Aligned with contemporary studies on emotion,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_902,"ely that 

the decreased activation in the prefrontal cortex 

occurs because attentional and control processes 
that the anterior thalamic nuclei and the mam-

millary bodies differ from the rest of the medial  

diencephalon in that they both receive direct 

inputs from the hippocampal formation via the 

fornix (see Figure 7.11). Thus, these areas are 

likely to be of major importance within the 

hypothesised integrated system. Aggleton and 

Brown (1999) proposed that an ﬁextended hippo-

campal systemﬂ consisting of the hippocampus, 

fornix, mammillary bodies, and the anterior 

thalamic nuclei is crucial for episodic memory.
There is much support for the notion of an 
extended hippocampal system. Harding, Halliday, 

Caine, and Kril (2000) studied the brains of 

alcoholics with Korsakoff™s syndrome and those 

of alcoholics without amnesia. The only consistent 

difference between the two groups was that the 

Korsakoff patients had degeneration of the anter-

ior thalamic nuclei. There is also evidence for the 

importance of the fornix. Patients with 
benign  
brain tumours who suffer atrophy of the fornix  

as a consequence consistently exhibit clear 
signs 
of anterograde amnesia (Gilboa et al., 2006).
We have focused on anterograde amnesia 
in this section. However, the hippocampal for-

mation and medial temporal lobe are also very 

important in retrograde amnesia (Moscovitch 

et al., 2006). In addition, the hippocampus (and 

the prefrontal cortex) are of central importance in  

autobiographical memory (Cabeza & St. Jacques, 

2007; see Chapter 8).
Striatum and cerebellum
Which brain areas are involved in skill learning 

or procedural memory? Different types of skill 

learning involve different brain areas depending 

on characteristics of the task (e.g., auditory 

versus visual input). However, two brain areas 

are most closely associated with procedural 

memory: the striatum (part of the basal ganglia) 

in particular but also the cerebe"

7 LONG-TERM MEMOR
Y SYSTEMS 
283
are important early in learning but become 
less 
so with extensive practice. Debaere et al. ( 20 04) 
found, during acquisition of a skill requiring co-

ordination of hand movements, that there were 

decreases in activation within 
the right dorso-

lateral prefrontal cortex, the right 
premotor cortex, 
and the bilateral superior parietal cortex. At the 

same time, there were increases in activation 

within the cerebellum and basal ganglia.
In sum, the striatum (and to a lesser extent 
the cerebellum) are important in procedural 

learning and memory. However, we must avoid 

oversimplifying a complex reality. The neuro-

imaging ˚ ndings indicate clearly that several 

other areas (e.g., the prefrontal cortex; the 

posterior parietal cortex) are also involved.
Prefrontal cortex
As discussed in Chapter 5, the prefrontal cortex 

is extremely important in most (or all) executive 

processes involving attentional control. As we 

have seen in this chapter, it is also of signi-

˚
 cance in long-term memory. Two relatively 
small regions on the lateral or outer surface of 

the frontal lobes are of special importance: the 

dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (roughly BA9 and 

B46) and the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex 

(roughly BA45 and BA47) (see Figure 1.4).
Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
What is the role of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex  

in declarative memory? One i"
Segment_502,"dea is that this   area is involved in relational encoding (forming   links between items or between an item and its   context). Murray and Ranganath (2007) carried   out a study in which unrelated word pairs were   presented. In one condition, the task involved   a comparison between the two words",Explores how awareness influences cognition.,"memory, emotion, recognition",Nested under Chapter on recognition,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in memory,Aligned with contemporary studies on attention,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_545,"dea is that this 

area is involved in relational encoding (forming 

links between items or between an item and its 

context). Murray and Ranganath (2007) carried 

out a study in which unrelated word pairs were 

presented. In one condition, the task involved 

a comparison between the two words (relational 

encoding) and in the other it did not (item-

speci˚
 c encoding). Activation of the dorsolateral 
prefrontal cortex was greater during relational 

than item-speci˚ c encoding. More importantly, 

the amount of dorsolateral activity at encoding 

predicted successful performance on a recogni-

tion test of relational memory.
Another possible role of dorsolateral pre-
frontal cortex in memory is to evaluate the 
relevance of retrieved information to current task 

requirements (known as post-retrieval monitor-

ing). The more information that is retrieved, 

the more likely the individual will engage in 

monitoring. Achim and Lepage (2005) manipu-

lated the amount of information likely to be 

retrieved in two recognition-memory tests. As 

predicted, activity within the dorsolateral pre-

frontal cortex was greater when there was more  

demand for post-retrieval monitoring.
In sum, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex plays 
a role at encoding and at retrieval. First, it is 

involved in relational encoding at the time of 

learning. Second, it is involved in post-retrieval 

monitoring at the time of retrieval. In general 

terms, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is often 

activated when encoding and/or retrieval is 

relatively complex.
Ventrolateral prefrontal cortex
Badre and Wagner (2007) discussed a two-

process account of the involvement of the 

ventrolateral prefrontal cortex in declarative 

memory. There is a controlled retrieval process 

used to activate goal-relevant knowledge. There 

is also a post-retrieval selection process that 

deals with competition between memory repre-

sentations active at the same time.
Evidence that both of the above"
Segment_503,"processes  involve the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex was   reported by Badre, Poldrack, Pare-Blagoev,   Insler, and Wagner (2005). A cue word and   two or four target words were presented on   each trial, and the task was to decide which   target word was semantically related to the cue   word.

reported by Badre, Poldrack, Pare-Blagoev, 

Insler, and Wagner (2005). A cue word and 

two or four target words were presented on 

each trial, and the task was to decide which 

target word was semantically related to the cue 

word. It was assumed that the controlled 

retrieval process would be involved when the 

target word was only weakly associated with 

the cue (e.g., cue 
=
 candle; target word 
=
 halo). 
It was also assumed that the post-retrieval 

selection process would be needed when one of  

the incorrect target words was non-semantically 

associated with the cue word (e.g., cue 
=
 ivy; 

incorrect target word 
=
 league). As predicted, 

there was increased activation within the 

ventrolateral prefrontal cortex when the task

and contained less detail than those of healthy 

controls. However, the same patients performed 

normally when they were probed for speci˚
 c 
details of their memories.
Cabeza (2008) explained this and other 
˚
 ndings in his dual attentional processes hypo-
thesis. According to this hypothesis, ventral 

parietal cortex is associated with bottom-up 

attentional processes captured by the retrieval 

output. These attentional processes were dam-

aged in the patients studied by Berryhill et al. 

(2007). In contrast, dorsal parietal cortex is 

associated with top-down attentional processes 

in˜
 uenced by retrieval goals. The hypothesis 
is supported by two ˚ ndings (see Cabeza, 2008, 

for a review):

Kuhl, Kahn, Dudukovic, and Wagner (2008) 
studied the post-retrieval selection process. 

There was activation of the right ventrolateral 

prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate 

when memories that had previously been selected  

against were successfully retrieved. It was 

assumed that an effective post-retrieval selection 

process was needed to permit previously selected-

against memories to be retrieved.
Parietal lobes
What is the involvement of the parietal lobes 

in long-term memory? Simons et al. (2008) 

carried out a meta-analysis of functional neuro-

imaging studies on episodic memory in which 

brain activation was assessed during successful 

recollection of the context in which events had 

occurred. Lateral and medial areas within the 

parietal lobes were more consistently activated 

than any other areas in the entire brain (see 

Figure 7.12).
The picture seems to be very different when 
we consider patients with damage to the parietal 

lobes. For the most part, these patients do not 

seem to have severe episodic memory de˚
 cits 
(see Cabeza, 2008, for a review). However, 

some de˚
 cits have been found in such patients. 
In one study (Berryhill, Phuong, Picasso, Cabeza,

it is needed for initial encoding, for subsequent

relevant processes, or for retrieval of stored

activated during a particular memory task does 

not immediately indicate

 it is activated.
Third, a major task for the future is to

Introduction
†
There are several long-term memory systems. However, the crucial distinction is between

declarative and non-declarative memory. Strong evidence for that distinction comes from

amnesic patients having severely impaired declarative memory but almost intact non-

declarative memory and from functional neuroimaging. Declarative memory can be divided

into episodic and semantic memory. Non-declarative memory can be divided into repeti-

Episodic vs. semantic memory
†
V
irtually all amnesic patients have severe problems with forming new episodic memories
but many have only modest problems in forming new semantic memories. Some amnesic
patients have retrograde amnesia mainly for episodic memory, whereas others have

retrograde amnesia mainly for semantic memory. Damage to the hippocampal complex

has less effect on semantic memory than on episodic memory, whereas damage to the

neocortex impairs semantic memory. Functional neuroimaging also indicates that different

brain areas are associated with episodic and semantic memory.
Episodic 
memory
†
There is an important distinction between familiarity and recollection in recognition
memory. According to the binding-of-item-and-context model, familiarity judgements

depend on perirhinal cortex, whereas recollection depends on binding what and where

information in the hippocampus. Free recall involves similar brain areas to recognition

memory. However
, it is associated with higher levels of brain activity, and it also involves
some brain areas not needed for recognition memory. Episodic memory is basically con-

structive rather than reproductive, and so we remember the gist or essence of our past

experiences. We use the constructive processes associated with episodic memory to imagine

future events.

Semantic memory
†
Collins and Quillian (1969) argued that semantic memory is organised into hierarchical
networks with concept properties stored as high up the hierarchy as possible. This in˜
 ex-
ible approach was superseded by spreading activation theory, in which activation of one

concept causes activation to spread to semantically related concepts. PerceptualŒfunctional

theories assume that the visual or perceptual features of an object are stor"

locations from its functional features. Such theories are oversimpli˚ 
ed. The distributed-
plus-hub theory provides the most comprehensive approach to semantic memory. There

are hubs (uni˚ ed abstract conceptual representations) for concepts as well as distributed

modality-speci˚
 c information. Evidence from patients with semantic dementia indicates
that these hubs are stored in the anterior temporal lobes.
Non-declarative memory
†
Amnesic patients typically have intact repetition priming but impaired declarative memory,
whereas a few patients with other disorders show the opposite pattern. Priming is asso-

ciated with perceptual ˜ uency and increased neural ef˚ 
ciency. Amnesic patients generally
(but not always) have high levels of procedural learning and memory. This is the case

whether standard motor-skill tasks are used or tasks requiring skills similar to those

needed in the real world.
Beyond declarative and non-declarative memory: amnesia
†
Several theorists have argued that the distinction between declarative and non-declarative
memory is oversimpli˚ ed and is inadequate to explain the memory de˚ 
cits of amnesic
patients. According to an alternative viewpoint, amnesic patients are de˚ cient at binding

or forming associations of all kinds. The evidence mostly supports this binding hypothesis

over the traditional viewpoint that amnesic patients are de˚
 cient at declarative or explicit
memory.
Long-term memory and the brain
†
Research on amnesic patients has shown that an extended hippocampal system is crucial
for episodic memory. Skill learning or procedural memory involves the striatum and the

cerebellum. Patients with Parkinson™s disease have damage to the striatum and are gener
-
ally impaired at procedural learning. Neuroimaging studies suggest that the prefrontal

cortex is often involved in the early stages of procedural learning and the striatum at later

stages. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is involved in relational "

EVERYDAY MEMORY
Traditional memory research vs. 
everyday memory research
What are the main differences between the 
traditional approach to memory research and 

the one based on everyday memory phenomena? 

Koriat and Goldsmith (1996) argued that 

traditional memory research is based on the 

storehouse metaphor. According to this meta-

phor, items of information are stored in memory 

and what is of interest is the 
number
 of items 

accessible at retrieval. In contrast, the cor-

respondence metaphor is more applicable to 

everyday memory research. According to this 

metaphor, what is important is the correspond-

ence or goodness of Þ t between an individualÕs 

report and the actual event. Consider eyewitness 

testimony about a crime. According to the 

storehouse metaphor, what matters is simply 

how many items of information can be recalled.  

In contrast, what matters on the correspondence 

metaphor is whether the crucial items of informa-

tion (e.g., facial characteristics of the criminal)  

are remembered. Thus, the 
content
 of what is 

remembered is more important within the 

correspondence metaphor.
Cohen (2008) identiÞ ed other differences 
between the two types of memory research. 

For example, everyday memories are often of 

events that happened a long time ago and 

have frequently been thought about or rehearsed 

during that time. As a result, ÒNaturally 

occurring 
memories are very often memories 
of memories rather than memories of the

consider it in the context of our own everyday 

experience. For example, we "

improve it. Perhaps we also wonder why we 

remember some aspects of our lives much 

better than others, or why we sometimes forget 

to carry out tasks like buying a birthday 

present for a friend or turning up for a dental 

appointment.
It is obviously important to study memory 
in the real world (often known as everyday 

memory). However, for nearly 100 years, most 

research on human memory was carried out 

under laboratory conditions and often used 

artiÞ
 cial learning materials such as lists of non-
sense syllables or unrelated words. This led 

Ulric Neisser (1978, p. 4) to argue in despair, 

ÒIf X is an interesting or socially signiÞ
 cant 
aspect of memory, then psychologists have 

hardly ever studied X.Ó In fact, more memory 

research prior to 1978 was of relevance to the 

phenomena of everyday memory than Neisser 

realised. For example, there was BartlettÕs 

(1932) very inß uential research on the ways in 

which our prior knowledge can distort our 

memory for stories (see Chapter 10). In any 

case, NeisserÕs argument helped to produce a 

dramatic increase in research concerned expli-

citly with everyday memory. Some highlights of 

that research are discussed in this chapter.

retel-

lings contained more affect but fewer

A s   Marsh (2007, p. 19) pointed out",Explores how memory influences cognition.,"emotion, awareness, memory",Nested under Chapter on attention,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in emotion,Aligned with contemporary studies on emotion,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_28," retellings recalled

memory even after those goals have changed.  A s 

Marsh (2007, p. 19) pointed out, ÒWhat people 

remember about events may be the story they 

last told about those events.Ó
What should be done?
Research on human memory should ideally 

possess ecological validity (i.e., applicability to 

real life; see Glossary). Kvavilashvili and Ellis 

(2004) argued that ecological validity consists 

of two aspects: (1) 
representativeness
; and (2) 
originally perceived objects and eventsÓ (p. 2). 

In contrast, participants in laboratory studies 

usually remember information presented shortly 

beforehand.
Original learning in most everyday memory 
research is incidental (i.e., not deliberate), and 

individuals learn information relevant to their 

goals or interests. In most traditional memory 

research, in contrast, learning is intentional, 

and what individuals learn is determined largely 

by the instructions they are given.
We turn now to what is probably the 
most crucial difference between memory as 

traditionally studied and memory in everyday 

life. Participants in traditional memory studies 

are generally motivated to be as accurate as 

possible in their memory performance. In con-

trast, everyday memory research is typically 

based on the notion that, Òremembering is 

a form of purposeful actionÓ (Neisser, 1996, 

p.204). This approach involves three assump-

tions about everyday memory:
It is purposeful.
(1) 
It has a personal quality about it, meaning 
(2) 
it is inß 
uenced by the individualÕs person-
ality and other characteristics.

It is inß
 
uenced by situational demands (e.g., 
(3) 
the wish to impress oneÕs audience).
The essence of NeisserÕs (1996) argument 
is this: what we remember in everyday life is 

determined by our per"
Segment_512,"sonal goals, whereas what   we remember in traditional memory research   is mostly determined by the experimenterÕ s  demands for accuracy. There are occasions in   everyday life when we strive for maximal   accuracy in our recall (e.g., during an examina-  tion;  remembering a shopping list), but a",Explores how attention influences cognition.,"memory, emotion, perception",Nested under Chapter on awareness,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in emotion,Aligned with contemporary studies on emotion,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_284,"sonal goals, whereas what

is mostly determined by the experimenterÕ

demands for accuracy. There are occasions in 

everyday life when we strive for maximal 

accuracy in our recall (e.g., during an examina-

tion; 
remembering a shopping list), but accuracy  
is typically 
not
 our main goal.
Relevant research was reported by Marsh 
and Tversky (2004). Students recorded infor-

mation about their retelling of personal memories 

to other people over a period of one month. The 

students admitted that 42% of these retellings 

were inaccurate. In addition, one-third of the 

retellings they classiÞ ed as accurate nevertheless 

contained distortions.
Neisser (1996) argued that what we remember 
in everyday life is determined by our personal 

goals. A desire to impress our date, for example, 

may introduce inaccuracies into the retelling of 

an anecdote, and may even distort our 

subsequent long-term memory of the event.

or events that happened at a given time in a 
speciÞ
 c place (discussed in Chapter 7). The fact 
that autobiographical and episodic memory 

both relate to personally experienced events 

indicates that there is substantial overlap. 

However, there are various differences. First, 

autobiographical memory is concerned with 

events of personal signiÞ cance, whereas episodic 

memory often relates to trivial events (e.g., was 

the word ÒchairÓ in the Þ rst or the second list?). 

Second, autobiographical memory extends back 

over years or decades, whereas episodic memory 

(at least for events in the laboratory) often 

extends back only for minutes or hours. Third, 

autobiographical memory typically deals with 

complex memories selected from a huge collec-

tion of personal 
experiences, whereas episodic 
memory is much more limited in scope.

and episodic memory (mostly involving memory 

for word lists, word pairs, and so on). There 

were some clear differences in patterns of ac-

tivation within the prefrontal cortex between 

the two forms of memory (see Figure 8.1). 

There was substantially more activation in 

the 
right mid-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex 
inepisodic memory than in autobiographical 

memory. This probably occurs because episodic 

memory requires conscious monitoring 
to avoid 

errors. In contrast, there was much more 
activa-
tion in the left ventromedial prefrontal cortex 

in autobiographical memory than in 
episodic  

memory. This probably happens because 
auto-
biographical memory involves monitoring the 

accuracy of retrieved memories in relation to 

activated knowledge of the self.
Burianova and Grady (2007) carried out 
a study in which the same pictures were used 
generalisability
. Representativeness refers to 

the naturalness of the experimental situation, 

stimuli, and task, whereas generalisability refers  

to the extent to which a studyÕs Þ
 ndings are 
applicable to the real world. Generalisability 

is more important than representativeness. It 

is often (but mistakenly) assumed that everyday 

memory research always has more ecological 

validity than traditional laboratory research. 

Research possessing high ecological validity can 

be carried out by devising naturalistic 
experi-
ments in which the task and conditions resemble 

those found in real life, but the experiment is 

well-controlled.
It used to be argued that traditional memory 
research and everyday memory research are 

mutually antagonistic. That argument is incorrect 

in two ways. First, the distinction between 

these two types of research is blurred and

Of all the hundreds of thousands of memories 
we possess, those relating to our own past, to 

the experiences we have had, and to people 

important to us have special signiÞ
 cance. Our 
own autobiographical memories are of con-

suming interest because they relate to our major 

life goals, to our most powerful emotions, and 

to our personal meanings. As Conway, Pleydell-

Pearce, and Whitecross (2001, p. 493) pointed 

out, autobiographical knowledge has the 

function of ÒdeÞ
 ning identity, linking personal 
history to public history, supporting a network 

of personal goals and projects across the life 

span, and ultimately in grounding the self in 

experience.Ó
It is worth distinguishing between 
auto-
biographical memory and episodic memory. 

Autobiographical memory
 is memory for the

Flashbulb memories
Most people think they have very clear and 

long-lasting autobiographical memories for 

important, dramatic, and surprising public 

events such as the terrorist attacks on the United  

States on 11 September 2001 or the death of 

Princess Diana. Such memories were termed

Many people believe that odours provide very 
powerful cues to remind us of vivid and emo-

tional personal experiences that happened a 

very long time ago.The notion that odours are 

especially good at allowing us to recall very old 

and emotional personal memories is known

as the 
Proust phenomenon
 in honour of the 

French novelist Marcel Proust (1871Œ1922). He 

d escribed how the smell and taste of a tea-soaked 

pastry evoked childhood memories:
I raised to my lips a spoonful of the tea in 

which I had soaked a morsel of the cake. 

No sooner had the warm liquid, and the 

crumbs with it, touched my palate than a 

shudder ran through my entire body  .  .  .  it was 

connected with the taste of tea and cake.  .  .  . 

The smell and taste of things remain poised 

for a long time  .  .  .  and bear unfaltering  .  .  .  the 

vast structure of recollection.
Laird (1935) surveyed 254 eminent men 
and women; 76% of the women and 47% of the 
men claimed that memories triggered by odours 

were among their most vivid. Only 7% of the 

women and 16% of the men said their odour-

triggered memories were emotionally neutral. 

Maylor, Carter, and Hallett (2002) found that 

odour cues were strong in young (mean age 

= 21 years) and older (mean age = 84 years) 

individuals. Both groups recalled twice as many 

autobiographical memories when appropriate 

odour cues were presented.
Chu and Downes (2000, 2004) investigated 
the role of 
olfaction
 (the sense of smell) in 

the recall of autobiographical memories. One 

feature of the Proust phenomenon is that the 

memories triggered by odours are generally 

very old. Chu and Downes found that more 

odour-cued autobiographical memories came 

from the period when participants were between 

the ages of six and ten than any other period. In  

contrast, the peak period for memories triggered 
by verbal cues was between the ages of 11 and 

25.Willander and Larsson (2006) presented

their participants with odour, word, or picture 

cues for autobiographical memories. Most 

memories triggered by odour cues related to 

events occurring before the age of ten, whereas 

the peak age for autobiographical memories 

triggered by visual and verbal cues was between 

11 and 20. In addition,"
Segment_517,"the odour-triggered   memories produced stronger feelings of being   brought back in time.

memories produced stronger feelings of being 

brought back in time.
Chu and Downes (2000) asked participants 
to think of autobiographical events triggered by 

verbal cues corresponding to the names of odorous 

objects. After that, they were presented with 

the appropriate odour, an inappropriate odour, 

a picture of the odorous object, or its verbal 

label and recall further details. The appropriate 

odour triggered recall of more additional details 

than any other cue. In addition, the appropriate 

odour led to a greater increase in the rated 

emotionality of the autobiographical memories 

than did any other cue.
Why
 do odours have such powerful effects? 
First, information about the smell and the taste of  

food and drink is combined in the orbitofrontal 

cortex (Doop et al., 2006), which may produce 

stronger memory traces. The association with 

taste may be important Œ one of the ˚
 rst author™s 
strongest early autobiographical memories involves 

intensely disliking eating beetroot that had been 

soaked in vinegar. Second, most people have far 

fewer autobiographical memories in the olfactory 

modality than in other modalities (e.g., vision). 

This may help to make odour-related memories 

distinctive and protect them from interference. 

Third, language probably plays a smaller role in 

odour-related autobiograph ical memories than 

in other autobiographical memories. Since we 

are bombarded with visually and auditorily pre-

sented language all day long, the relative lack of 

linguistic information in odour-related memories 

may reduce interference effects.

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
Inaccuracies in ßashbulb memories are 
especially likely at long retention intervals. 
Cubelli and Della Sala (2008) assessed ItaliansÕ 

memories for a bomb explosion in Bologna 

that killed 85 people "
Segment_518,"24 years after the event.   Of the small number of personal memories   relating to the explosion that could be checked,   all  were inaccurate!

Of the small number of personal memories 

relating to the explosion that could be checked, 

all
 were inaccurate!
Talarico and Rubin (2003) pointed out 
that we do not really know whether ß
 ashbulb 
memories are better remembered than everyday 

memories because very few studies have assessed 

both kinds of memory. They provided the missing 

evidence. On 12 September 2001, they assessed 

studentsÕ memories for the terrorist attacks of 

the previous day and also their memory for a 

very recent everyday event. The students were 

tested again 7, 42, or 224 days later. There 

were two main Þ ndings (see Figure 8.2). First, 

the reported vividness of ß
 ashbulb memories 
remained very high throughout. Second, ß
 ash-
bulb memories showed no more consistency 

over time than did everyday memories.
Winningham, Hyman, and Dinnel (2000) 
studied memory for the unexpected acquittal 

of O. J. Simpson (a retired American football 

star) accused of murdering his ex-wife and her 

friend. ParticipantsÕ memories changed con-

siderably in the Þ rst few days after hearing about 

the acquittal before becoming consistent. This 

Þ
 nding threatens the notion that ß
 ashbulb 
memories are fully formed at the moment when  

individuals learn about a dramatic event. It also  

makes sense of the literature. Conway et al. 

(1994) found consistent memories over time, 

but they Þ rst tested participants several days 

after Mrs ThatcherÕs resignation. In contrast, 

Talarico and Rubin (2003) found inconsistent 

memories over time with an initial memory test  

the day after September 11. Thus, our memories 

of dramatic world events are often constructed 

over the Þ rst few days after the event.
In sum, the great majority of ß
 ashbulb 
memories contain inaccurate information and 

involve reconstructive processes based on 

what was likely to have been experienced. 

Why do we think that ß
 ashbulb memories 
are special? They are distinctive a"

that ß ashbulb memories are very different from 

other memories in their longevity, accuracy, and 

reliance on a special neural mechanism. Many 

other theorists disagree. Finkenauer, Luminet, 

Gisle, El-Ahmadi, and van der Linden (1998) 

argued that ß ashbulb memories depend on several 

factors, including relevant prior knowledge, per-

sonal importance, surprise, overt rehearsal, the 

novelty of the event, and the individualÕs affective 

attitude towards the central person or persons 

in the event. All these factors can be involved 

in the formation of 
any
 new memory.
Evidence
If ß ashbulb memories involve permanent storage 

of information about dramatic world events, 

they should show 
consistency
 (lack of change) 

over time. Conway, Anderson, Larsen, Donnelly,  

McDaniel, and McClelland (1994) studied ß
 ash-
bulb memories for the unexpected resignation 

of the British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher 

in 1990, which was regarded as surprising and 

consequential by most British people. Memory 

for this event was tested within a few days, 

after 
11 months, and after 26 months. Flashbulb 
memories were 
found in 86% of British partici-
pants after 11 months, and remained consistent 

even after 26 months. However, most research 

on ß ashbulb memories suggests they are not 

special. For example, Bohannon (1988) found 

that many people remembered the explosion 

of the space shuttle 
Challenger
 because they 

had often rehearsed their memories.
Flashbulb memories can be surprisingly 
inaccurate. If you think your memories of 11 

September are accurate, try answering the 

following question: ÒOn September 11, did 

you see the videotape on television of the Þ
 rst 
plane striking the Þ rst tower?Ó Among American 

students, 73% said, ÒYesÓ (Pezdek, 2003). In 

fact, only the videotape of the 
second
 tower 

being hit was available on that day. In similar 

fashion, Ost, Vrij, Costall,"

Figure 8.3). However, even with three cues, 

almost half the events were forgotten over a

involved another person, that person provided 

additional information. This was typically suf-

Þ

However, most autobiographical events we 

remember are more general. For example, 

Barsalou (1988) asked college students to recall 

events of the previous summer. The students 

recalled relatively few on-one-day memories but 

numerous general events extended in time.
Memories across the lifetime
Suppose we ask 70 year olds to recall personal

referring to common objects). From which 
Diary studies
How can we tell whether the memories pro-

duced by participants are genuine? If you have 

read an autobiography recently, you probably 

wondered whether the author provided an 

unduly positive view of him/herself. Evidence 

for distorted autobiographical memory was 

reported by Karney and Frye (2002). Spouses 

often recalled their past contentment as lower 

than their present level of satisfaction because 

they underestimated their past contentment.
We can establish the accuracy of auto-
biographical memories by carrying out a diary 

study. Wagenaar (1986) kept a diary record of 

over 2000 events over a six-year period. For 

each event, he recorded information about 

who, what, where, and when, plus the rated 

pleasantness, emotionality, and salience or 

rarity of each event. He then tested his memory 

by using the who, what, where, and when 

pieces of information singly or in combination. 

ÒWhatÓ information provided easily the most 

useful retrieval cue, probably because our auto-

biographical memories are organised in cat-

egories. ÒWhatÓ information was followed in 

order of decreasing usefulness by ÒwhereÓ, 

ÒwhoÓ, and ÒwhenÓ information, which was 

almost useless. The probability of recall

generally been found in people younger than 
30 years of age, and has not often been observed 

in 40 year olds. There is a detailed discussion of  

factors accounting for the reminiscence bump 

after the next section on infantile amnesia.
Infantile amnesia
Adults may Þ nd it hard to recall the events of 

early childhood because young children Þ
 nd 
it hard to form long-term memories. There 

is some support for this view. Autobiograph-

ical memory is a type of declarative memory 

depending heavily on the hippocampus (see 

Chapter 7). The dentate gyrus within the 

hippocampal formation has only about 70% 

of the adult number of cells at birth, and 

continues to develop through the Þ rst year of 

life. Other parts of the hippocampal formation 

may not be fully developed until the child is 

between two and eight years of age (Richmond 

& Nelson, 2007).
parts of their lives would most of the memories  

come? Rubin, Wetzler, and Nebes (1986) 

answered 
this question by combining Þ
 ndings 
from various studies. There were two Þ
 ndings 
of theoretical interest:
Infantile amnesia
†
 (or childhood amnesia)
shown by the almost total lack of memories

from the Þ 
rst three years of life.
A 
†
reminiscence bump
, consisting of a sur-
prisingly large number of memories coming

from the years between 10 and 30, and

especially between 15 and 25.
A possible limitation of Rubin et al.Õs
Þ
 
ndings is that they were based mainly on 
American participants. This issue was addressed  

by Conway, Wang, Hanyu, and Haque (2005), 

who studied participants from China, UK,

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
The crucial assumption of Howe and 
CourageÕs (1997, p. 499) theory is as follows:
The development of the cognitive self 
late in the second year of life (as indexed 

by visual self-recognition) provides a 

new framework around which memories 

can be organised. W
ith this cognitive 
advance 
. . . , we witness the emergence of 
autobiographical memory and the end 

of infantile amnesia.
The Þnding that the cognitive self appears 
shortly before the onset of autobiographical 
memory around or shortly after childrenÕ
s 
second birthday (see review by Peterson, 2002) 

Þ
 ts the theory. However, it does not show that 
the former plays any role in 
causing
 the latter. 

Stronger evidence comes in a study by Howe, 

Courage, and Edi"
Segment_524,"son (2003). Among infants   aged between 15 and 23 months, self-recognisers    had better memory for personal events  than  infants who were not self-recognisers.  More  strikingly, not a single child showed good   performance on a memory test for personal   events  before  achieving self-recognitio",Explores how recognition influences cognition.,"attention, memory, awareness",Nested under Chapter on memory,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in perception,Aligned with contemporary studies on emotion,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_896,"son (2003). Among infants 

aged between 15 and 23 months, self-recognisers  

had better memory for personal events 
than 
infants who were not self-recognisers. 
More 
strikingly, not a single child showed good 

performance on a memory test for personal 

events 
before
 achieving self-recognition.
The socialÐculturalÐdevelopmental theory 
(e.g., Fivush & Nelson, 2004) provides another 

plausible account of childhood amnesia. Accord-

ing to this theory, language and culture are both 

central in the early development of autobio-

graphical memory. Language is important in 

part because we use language to communicate 

our memories. Experiences occurring before 

children develop language are difÞ cult to express 

in language later on.
Fivush and Nelson (2004) argued that 
parents vary along a dimension of elaboration 

when discussing the past with their children. 

Some parents discuss the past in great detail 

when talking to their children whereas others 

do not. According to the theory, children whose  

parents have an elaborative reminiscing style 

will report more and fuller childhood memories.  

There are important cultural differences here, 

because mothers from Western cultures talk 

about the past in a more elaborated and 

emotional way than those from Eastern cultures 

(Leichtman, Wang, & Pillemer, 2003).
The prefrontal cortex is known to be 
involved in long-term memory (Bauer, 2004). 

Of relevance here, the density of synapses in 

the prefrontal cortex increases substantially at 

about eight months of age, and continues to 

increase until the infant is 15Ð24 months of 

age (Bauer, 2004).
In spite of the fact that brain development 
is incomplete in young children, they still show 

clear evidence of forming numerous long-term 

memories. For example, Fivush, Gray, and 

Fromhoff (1987) studied young children with 

a mean age of 33 months. They were asked 

questions about various signiÞ cant events (e.g., 

a trip to Disneyland) th"

He   argued",Explores how perception influences cognition.,"awareness, emotion, attention",Nested under Chapter on recognition,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in awareness,Aligned with contemporary studies on awareness,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_638,"at had happened some

The most famous (or notorious) account 
of childhood or infantile amnesia is the one 

provided by Sigmund Freud (1915/1957). He 

argued that infantile amnesia occurs through 

repression, with threat-related thoughts and 

experiences (e.g., sexual feelings towards oneÕs 

parents) being consigned to the unconscious. 

Freud claimed that such threatening memories 

are changed into more innocuous memories 

(screen memories). This is a dramatic theory. 

However, it fails to explain why adolescents 

and adults cannot remember 
positive
 and
 neutral
 
events from early childhood.
Howe and Courage (1997) emphasised the 
role played by the development of the cognitive 

self. They argued that infants can only form 

autobiographical memories 
after
 developing a 

sense that events having 
personal
 signiÞ
 cance 
can occur. This sense of self develops towards 

the end of the second year of life. For example, 

Lewis and Brooks-Gunn (1979) carried out 

a study in which infants who had a red spot 

applied surreptitiously to their nose were held 

up to a mirror. Those recognising their own 

reß
ection and so reaching for their own nose 
were claimed to show at least some self-

awareness. Practically no infants in the Þ
 rst year 
of life showed clear evidence of self-awareness, 

but 70% of infants between 21 and 24 months 

did so.

Rubin, Rahhal, and Poon (1998) argued that 

stability and novelty are both involved. Most 

adults have a period of stability starting in early 

adulthood because a sense of adult identity 

develops at that time. This provides a cognitive 

structure serving as a stable organisation to cue 

events. Many memories from early adulthood 

are novel (e.g., Þ rst-time experiences) in that 

they are formed shortly after the onset of adult 

identity. Novelty is an advantage because it 

produces distinctive memories and there is 

a relative lack of proactive interference (inter-

ference from previous learning).
There is limited support for the views of 
Rubin et al. (1998). Pillemer, Goldsmith, Panter, 

and White (1988) asked middle-aged participants 

to recall four memories from their Þ rst year at 

college more than 20 years earlier. They found 

that 41% of those autobiographical memories 

came from the Þ rst month of the course.
Berntsen and Rubin (2002) found that older 
individuals showed a reminiscence bump for 

positive
 memories but not for 
negative
 ones. 

This means that the reminiscence bump is 

more limited in scope than had been believed 

previously. How can we interpret this Þ
 nding? 
One interpretation is based on the notion of 

a 
life script
, which consists of cultural expecta-
tions concerning the major life events in a typical 

personÕs life (Rubin, Berntsen, & Hutson, 2009).  

Examples of such events are falling in love, 
As predicted by the socialÐculturalÐdevelop-
mental theory, the motherÕs reminiscing style 

is an important factor. ChildrenÕs very early 

ability to talk about the past was much better 

among those whose mothers had an elaborative 

reminiscing style (Harley & Reese, 1999). Perhaps 

the simplest explanation is that children whose 

mothers talk in detail about the past are being 

provided with good opportunities to rehearse 

their memories.
The language skills available to children 
at the time of "
Segment_527,an experience determine what   they can recall about it subsequently.

and Hayne (2002) asked two- and three-year-old 

children to describe their memories for com-

plex play activities at 
periods of time up to 

12 months later. The children 
only
 used words 
t hey had already known at the time of the event. 

This is impressive evidence given that they had 

acquired hundreds of new words during the 

retention interval.
Cross-cultural research reveals that adults 
from Eastern cultures have a later age of Þ
 rst 
autobiographical memory than those from 

Western cultures (Pillemer, 1998). In addition, 

the reported memories of early childhood 

are 
much more elaborated and emotional 
i n  American children than in those from Korea 

or China (Han, Leichtman, & Wang, 1998). 

These findings are predictable on the basis 

o f  cultural differences in mothersÕ reminiscing  

style. However, American children may be more 

inclined to report their personal experiences 

than are those from Eastern cultures.
Evaluation
Three points need to be emphasised. First, the 

two theories just discussed are 
not 
mutually 
exclusive. The 
onset
 of autobiographical memory 

in infants may depend on the emergence of 

the 
self, with its subsequent expression being 
heavily inß uenced by social factors, cultural 

factors, and infantsÕ development of language. 

Second, 
all
 the main factors identiÞed in the 
two theories seem to be involved in the devel-

opment of autobiographical memory. Third, 

while the research evidence is supportive, most 

of it only shows an 
association
 in time between, 
life scripts:
 cultural expectations concerning 
the nature and order of major life events in a 

typical person™s life.

Self-memory system
Conway and Pleydell-Pearce (2000) put forward 

an inß uential theory of autobiographical mem-

ory. According to this theory, we possess a self-

memory system with two major components:
Autobiographical memory knowledge 
(1) 
base
: This contains personal information 

at three levels of speciÞ
 city:
Lifetime periods
†
: These generally cover
substantial periods of time deÞ
 ned by 
major ongoing situations (e.g., time 

spent living with someone).

General events
†
: These include repeated
events (e.g., visits to a sports club) and 
single events (e.g., a holiday in South 
marriage, and having children. Most of these 

events are emotionally positive and generally 

occur between the ages of 15 and 30. Rubin 

et al.Õ
s key Þ
 nding was that the major life events 
that individuals recalled from their own lives 

had clear similarities with those included in 

their life script.
a similar viewpoint: ÒThe reminiscence bump 

consists largely of . . . events in which the indi-

vidual made consequential life choices. . . . Such 

choices are characterised by positive valence 

and by a high level of perceived control.Ó Thus, 
The reminiscence bump applies to a period when 
many important life events Œ such as falling in 

love, getting married, and having children Œ tend 

to happen.

conceptual self and episodic memories (previ-
ously called event-speciÞ c knowledge). At the 

top of the hierarchy, the life story and themes 

have been added. The life story consists of 

very general factual and evaluative knowledge 

we possess about ourselves and themes refer 

to major life domains such as work and 

relationships.
Conway (2005) argued that we want our 
autobiographical memories to exhibit coherence 

(consistency with our current goals and beliefs). 

However, we also often want our autobio-

graphical memories to exhibit correspondence 

(being accurate). In the battle between coherence 

and correspondence, coherence tends to win 

out over correspondence over time.
Evidence
Studies of brain-damaged patients suggest 

that there are three types of autobiographical 

knowledge. Of particular importance are 

cases of retrograde amnesia in which there is 

widespread forgetting of events preceding the 

brain injury (see Chapter 7). Many patients 

have great difÞ culty in recalling event-speciÞ
 c 
knowledge but their ability to recall general 

events and lifetime periods is less impaired 

(Conway & Pleydell-Pearce, 2000). Even KC, 

who has no episodic memories, possesses some 

general autobiographical knowledge about his 

life (Rosenbaum et al., 2005).
Autobiographical memory and the self are 
closely related. Woike, Gershkovich, Piorkowski, 

and Polo (1999) distinguished between two 

types of personality:
Africa). General events are often related 

to each other as well as to lifetime 

periods.

base. They also partially determine which 

autobiographical memories we recall. The
 
goals of the working self inß uence the kinds 

of memories stored in the autobiographical 

memory knowledge base. As a result, 

ÒAutobiographical memories are pri-

m arily records of success or failure in goal 

attainmentÓ (p. 266).
According to the theory, autobiographical 
memories can be accessed through generative 

or direct retrieval. We use 
generative retrieval
 

when we deliberately construct autobiograph-

ical memories by combining the resources of 

the working self with information contained 

in the autobiographical knowledge base. As 

a result, autobiographical memories produced 

via generative retrieval often relate to the 

individualÕs goals as contained within the 

working self. In contrast, direct retrieval does 

not involve the working self. Autobiographical 

memories produced by 
direct retrieval
 are trig-

gered by speciÞ c cues (e.g., hearing the word 

ÒParisÓ on the radio may produce direct retrieval 

of a memory of a holiday there). Remembering 

autobiographical memories via generative re-

trieval is more effortful and involves more 

active involvement by the rememberer than 

does direct retrieval.
Conway (2005) developed the above theory 
(see Figure 8.6). The knowledge structures 

inautobiographical memory divide into the

 deliberate or voluntary 
construction of autobiographical memories 

based on an individual™s current goals; see

Both of these predictions were conÞ
 rmed.
Evaluation
Conway and Pleydell-Pearce (2000) and Conway 

( 2005) put forward a reasonably comprehensive 

theory of autobiographical memory. Several 

of their major theoretical assumptions (e.g., 

thehierarchical structure of autobiographical 

memory; the intimate relationship between 

autobiographical memory and the self; and the 

importance of goals in autobiographical memory) 

are well supported by the evidence. In addition, 

the fact that several brain regions are involved 

in the generative retrieval of autobiographical 

memories is consistent with the general notion 

that such retrieval is complex.
What are the limitations of the theory? 
First, autobiographical memory may involve more 

processes and more brain areas than assumed 

within the theory (Cabeza & St. Jacques, 2007; 

discussed below). Second, we need to know 

more about 
how
 the working self interacts with 

the autobiographical knowledge base to produce 

recall of speciÞ c autobiographical memories. 

Third, it remains to be seen whether there is 

a clear distinction between generative and 

direct retrieval. It may well be that the recall 

of autobiographical memories often involves 

elements of both modes of retrieval. Fourth, 

autobiographical memories vary in the extent 

to which they contain episodic information 

(e.g., contextual details) and semantic informa-

tion (e.g., schema-based), but this is not fully 

addressed within the theory.

and St. Jacques (2007)

individuals with a communal person-
ality recalled 
more memories concerned with 
communion (e.g., love, friendship, betrayal of 

trust) than those with an agentic personality.
Evidence supporting the distinction between 
generative or voluntary retrieval of autobio-

graphical memories and direct or involuntary 

retrieval was reported by Berntsen (1998) and 

Berntsen and Hall (2004). Berntsen (1998) 

compared memories produced by voluntary 

retrieval (i.e., elicited by cues) and by involuntary  

retrieval (i.e., coming to mind with no attempt 

to recall them). More of the latter memories 

were of speciÞ
c events (89% versus 63%, 
respectively). Berntsen and Hall (2004) repeated 

these Þ ndings. In addition, the cues most asso-

ciated with direct retrieval of autobiographical 

memories were speciÞ c ones, such as being in 

the same place as the original event (61% of 

cases) or being in the same place engaged in 

the same activity (25% of cases).
Conway and Pleydell-Pearce (2000) argued 
that generative retrieval initially involves the 

control processes of the working self followed 

by activation of parts of the autobiographical 

knowledge base. They speculated that processes  

within the working self involve activation in 

the frontal lobes, whereas processes within 

the a
utobiographical knowledge base involve 

activation in more posterior areas of the brain. 

Conway, Pleydell-Pearce, and Whitecross (2001) 

found extensive activation in the left frontal 

lobe during the initial stages of generative 

retrieval of autobiographical memories. After 

that, when an autobiographical memory was 

being held in conscious awareness, there was 

activation in the temporal and occipital lobes, 

especially in the right hemisphere.

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
(2006) found that there was more activation 
in lateral prefrontal cortex during retrieval 

of autobiographical than of laboratory-

formed memories, and much of this 

activation continued through most of the 

retrieval period. This is consistent with 

the notion that the construction of auto-

biographical memories requires almost con-

tinuous search and controlled processes.

Self-referential processes
(2) 
: Evidence that 
self-referential processes involve medial 

prefrontal cortex was reported by Cabeza
 
et al. (2004). That brain region was more 

activated when participants recognised 

photographs taken by themselves than 

photographs taken by other people.

Recollection
(3) 
: The retrieval of basic 
auto-
biographical memories involves the hippo-

campus and parts of the medial temporal 

lobes. Gilboa et al. (2005) found that loss 

of autobiographical memory in patients 

with AlzheimerÕs disease correlated with the
 
amount of damage to the medial temporal 

lobes including the hippocampus.

Emotional processing
(4) 
: Autobiographical 
memories are generally more emotional than 
laboratory-formed memories, and involve
 
processing within the amygdala. Buchanan, 

Tranel, and Adolphs (2006) found that 

patients with damage to the amygdala as 

well as the medial temporal lobes had 

greater 
impairment in retrieving emotional 
autobiographical memories than patients 

with damage to the medial temporal lobes 

but not the amygdala.

nearly always activated during autobiographical  

retrieval, as were medial and lateral temporal 

cortex. SummerÞ eld, Hassabis, and Maguire 

(2009) provided a more detailed picture of 

the involvement of the prefrontal cortex. 

Participants 
recalled autobiographical and non-
autobiographical (e.g., from television news 

clips) events that were either real or imagined. 

Recollection of real autobiographical events 

(compared to recall of imagined autobiographical  

events) was associated with activation in the 

ventromedial prefrontal cortex as well as the 

posterior cingulate cortex.
Cabeza and St. Jacques (2007) agreed that 
the prefrontal cortex is of major importance 

in autobiographical retrieval. They produced 

a comprehensive theoretical framework within 

which to understand autobiographical memory 

from the perspective of cognitive neuroscience 

(see Figure 8.7). The six main processes assumed 

to be involved in retrieval of autobiographical 

memories are as follows:

You might assume that most jurors and 
judges would be knowledgeable about potential 

problems with eyewitness testimony. However, 

that assumption is wrong. Benton, Ross, Bradshaw, 

Thomas, and Bradshaw (2006) asked judges, 

jurors, and eyewitness experts 30 questions con-

cerned with eyewitness issues. Judges disagreed 

with the experts on 60% of the issues and jurors 

disagreed with the experts on 87%!
Eyewitness testimony can be distorted via 
con˚
 rmation bias
, i.e., event memory is inß
 uenced 
by the observerÕs expectations. For example, 

consider a study by Lindholm and Christianson 

(1998). Swedish and immigrant students saw 

a videotaped simulated robbery in which the 

perpetrator seriously wounded a cashier with 

a knife. After watching the video, participants 

were shown colour photographs of eight men 

Ðfour Swedes and the remainder immigrants.

Both Swedish and immigrant participants were 

twice as likely to select an innocent immigrant 

as an innocent Swede. Immigrants are over-

represented in Swedish crime statistics, and this 

inß
 uenced participantsÕ expectations concerning 
the likely ethnicity of the criminal.
Bartlett (1932) explained 
why
 our memory 
is inß uenced by expectations. He argued that 

we possess numerous schemas or packets of 

knowledge stored in long-term memory. These 

schemas lead us to form certain expectations 

and can distort our memory by causing us to 

reconstruct an eventÕs details based on Òwhat"

: This is 
a rapid, preconscious process to check

prefrontal cortex. Gilboa et al. (2006) 

reported that patients with damage in the 

ventrolateral prefrontal cortex uninten-

tionally produce false autobiographical 

memories, which suggests a failure of 

monitoring.
Evaluation
Cabeza and St. Jacques (2007) provide an 

impressive overview of the major processes 

involved in the retrieval of autobiographical 

memories and the associated brain regions. 

There is reasonably strong evidence for all of 

the processes they identify, and they have gone 

further than previous theorists in coming to 

grips with the complexities of autobiographical 

memory. An exciting implication of their 

theoretical framework is that brain-damaged 

patients could have several different patterns of  

autobiographical memory impairment depending 

on which brain regions are damaged.
The next step would appear to be to establish 
more clearly 
interactions 
among the six processes. 
For example, the process of recollection affects 

(and is affected by) four other processes, but 

the bi-directional arrows in Figure 8.7 are not 

very informative about the details of what is 

happening.
EYEWITNESS TESTIMONY
Many innocent people have been found guilty 

of a crime and sent to prison. In the United 

States, for example, approximately 200 people 

have been shown to be innocent by DNA tests, 

and more than 75% of them were found guilty 

on the basis of mistaken eyewitness identiÞ
 ca-
tion. For example, in early 2008, DNA testing 

led to the release of Charles Chatman, who 

had spent nearly 27 years in prison in Dallas 

County, Texas. He was 20 years old when a 

young woman who had been raped picked him

whose heart rate was similar on both occasions

oculating nurse was 31% for the high-reactive 

group and 59% for the low-reactive group. 

Thus, participants regarding the inoculation as

showed much worse memory than those re-

Pickel (1999) pointed out that the weapon 
focus effect may occur because the weapon 

poses a threat or because it attracts attention 

because it is unexpected in most of the contexts 

in which it is seen by eyewitnesses. Pickel pro-

duced four videos involving a man approaching

The Þ ndings were clear

EyewitnessesÕ descriptions of the man were 

much better when the gun was seen in an 

expected setting (a shooting range) than one 

in which it was unexpected (a baseball Þ
 eld). 
However, the level of threat had no effect on 

eyewitnessesÕ memory.
Weapon focus may be less important with 
real line-ups or identiÞ cation parades than 

in the laboratory. Valentine, Pickering, and 

Darling (2003) found in over 300 real line-ups 

that the presence of a weapon had no effect 

on the probability of an eyewitness identifying 

the suspect (but bear in mind that the suspect 

wasnÕt always the culprit!). However, Tollestrup, 

Turtle, and Yuille (1994) found evidence for 

the weapon focus effect in their analysis of 

police records of real-life crimes.

will consider factors determining whether culpritsÕ 
faces are remembered (see also Chapter 3).
Eyewitnesses sometimes remember a face 
but fail to remember the precise circumstances 

in which they saw it. In one study (Ross, Ceci, 

Dunning, & Toglia, 1994), eyewitnesses observed  

an event in which a bystander was present as 

well as the culprit. Eyewitnesses were three times 

more likely to select the bystander than someone 

else they had not seen before from a line-up 

including the bystander but not the culprit. This 

effect is known as 
unconscious transference
 

Ða face is correctly recognised as having been

that of someone seen before but incorrectly 

judged to be responsible for a crime. Ross et al.  

found there was no unconscious transference 

effect when eyewitnesses were informedbe-

fore seeing the line-up that the bystander and 

the culprit were not the same person.
You might imagine that an eyewitnessÕs ability 
to identify the culprit of a crime would be 

increased if he/she were asked initially to provide 

a verbal description of the culprit. In fact, 

eyewitnessesÕ recognition memory for 
faces is 
generally
 worse
 if they have previously provided 

a verbal description! This is known as 
verbal 

overshadowing
, and was Þ
 rst demonstrated by 
Schooler and Engstler-Schooler 
(1990). After 

eyewitnesses had watched aÞ
lm of a crime, 
they provided a detailed verbal 
report of the 

criminalÕs appearance or performed 
an unre-
lated task. The eyewitnesses who had pro"

Why does verbal overshadowing occur? 
Clare and Lewandowsky (2004) argued that 

providing a verbal report of the culprit can 
than that of younger adults. That is, indeed, the 

case. Dodson and Krueger (2006) showed a video 

to younger and older adults, who later completed 

a questionnaire that misleadingly referred to 

events not shown on the video. The older adults 

were more likely than the younger ones to pro-

duce 
false memories triggered by the misleading 
suggestions. Worryingly, the older adults tended 

to be very conÞ dent about the correctness of 

their false memories. In contrast, the younger 

adults were generally rather uncertain about 

the accuracy of their false memories.
The effects of misinformation are sometimes 
much greater on older than on younger adults. 

Jacoby, Bishara, Hessels, and Toth (2005) pre-

sented misleading information to younger and 

older adults. On a subsequent recall test, the 

older adults had a 43% chance of producing 

false memories compared to only 4% for the 

younger adults.
Wright and Stroud (2002) considered 
differences between younger and older adults 

who tried to identify the culprits after being 

presented with crime videos. They found an 

Òown age biasÓ, with both groups being more 

accurate at identiÞ cation when the culprit 

was of a similar age to themselves. Thus, older 

adultsÕ generally poorer eyewitness memory 

was less so when the culprit was an older 

person, perhaps because they paid more atten-

tion to the facial and other features of someone 

of similar age to themselves.
In sum, older adults very often produce 
memories that are genuine in the sense that 

they are based on information or events to which 

they have been exposed. However, they often 

misremember the context or circumstances in 

which the information was encountered. Thus,

make eyewitnesses more reluctant to identify 
anyone on a subsequent line-up. The verbal 

overshadowing effect disappeared when eye-

witnesses were forced to select someone from 

the line-up and so could not be cautious. 

Excessive caution may be the main explanation 
The cross-race effect
The accuracy of eyewitness identi˚
 cation depends 
in part on the 
cross-race effect
, in which 

same-race faces are recognised better than cross-

race faces. For example, Behrman and Davey 

(2001) found, from an analysis of 271 actual 

criminal cases, that the suspect was much more 

likely to be identi˚ ed when he/she was of the 

same race as the eyewitness rather than a differ-

ent race (60% versus 45%, respectively).
How can we explain the cross-race effect? 
According to the expertise hypothesis, we have 

had much more experience at distinguishing 

among same-race than cross-race faces and so 

have developed expertise at same-race face 

recognition. According to the social-cognitive 

hypothesis, we process the faces of individuals 

with whom we identify (our ingroup) more 

thoroughly than those of individuals with whom 

we don™t identify (outgroups).
Much evidence seems to support the exper-
tise hypothesis. For example, eyewitnesses having

est. 
Shriver et al. studied the cross-race effect in  
middle-
class white students at the University of 

Miami.They saw photographs of 
black 
or white 

college-aged males in impoverished contexts (e.g., 

dilapi
dated housing; run-down public spaces) 

or in wealthy contexts (e.g., large suburban 

homes; golf courses).They then received a test 

of recognition memory.
What did Shriver et al. (2008) ˚ nd?There 
were three main ˚
 ndings (see Figure 8.10). First, 
there was a cross-race effect when white and 

black faces had been seen in wealthy contexts. 

Second, this effect disappeared when white and 

black faces had been seen in impoverished con-

texts.Third, the white participants recognised 

white faces much better when they had been 

seen in wealthy rather 
than impoverished con-
texts.Thus, as pr
edicted by the social-cognitive 
hypothesis, 
only
 ingroup faces (i.e., white faces  
seen in wealthy 
contexts) were well recognised. 
The precise relevance of these ˚ ndings for eye-

witness identi˚ cation needs to be explored. 

However, it is clear that the context in which 

a face is seen can in˜ uence how well it is 

remembered.

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
The tendency for eyewitness memory to be 
inß
 uenced by misleading post-event informa-
tion is very strong. Eakin, Schreiber, and 
Sergent-Marshall (2003) showed participants 

slides of a maintenance man repairing a chair 

in an ofÞ ce and stealing some money and a 

calculator. Eyewitness memory was impaired 

by misleading post-event information. Of key 

importance, there was often memory impair-

ment even when the eyewitnesses were warned 

immediately about the presence of misleading 

information.
We have seen that information acquired 
between original learning (at the time of the 

event) and the subsequent memory test can 

disrupt memory performance. This is retroactive 

interference, deÞ ned as disruption of memory 

by the learning of other material during the 

retention interval (see Chapter 6). Can eyewitness 

memory also be distorted by proactive interfer-

ence (i.e., learning occurring 
prior
 to observing 
the critical event?). Evidence that the answer is 

positive was reported by Lindsay, Allen, Chan, 

and Dahl (2004). Participants were shown a 

video of a museum burglary. On the previous 

day, they listened to a narrative either thematic-

ally similar (a palace burglary) or thematically 

dissimilar (a school Þ eld-trip to a palace) to 

the video. Eyewitnesses made many more errors 

when recalling information from the video 

when the narrative was thematically similar.
of the verbal overshadowing effect when eye-

witnesses provide a fairly brief verbal description 

of the culprit. However, verbal overshadowing 

can depend on other factors (see Chin & 

Schooler, 2008, for a review). For example, 

eyewitnesses tend to focus on speciÞ
 c facial 
features when producing a verbal description, 

but face recognition is typically best when 

eyewitnesses process the face as a whole (Chin 

& Schooler, 2008; see Chapter 3).

The most obvious explanation for the inaccurate 

memories of eyewitnesses is that they often 

fail to pay attention to the crime and to the 

criminal(s). After all, the crime they observe 

typically occurs suddenly and unexpectedly. 

However, Loftus and Palmer (1974) argued 

that what happens 
after
 observing the crime 

(e.g., the precise questions eyewitnesses are 

asked) can easily distort eyewitnessesÕ fragile 

memories. They showed eyewitnesses a Þ
 lm of 
a multiple car accident. After viewing the Þ
 lm, 
eyewitnesses described what had happened, 

and then answered speciÞ c questions. Some 

were asked, ÒAbout how fast were the cars going 

when they smashed into each other?Ó For other 

participants, the verb ÒhitÓ was substituted for 

Òsmashed intoÓ. Control eyewitnesses were not 

asked a question 
about car speed. The estimated  
speed was affected by the verb used in the 

question, averaging 41 mph when the verb 

ÒsmashedÓ was used versus 34 mph when 

ÒhitÓ was used. Thus, the information implicit 

in the question affected how the accident was 

remembered.
One week later, all the eyewitnesses were 
asked, ÒDid you see any broken glass?Ó In fact, 

there was no broken glass in the accident, but 

32% of those previously asked about speed 

using the verb ÒsmashedÓ said they had seen 

broken glass (see Figure 8.11). In contrast, only 

14% of those asked using the verb ÒhitÓ said 

they had seen broken glass, and the Þ
 gure was 
12% for controls. Thus, our memory for events 

is sometimes so fragile it can be distorted by 

changing one word in one question!

Second, there is the

combined together in memory. 
Fourth, 
there is

: the way a study 
is conducted may bias eyewitnesses towards 

reporting the misinformation rather than in-

formation from the original event.
From laboratory to courtroom
You may be wondering whether we can safely 

apply Þ ndings from laboratory studies to real-

life crimes. There are several important dif-

ferences. First, in the overwhelming majority 

of laboratory studies, the event in question is 

observed by eyewitnesses rather than the victim 

or victims. This is quite different to real-life 

crimes, where evidence is much more likely to 

be provided by the victim than by eyewitnesses. 

Second, it is much less stressful to watch a 

video of a violent crime than to experience 

one in real life (especially if you are the 

victim). Third, laboratory eyewitnesses gener-

ally observe the event passively from a single 

perspective. In contrast, eyewitnesses to a 

real-life event are likely to move around and 

may be forced to interact with those commit-

ting the crime. Fourth, in laboratory research 

the consequences of an eyewitness making a 

mistake are trivial (e.g., minor disappointment 

at his/her poor memory), but can literally be 

a matter of life or death in an American court 

of law.
Do the above differences between observersÕ 
experiences in the laboratory and in real life 

have large and systematic effects on the accur-

acy of eyewitness memory? Lindsay and 

Harvie (1988) had eyew"

events. The accuracy of culprit identiÞ
 cation 
was very similar across these three conditions, 
The discovery that eyewitnessesÕ memory 
can be systematically distorted by information 

presented before or after observing a crime is 

worrying. However, such distorting effects may 

be less damaging than might be imagined. Most 

research has focused on distortions for periph-

eral or minor details (e.g., presence of broken 

glass) and has not considered distortions for 

central features. Dalton and Daneman (2006) 

carried out a study in which eyewitnesses 

watched a video clip of an action sequence and 

were then presented with misinformation about 

central and peripheral features. Memory dis-

tortions were much more common following 

misinformation about peripheral features 

than following misinformation about central 

features. However, eyewitnesses showed some 

susceptibility to misinformation even about 

central features.
Theoretical explanations
How does misleading post-event information 

distort what eyewitnesses report? One pos-

sibility is that there is source misattribution 

(Johnson, Hashtroudi, & Lindsay, 1993). The 

basic idea is that a memory probe (e.g., a ques-

tion) activates memory traces overlapping with 

it in terms of the information they contain. 

Any memory probe may activate memories 

from various sources. The individual decides 

on the 
source
 of any activated memory on the 

basis of the information it contains. Source 

misattribution is likely when the memories 

from one source resemble those from a second 

source. Allen and Lindsay (1998) presented 

two narrative slide shows describing two dif-

ferent events with different people in different 

settings. However, some details in the two events 

were similar (e.g., a can of Pepsi versus a can 

of Coke). When eyewitnesses were asked to recall 

the Þ rst event, some details from the seco"

Wright and Loftus (2008) identiÞ  ed several  factors in addition to source misattribution   that can lead eyewitnesses to be misled by post-  event information.

studied the evidence from 640 eyewitnesses 
who tried to identify suspects in 314 real line-

ups. About 20% of witnesses identiÞ ed a non-

suspect, 40% identiÞ ed the suspect, and 40% 

failed to make an identiÞ
 cation.
There has been a dramatic increase in the 
number of closed-circuit television (CCTV) 

cameras in many countries. It seems reason-

able to assume that it would be easy to identify 

someone on the basis of CCTV images. In fact, 

that is not necessarily the case. Bruce, Henderson, 

Greenwood, Hancock, Burton, and Miller (1999) 

presented people with a target face taken from 

a CCTV video together with an array of ten 

high-quality photographs (see Figure 8.12). Their 

task was to select the matching face or to 

indicate that the target face was 
not
 present. 

Performance was poor. When the target face was 

present, it was selected only 65% of the time. 

When it was 
not
 present, 35% of participants 

nevertheless claimed that one of the faces in 

the array matched the target face. Allowing 

the parti cipants to watch a Þ
 ve-second video 
segment of the target person as well as a photo-

graph of their face had no effect on identiÞ
 cation 
performance.
Improving matters
How can we increase the effectiveness of eye-

witness identiÞ
 cation procedures? It is often 
assumed that warning eyewitnesses that the 

culprit may not be in a line-up reduces the 

chances of mistaken identiÞ
 cation. Steblay 
(1997) carried out a meta-analysis. Such warn-

ings reduced mi"

Line-ups can be simultaneous (the eye-
witness sees everyone at the same time) or 

sequen
tial (the eyewitness sees only one person 

a t  a time). Steblay, Dysart, Fulero, and Lindsay 

(2001) found, in a meta-analysis, that the 

chance of an eyewitness mistakenly selecting 

someone when the line-up did not contain the 

culprit was 28% with sequential line-ups and 

51% with simultaneous line-ups. However, 

sequential line-ups were less effective than 
suggesting that artiÞ cial laboratory conditions 

do not distort Þ
 ndings.
Ihlebaek, L¿ve, Eilertsen, and Magnussen 
(2003) used a staged robbery involving two 

robbers armed with handguns. In the live con-

dition, eyewitnesses were ordered repeatedly 

to ÒStay downÓ. A video taken during the live 

condition was presented to eyewitnesses in the 

video condition. There were important simil-

arities in memory in the two conditions. 

Participants in both conditions exaggerated 

the duration of the event, and the patterns of 

memory performance (i.e., what was well and 

poorly remembered) were similar. However, 

eyewitnesses in the video condition recalled 

more information. They estimated the age, 

height, and weight of the robbers more closely, 

and also identiÞ ed the robbersÕ weapons more 

accurately.
Ihleback et al.Õs (2003) Þ
 ndings suggest 
that witnesses to real-life events are more in-

accurate in their memories of those events than 

those observing the same events under labora-

tory conditions. That Þ nding (if conÞ
 rmed) is 
important. It implies that the inaccuracies 

and distortions in eyewitness memory obtained 

under laboratory conditions provide an

estimate
 of eyewitnessesÕ memory deÞ
 ciencies

Eyewitness identi˚ cation
The police often ask eyewitnesses to identify 

the person responsible for a crime from various 

people either physically present or shown in 

photographs. Eyewitness identiÞ
 cation from 
such identiÞ
 cation parades or line-ups is often 
very fallible (see Wells & Olson, 2003, for a 

review). For example, Valentine et al. (2003)

Douglass and Steblay (2006) carried out a 
meta-analysis on studies in which feedback was  
given to eyewitnesses after they had made an 

identiÞ
 cation. Eyewitnesses who received con-
Þ
 rming feedback (e.g., ÒGood, you identiÞ
 ed 
the suspectÓ) believed mistakenly that they had 

been very conÞ dent in the accuracy of their 

identiÞ
 cation before receiving the feedback. 
This Þ nding suggests that witnessesÕ reports 

should be recorded immediately after making 

an identiÞ cation and that no feedback of any 

kind should be provided.
Cognitive interview
It is obviously important for police to interview 

eyewitnesses so as to maximise the amount 

of accurate information they can provide. 

According to Geiselman, Fisher, MacKinnon, 
simultaneous ones when the line-up did contain 

the culprit: the culprit was selected only 35% 

of the time with sequential line-ups compared 

to 50% of the time with simultaneous line-ups.

a more stringent criterion for identiÞ
 cation with 
sequential than with simultaneous line-ups.

Kıhnken, Milne, Memon, and Bull (1999) 
reported a meta-analysis based on over 50 

studies. The cognitive interview on average led 

to the recall of 41% more correct details than 

standard police interviews. However, there was 

a small cost in 
terms of reduced accuracy. The 

average eye
witness given a cognitive interview 

produced 61% more errors than those given 

a standard interview.
and Holland (1985), effective interviewing 

techniques need to be based on the following 

notions:
Memory traces are usually complex and
†
contain various kinds of information.

The effectiveness of a retrieval cue depends
†
on its informational overlap with informa-

tion stored in the memory trace; this is the

encoding speciÞ city principle (see Chapter 6).

Various retrieval cues may permit access to

any given memory trace; if one is ineffec-

tive, Þ
 
nd another one. For example, if you
canÕt think of someoneÕ
s name, form an
image of that person, or think of the Þ
 rst
letter of their name.
Geiselman et al. (1985) used the above
notions to develop the 
cognitive interview
:
The eyewitness recreates the context exist-
†
ing at the time of the crime, including en-

vironmental and internal (e.g., mood state)

information.

The eyewitness reports everything he/she

can remember about the incident even if

the information is fragmented.

The eyewitness reports the details of the

incident in various orders.

ous perspectives, an approach that Anderson

longer retention intervals (Geiselman & Fisher, 
1997). Thus, eyewitnesses should be inter-

viewed as soon as possible after the event.
Fourth, there are several components to 
the cognitive interview (especially in its enhanced  

form), and it remains somewhat unclear which 

components are more and less important. There 

is some evidence that recreating the context 

and reporting everything no matter how frag-

mented are more important than recalling in 

different orders and from different perspectives.
Fifth, some of the evidence (e.g., Centofanti 
& Reece, 2006) suggests that the cognitive 

interview is ineffective in reducing the negative 

effects of misleading information. Thus, it is 

very important to ensure that eyewitnesses are 

not exposed to misleading information even if 

they are going to be questioned by a cognitive 

interview.
PROSPECTIVE MEMORY
Most studies of human memory have been 

on 
retrospective memory
. The focus has been 
on the past, especially on peopleÕs ability to

knowledge they have acquired previously. In

After a change in his usual routine, an

daycare centre and instead drove his 

usual route to work at the university. 
Is it essential to use all of the ingredients of 
the cognitive interview? It has often been found 

that the effectiveness of the cognitive interview 

was scarcely reduced when eyewitnesses did 

not recall in different orders or from various 

perspectives (see Ginet & V
erkampt, 2007,
 
for a review). In their own study, Ginet and 

Verkampt showed eyewitnesses a video of a 
road 
accident. They then used a cognitive interview 

omitting recalling in different orders and from 

different perspectives or a 
structured interview 

without the social components of the cognitive 

interview. About 17% more correct details were 

recalled with the cognitive interview.
Does the cognitive interview reduce the 
adverse effects of misleading information pro-

vided after witnessing an incident? This ques-

tion was addressed by Centofanti and Reece 

(2006). Eyewitnesses watched a video of a 

bank robbery followed by neutral or mislead-

ing information. Overall, 35% more correct 

details were remembered with the cognitive 

interview than with the structured interview 

with no increase in errors. However, the adverse 

effects of misleading information on eyewitness 

memory were as great with the cognitive inter-

view as with the structured interview.
Evaluation
The cognitive interview has proved itself to be 

more effective than other interview techniques 

in obtaining as much accurate information as 

possible from eyewitnesses. Its effectiveness 

provides support for the underlying principles 

that led to its development. However, the cog-

by Smith et al. (2000), they found evidence for 

separate prospective and retrospective memory 

factors. In addition, however, there was also a 

general memory factor incorporating elements 

of prospective and retrospective memory.

the appropriate circumstances (e.g., passing on 

a message when you see someone).
Several hours later, his infant son, who 

had been quietly asleep in the back seat, 

was dead.
According to Ellis and Freeman (2008), 
prospective memory involves Þ
 ve 
stages:
Encoding
(1) 
: The individual stores away 
information about 
what
 action needs to 
be performed, 
when
 the action needs to 
be performed, and the 
intention
 to act.

Retention
(2) 
: The stored information has to 
be retained over a period of time.

Retrieval
(3) 
: When a suitable opportunity 
presents itself, the intention has to be 

retrieved from long-term memory.
Execution
(4) 
: When the intention is retrieved,
 
it needs to be acted upon.

Evaluation
(5) 
: The outcome of the preceding 
stages is evaluated. If prospective memory 

has failed, there is re-planning.
How different are prospective and retro-
spective memory? As Baddeley (1997) pointed 

out, retrospective memory generally involves 

remembering 
what 
we know about something 
and can be high in informational content. In 

contrast, prospective memory typically focuses 

on 
when
 to do something, and has low in-
formational content. The low informational 

content helps to ensure that any failures to 

perform the prospective memory task are 
not
 
due to retrospective memory failures. In addi-

tion, prospective memory (but not retrospective 

memory) is relevant to the plans or goals we 

form for our daily activities. A further differ-

ence is that there are generally more external 

cues available in the case of retrospective 

memory. Finally, as Moscovitch (2008, p. 309) 

pointed out, ÒResearch on prospective memory 

is about the only major enterprise in memory re-

event-based task. About 50% of the rehearsals 
with both tasks occurred automatically (i.e., 

the task simply popped into the participantÕs 

head without any apparent reason) and very 

few (6% with the time-based task and 3% with 

the event-based task) involved deliberate self-

initiated retrieval of the task. Performance was 

better on the event-based task than on the 

time-based task (100% versus 53% reasonably 

punctual phone calls), presumably because the 

text message in the event-based task provided 

a useful external cue.
Hicks, Marsh, and Cook (2005) argued 
that it is too simple to argue that event-based 

tasks are always less demanding than time-

based ones. They hypothesised that the speci-

Þ
 city of the prospective memory task is more 
important than its type (event-based versus 

time-based). In their study, there was a central 

lexical decision task (i.e., deciding as rapidly 

as possible whether each letter string formed 

a word). There were two event-based tasks, 

one of which was well-speciÞ ed (detect the 

words ÒniceÓ and ÒhitÓ) and the other of which 

was ill-speciÞ
 ed (detect animal words). There 
were also two time-based tasks which were 

well-speciÞ
 ed (respond after 4 and 8 minutes) 
or ill-speciÞ ed (respond after"
Segment_559,"3Ð5 minutes   and 7Ð9 minutes). The extent to which these   tasks slowed down performance on the lexical   decision task was taken as a measure of how   demanding they were.

tasks slowed down performance on the lexical 

decision task was taken as a measure of how 

demanding they were.
What did Hicks et al. (2005) Þ nd? First, the 
adverse effects of event-based tasks on lexical 

decision times were less than those of time-based 

tasks (see Figure 8.13). Second, ill-speciÞ
 ed tasks  
(whether event-based or time-based) disrupted 

lexical decision performance more than well-

speciÞ
 ed tasks. Thus, more processing resources 
are required when an individualÕs intentions on 

a prospective memory task are ill-speciÞ
 ed.
Everyday life
Prospective memory is essential in everyday 

life if we are to keep our various social and 

work appointments. How good are we at 

remembering to act on our intentions? Marsh, 
Sellen, Lowie, Harris, and Wilkins (1997) 
compared time-based and event-based prospec-

tive memory in a work environment in which 

participants were equipped with badges con-

taining buttons. They were told to press their 

button at pre-arranged times (time-based task) 

or when in a pre-speciÞ ed place (event-based 

task). Performance was better in the event-

based task than in the time-based task (52% 

versus 33% correct, respectively). Sellen et al. 

argued that event-based prospective memory 

tasks are easier than time-based tasks because 

the intended actions are more likely to be trig-

gered by external cues.
Kim and Mayhorn (2008) compared time-
based and event-based prospective memory in 

naturalistic settings and in the laboratory over 

a one-week period. Event-based prospective 

memory was superior to time-based prospec-

tive memory, especially under laboratory condi-

tions. In addition, there was a general tendency 

for prospective memory to be better under 

naturalistic conditions, perhaps because par-

ticipants were more motivated to remember 

intentions under such conditions than in the 

laboratory. The importance of motivation was"

How similar are the strategies used dur-
ing the retention interval by individuals given 

event- and time-based prospective memory 

tasks? Time-based tasks are more difÞ
 cult than 
event-based ones and often lack external cues. 

As a result, we might imagine that people per-

forming time-based tasks would be more likely 

to use deliberate self-initiated processes to 

rehearse intended actions. In fact, Kvavilashvili 

and Fisher (2007) found the strategies were 

remarkably similar. Participants made a phone 

call at a particular time after an interval of 

one week (time-based task) or as soon as they 

received a certain text message (event-based 

task) which arrived after one week. Participants 

had a mean of nine rehearsals over the week 

with the time-based task and seven with the

Hicks, and Landau (1998) found that people 
reported an average of 15 plans for the forth-

coming week, of which 25% were not completed.  

The main reasons for these non-completions 

were rescheduling and re-prioritisation, with 

only 3% being forgotten.
Evidence that prospective memory is of 
major importance in real life was reported by 

Dismukes and Nowinski (2006) in a study 

on pilot errors. They sampled 20% of all air 

carrier reports submitted to the Aviation Safety 

Reporting System (ASRS) over a one-year period  

to study in detail those involving memory 

failures. Out of 75 incidents or accidents, there 

were failures of prospective memory in 74 cases!

memory because air pilots have excellent

Dismukes and Nowinski (2006) found 
that pilots were most likely to show failures 

of prospective memory if 
interrupted
 while 

carrying out a plan of action. They argued 

that interruptions often occur so rapidly and 

so forcefully that individuals do not think ex-

plicitly about producing a new plan or inten-
tion to deal with the changed situation. Dodhia  

and Dismukes (2005) found that interruptions 

can seriously impair prospective memory. 

Participants answered questions arranged in 

blocks (e.g., vocabulary questions; analogy 

questions). If an interrupting block of questions 

was presented before they had Þ
 nishedanswer-
ing all the questions in a given block, they were 

to return to the interrupted block after com-

pleting the interrupting block.
What did Dodhia and Dismukes (2005)

return to the interrupted block, only 48% of 

the participants resumed the interrupted block 

(see Figure 8.14). Some participants were given 

a reminder lasting four seconds at the time of 

the interruption (ÒPlease remember to return 

to the block that was just interruptedÓ), and 

65% of them resumed the interrupted block. 

However, 65% of participants receiving no 

reminder but who spent four seconds staring 

at a blank screen immediately after being inter-

rupted resumed the interrupted block. In a 

further condition, there was a delay of ten 

seconds between the end of the interrupted 

task and the start of the next block. In this 

condition, 88% of participants resumed the

The above Þ ndings indicate that the provi-
sion of explicit reminders is not always very 

effective when people are interrupted on a task. 

It is important that people have a few seconds 

in which to formulate a new plan when an 

interruption changes the situation. It is also 

important to have a few seconds at the end of 

the interruption to retrieve the intention of 

returning to the interrupted task.
Theoretical perspectives
As we saw in Chapter 6, the working memory 

system is involved in numerous tasks requiring 

people to process and store information at the 

same time. It thus seems likely that it would 

often be involved in the performance of pro-

spective memory tasks. This issue was addressed 

by Marsh and Hicks (1998). Participants per-

formed an event-based prospective memory 

task at the same time as another task requiring 

one of the components of working memory 

(see Chapter 6). A task involving the attention-

like central executive (e.g., random number 
generation) impaired prospective memory per-

formance relative to the control condition. 

However, tasks involving the phonological loop 

or the visuo-spatial sketchpad did not. Thus, 

the prospective memory task used by Marsh 

and Hicks involved the central executive but 

not the other components of the working 

memory system.

Retrospective memory processes that en-
(2) 
sure we remember what action is to be 
performed on the prospective memory 

task.
According to the PAM theory
, performance 
on a prospective memory task should be sup-

erior when participants can devote their full 

attentional resources to it. There is much sup-

port for this prediction. For example, McDaniel, 

Robinson-Riegler, and Einstein (1998) had 

participants perform a prospective memory 

task under full or divided attention. Prospective 

memory performance was much better with 

full attention than with divided attention, indi-

cating that attentional processes were needed 

on the prospective memory task.
Are prospective-memory tasks attentionally 
demanding even during periods of time in 

which no target stimuli are presented? Smith 

(2003) addressed this issue. The main task was 

lexical decision (deciding whether strings of"
Segment_564,"letters form words). The prospective memory   task (performed by half the participants)   involved pressing a button whenever a target   word was presented. When the target word   was not presented, lexical decision was almost   50% slower for those participants per form-  ing the prospective mem",Explores how perception influences cognition.,"memory, awareness, attention",Nested under Chapter on attention,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in awareness,Aligned with contemporary studies on perception,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_506," 

letters form words). The prospective memory 

task (performed by half the participants) 

involved pressing a button whenever a target 

word was presented. When the target word 

was not presented, lexical decision was almost 

50% slower for those participants per
form-

ing the prospective memory task. Thus, a 

prospective memory task can utilise process-

ing resources (and so impair performance on 

another task) even when no target stimuli are 

presented.
In spite of the support for the PAM theory, 
it seems somewhat implausible that we 
always
 

use preparatory attentional processes when 

trying to remember some future action. Indeed, 

there is much evidence that remembering to 

perform a pre-determined action simply ÒpopsÓ 

into our minds. For example, Kvavilashvili and 

Fisher (2007) studied the factors triggering 

rehearsals of a future action on an event-based 

prospective memory task. The overwhelming 

majority of rehearsals (97%) either had no 

obvious trigger or were triggered by some inci-

dental external stimulus or internal thought. 

Reese and Cherry (2002) interrupted parti-

cipants performing a prospective memory task 
to ask them what they were thinking about. 

Only 2% of the time did they report thinking 

about the prospective memory task, which 

seems inconsistent with the notion that we 

maintain preparatory attentional processes.
Smith, Hunt, McVay, and McConnell 
(2007) modiÞ ed their theory somewhat to 

accommodate the above points. They accepted 

that we are not constantly engaged in prepara-

tory attentional processing over long periods 

of time. For example, someone who has the 

intention of buying something at a shop on 

their way home from work will probably not 

use preparatory attentional processing until 

they are in their car ready to drive home. 

However, they argued that retrieval of inten-

tions on prospective memory tasks always 

incurs a cost and is never automatic.
Multi-process theory
Einstei"
Segment_565,"n and McDaniel (2005) put forward a   multi-process theory, according to which vari-  ous cognitive processes (including attentional   processes) can be used to perform prospective   memory tasks. However, the detection of   cues for response will typically be automatic   (and thus not involve atten",Explores how memory influences cognition.,"perception, emotion, recognition",Nested under Chapter on recognition,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in perception,Aligned with contemporary studies on recognition,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_976,"n and McDaniel (2005) put forward a 

multi-process theory, according to which vari-

ous cognitive processes (including attentional 

processes) can be used to perform prospective 

memory tasks. However, the detection of 

cues for response will typically be automatic 

(and thus not involve attentional processes) 

when some or all of the following criteria are 

fulÞ lled:
The cue and the to-be-performed target 
(1) 
action are highly associated.

The cue is conspicuous or salient.
(2) 
The ongoing processing on another task 
(3) 
being performed at the same time as the 

prospective memory task directs attention  

to the relevant aspects of the cue.

The intended action is simple.
(4) 
The processing demands of prospective 
memory tasks often depend on the four factors 

identiÞ
 ed above (see Einstein & McDaniel, 
2005, for a review). However
, even prospective 
memory tasks that theoretically should be per-

formed automatically and without monitoring 

nevertheless involve processing costs. Einstein 

et al. (2005) investigated this issue. Particip-

ants received sentences such as the following:

Just over half of the participants performed

Einstein et al. (2005) compared the PAM 
and multi-process theories further in another

A target item was presented for the pro-

Seven items were rated for imagery.
(2) 
Lexical decisions (word versus non-word) 
(3) 
were made for 18 items.

Seven additional items were rated for 
(4) 
imagery
.
Participants pressed a key whenever they 

detected the target word (prospective memory 

task) while performing the imagery rating task. 

However (and this is crucial), participants were
 
told to ignore the prospective memory task 

while performing the lexical-decision task.
What happened when the target word from 
the prospective memory task was presented 

during the lexical-decision task? According to 

the PAM theory, participants should not have 

engaged in deliberate monitoring, and so the 

target word should not have disrupted perfor-

mance on the lexical-decision task. According 

to the multi-process theory, in contrast, the 

target word should have activated automatic 

processes, which would produce disruption of 
lexical-decision performance. The Þ
 ndings 
favoured the multi-process view.
Smith et al. (2007) argued that the Þ
 ndings 
reported by Einstein et al. (2005) were not 

convincing because of limitations of experi-

mental design and the small size of some of 

their effects. They pointed out that no previous 

experiments fulÞ lled all four of the criteria for 

automaticity. Accordingly, they carried out an 

experiment in which the criteria were all satis-

Þ
 ed. Their prospective memory task involved 
pressing the ÒPÓ key on a keyboard when a 

pink stimulus was presented. In spite of the 

simplicity of this task, it had a disruptive effect 

on performance speed of the central task being 

carried out at the same time. This finding

In sum, successful performance of prospec-
tive memory tasks often involves extensive 

monitoring, and this seems to be the case even 

when all of the theoretical criteria for auto-

matic processing are present (Smith et al., 

2007). However, monitoring is less likely when 

people remember intentions over long periods 

of time (as often happens in real life) than over 

short periods of time (as in the laboratory). As 

assumed by multi-process theory, the processes 

we use on prospective memory tasks vary 

between those that are very demanding (e.g., 

monitoring) and those imposing very few 

demands depending upon the precise task re-

quirements. However, it remains a matter of 

controversy whether intentions on prospective 

memory tasks can ever be retrieved automatic-

ally with no processing cost.
Cognitive neuroscience
Which parts of the brain are most important 

in prospective memory? The notion that pro-

spective memory consists of Þ ve stages suggests 

that several brain areas should be involved. 

However, most research focus has been on the 

frontal lobes, which are known to be involved 

in many executive functions (see Chapter 6).

problems with prospective memory, Þ

that various frontal regions were damaged. 

They argued that the right dorsolateral pre-

frontal cortex is involved in planning and the 

creation of intentions. BA10 (also known as 

rostral prefrontal cortex), which is located just 

behind the forehead, is involved in the main-

tenance of intentions. In contrast, the retro-

spective memory component of prospective 

memory tasks (i.e., remembering whic"

Burgess et al. (2000) argued that BA10 is the 
area of greatest relevance to prospective mem-

ory. It is a large and somewhat mysterious area. 

It is mysterious in the sense that damage to 

this area often seems to have remarkably little 

effect on tests of intelligence, language, mem-

ory, or many types of problem solving. Burgess 

et al. suggested a solution to the mystery. 

According to their 
gateway hypothesis
, ÒBA10 
supports a mechanism that enables us to either 

maintain thoughts in our head . . . while doing 

something else, or switch between the thoughts 

in our head and attending to events in the 

environment . . . [it acts] as an attentional gate-

way between inner mental life and the external 

world as experienced through the sensesÓ 

(p. 251). Most prospective memory tasks in-

volve switching between external stimuli and 

internal thoughts, and so it follows from the 

gateway hypothesis that BA10 should be acti-

vated during prospective memory tasks.
The gateway hypothesis was tested by 
Gilbert, Frith, and Burgess (2005). Participants 

performed a task either Òin their headsÓ or 

with the task stimuli present. There was BA10 

activation when participants switched between 

the two ways of performing the task. Okuda 

et al. (2007) found that there was activation 

in BA10 in both time- and event-based prospec-

tive memory tasks but the precise pattern of 

activation varied between the two tasks.
Gilbert, Spengler, Simons, Frith, and Burgess 
(2006) carried out a meta-analysis of over 100 

studies on BA10 activations. They identiÞ
 ed the 
regions within BA10 associated with three pro-
cesses of relevance to prospective memory. First, 

episodic memory retrieval was associated with 

lateral BA10 activations. Second, co-ordinating 

two processing demands involved very anterior

The available research indicates that BA10 
is involved when people retain and act on 

intentions over short periods of time. Sometimes 

we need to store information about intended 

actions over long periods of time, and it is 

implausible that BA10 is involved in such stor-

age. Thus, a complete neuroscience account of 

prospective memory would need to include a 

consideration of the brain areas in which inten-

tions are stored.
Evaluation
Research interest in prospective memory started 

fairly recently, and the progress since then has 

been impressive in several ways. First, we have 

a reasonable understanding of the similarities 

and differences between event- and time-based 

prospective memory. Second, there is real-

world evidence that serious failures of prospec-

tive memory are more likely when someone is 

interrupted while carrying out a plan of action. 

Third, we are beginning to understand the roles 

of attentional, monitoring, and automatic pro-

cesses in prospective memory. Fourth, the ways 

in which the prefrontal cortex is involved in 

prospective memory are becoming clearer.
What are the limitations of research on 
prospective memory? First, in the real world, 

we typically form intentions to perform some 
gateway hypothesis:
 the assumption that 
BA10 in the prefrontal cortex acts as an 

attentional gateway between our internal 

thoughts and external stimuli.

future action because we hope to achieve some 
goal (e.g., establishing a friendship with some-

one). In contrast, as Gollwitzer and Cohen 

(2008, p. 438) pointed out, ÒMost laboratory 

prospective memory studies involve instruc-

tions that are fairly arbitrary with no clearly

Segment_570,"ed goal.Ó As a result, many participants  in laboratory studies may exhibit poor prospec-  tive memory mainly because they lack any real   incentive to remember to perform intended   actions as instructed by the experimenter.

in laboratory studies may exhibit poor prospec-

tive memory mainly because they lack any real 

incentive to remember to perform intended

Second, it is sometimes assumed too readily 
that the processes involved in prospective mem-

ory are very different from those involved in 

retrospective memory. In fact, there is evid 
ence 
for a general memory factor including both pro-

spec
tive and retrospective memory (Crawford, 

Smith, Maylor, Della Sala, & Logie, 2003). Pro-

spective and retro spective memory seem to share 

some common features (e.g., responding in the 

light of what has been learned previously), and 
many prospective memory tasks clearly also 

involve retro spective memory. Thus, we need 

more focus on the similarities as well as the 

differences between the two types of memory.
Third, it is generally accepted that pro-
spective memory involves several stages such 

as encoding, retention, retrieval, execution, 

and evaluation. However, much research fails 

to distinguish clearly among these stages. For 

example, failures of prospective memory are 

often attributed to retrieval failure without con-

sidering the possibility of execution failure.
Fourth, a Þnal weakness is that the great 
majority of studies of prospective memory have 

used relatively short retention intervals between 

the establishment of a prospective memory and 

the circumstances in which it should be used. 

Attentional and monitoring processes are likely 

to be more important (and long-term memory 

much less important) when the retention inter-

val is short than when it is long.
Introduction

menterÕs demands for accuracy, whereas what we remember in everyday life is determined

by our personal goals. All kinds of memory research should strive for ecological validity,

cross-fertilisation between them.
Autobiographicalmemory
†
There is overlap between autobiographical and episodic memories, but the former tend to
have greater personal signiÞ
 cance. Odours can provide powerful retrieval cues for long-
distant autobiographical memories (the Proust phenomenon). Flashbulb memories often

seem to be unusually vivid and accurate, but actually show poor consistency and accuracy.

Childhood amnesia occurs because the cognitive self only emerges towards the end of the

second year of life and its extent depends on social and cultural factors and infantsÕ develop-

ment of
 
language. The reminiscence bump consists mainly of positive memories involving
high perceived control associated with progress in life. According to Conway (2005), auto-

biographical information is stored hierarchically at four levels: themes, lifetime periods,

general events, and episodic memories. Conway also argues that the goals of the working

self inß uence the storage and retrieval of autobiographical memories. Most recall of auto-

biographical memories involves the control processes of the working self within the frontal

lobes, followed by activation of parts of the knowledge base in more posterior regions.

source misattribution), blending of information, and response bias. Culprits are more

likely to be selected from simultaneous than from sequential line-ups but there are more

false alarms when the culprit is absent with simultaneous line-ups. The cognitive interview

(based on the assumptions that memory traces are complex and can be accessed in vari-

ous ways) leads eyewitnesses to produce many more accurate memories at the expense

of a small increase in inaccurate memories.
Prospective memory
†
Prospective memory involves successive stages of encoding, retention, retrieval, execution,
and evaluation, and it can be event- or time-based. Event-based prospective memory is

often better because the intended actions are more likely to be triggered by external cues.

Many prospective memory failures occur when individuals are interrupted while carrying

out a plan of action and have insufÞ cient time to form a new plan. Some theorists argue

that people always use a capacity-consuming monitoring process during the retention

interval and that the retrieval of intentions always requires some capacity. Others claim

that the involvement of attention and /or automatic processes depends on the nature of

the cue and the task in prospective memory. Evidence from brain-damaged patients and

from functional neuroimaging indicates that the frontal lobes have a central role in pro-

spective memory. Several processes (e.g., episodic memory retrieval, co-ordination of task

demands, and self-reß 
ection) of relevance to prospective memory involve BA10 within
the prefrontal cortex.

We are con-

of previous generations because knowledge 

is passed on from one generation to the next 

via language.
What is language? According to Harley 
(2008, p. 5), language ﬁis a system of symbols 

and rules that enable us to communicate. 

Symbols are things that stand for other things: 

Words, either written or spoken, are symbols. 

The rules specify how words are ordered to 

form sentences.ﬂ It is true that communication 

is the primary function of language, but it is 

not the only one. Crystal (1997) identi˚
 ed eight 
functions of language, of which communica-

tion was one. In addition, we can use language 

for thinking, to record information, to express 

emotion (e.g., ﬁI love youﬂ), to pretend to 

be animals (e.g., ﬁWoof! Woof!ﬂ), to express 

identity with a group (e.g., singing in church), 

and so on.
Can other species acquire language? The 
most important research here has involved 

trying to teach language to apes. Some of 

the most impressive evidence came from the 

research of Savage-Rumbaugh with a bonobo 

chimpanzee called Panbanisha (see Leake, 1999), 

who was born in 1985. Panbanisha has spent 

her entire life in captivity receiving training in 

the use of language. She uses a specially designed 

keypad with about 400 geometric patterns, or 
lexigrams, on it. When she presses a sequence 

of keys, a computer translates the sequence 

into a synthetic voice. Panbanisha learned a 

vocabulary of 3000 words by the age of 14 years, 

and became very good at combining a series 

of symbols in the grammatically correct order. 

For example, she can construct sentences such 

as, ﬁPlease can I have an iced coffee?ﬂ, and, 

ﬁI™m thinking about eating something.ﬂ
Panbanisha™s achievements are considerable. 
However, her command of language is much 

less than that of young children. For example, 

she does not produce many novel sentences, she 

only rarely refers to objects that"
Segment_575,"are not visible,   and the complexity of her sentences is generally   less than that of children.

IS LANGUAGE INNATE?
There has been ˚
 erce controversy over the 
years concerning 
the extent to which language 
is innate. A key ˚ gure in this controversy is 

Chomsky (1965). He argued that humans pos-

sess a language acquisition device consisting 

of innate knowledge of grammatical structure. 

Children require some exposure to (and experi-

ence with) the language environment provided

groups almost completely lacking in exposure to  
a developed language was reported by Senghas,  

Kita, and Özyürek (2004). They studied deaf 

Nicaraguan children at special schools. Attempts 

(mostly unsuccessful) were made to teach them  

Spanish. However, these deaf children developed  

a new system of gestures that expanded into 

a basic sign language passed on to successive 

groups of children who joined the school. 

Since Nicaraguan Sign Language bore very 

little relation 
to Spanish or to the gestures 
made by hearing children, it appears that it is 

a genuinely new language owing remarkably 

little to other languages.
What do the above ˚ ndings mean? They 
certainly suggest that humans have a strong 

innate motivation to acquire language (including 

grammatical rules) and to communicate with 

others. However, the ˚
 ndings do 
not
 provide 
strong support for the notion of a language 

acquisition device.
The genetic approach is another way of 
showing that innate factors are important in 

language (see Grigorenko"
Segment_576,", 2009, for a review).   There are huge individual differences in language   ability, some of which depend on genetic factors.

There are huge individual differences in language 

ability, some of which depend on genetic factors. 

Of particular importance is research on the KE 

family in London. Across three generations of 

this family, about 50% of its members suffer 

from severe language problems (e.g., dif˚
 culties  
in understanding speech, slow and ungram-

matical speech, and a poor ability to decide 

whether sentences are grammatical).
Detailed genetic research indicated that the 
complex language disorder found in members 

of the KE family was controlled by a speci˚
 c 
gene named FOXP2 (Lai, Fisher, Hurst, Vargha-

Khadem, & Monaco, 2001). More speci˚
 cally, 
mutations of this gene were found in affected 

members of the family but not in unaffected 

members. In a subsequent study on other patients 

with similar language problems (MacDermot 

et al., 2005), other mutations of FOXP2 were 

discovered.
What is the role of FOXP2 in language? 
It is probably involved in the brain mechanisms 

underlying the development of language. The 

fact that affected members of the KE family 
by their parents and other people to develop 

language. Such experience determines 
which
 

speci˚
 c language any given child will learn.
One of the reasons why Chomsky put 
forward the notion of a language acquisition 

device was that he was so impressed by the 

breathtaking speed with which most young 

children acquire language. From the age of 

about 16 months onwards, children often acquire 

upwards of ten new words every day. By the 

age of ˚ ve, children have mastered most of the 

grammatical rules of their native language.
It should be pointed out that many experts 
regard the entire notion of an innate grammar 

as implausible. For example, Bishop (1997, 

p. 123) argued as follows: ﬁWhat makes an innate

grammar a particularly peculiar idea is the fact 

that innate knowledge must be general enough 

to account for acquisition of Italian, Japanese, 

Turki"

Bickerton (1984) put forward the language  
bioprogramme hypothesis, which is closely 

related to Chomsky™s views. According to this 

hypothesis, children will create a grammar even 

if not exposed to a proper language during their 

early years. Some of the strongest support for 

this hypothesis comes from the study of pidgin 

languages. These are new, primitive languages 

created when two or more groups of people 

having different native languages are in contact 

with each other. Pinker (1984) discussed research 

on labourers from China, Japan, Korea, Puerto 

Rico, Portugal, and the Philippines who were 

taken to the sugar plantations of Hawaii 100 

years ago. These labourers developed a pidgin 

language that was very simple and lacked most 

grammatical structures. Here is an example: 

ﬁMe cape buy, me check make.ﬂ The meaning 

is, ﬁHe bought my coffee; he made me out 

a cheque.ﬂ The offspring of these labourers 

developed a language known as Hawaiian 

Creole, which is a proper language and fully 

grammatical.
We do not know the extent to which the 
development of Hawaiian Creole depended 

on the labourers™ prior exposure to language. 

Clearer evidence that a language can develop in

˚
 nd it dif˚ cult to control their tongues and to 
make speech sounds suggests that the gene may 
be relevant to precise movements within the 

articulatory system. However, we must not 

exaggerate the importance of FOXP2. Studies on  

individuals suffering from a range of language 

disorders more common than those experienced 

by members of the KE family have consistently 

failed to ˚ nd evidence of the involvement of 

FOXP2 in those disorders (Grigorenko, 2009).

WHORFIAN HYPOTHESIS
The best-known theory about the interrelation-

ship between language and thought was put 

forward by Benjamin Lee Whorf (1956). He 

was a ˚ re prevention of˚ cer for an insurance 

company who spent his spare time working 

in linguistics. According to his hypothesis of 

linguistic relativity (the 
WhorÞ an hypothesis
), 

language determines or in˜
 uences thinking. 
Miller and McNeill (1969) distinguished three 

versions of the Whor˚ an hypothesis. According 

to the strong hypothesis, language determines 

thinking. Thus, any language imposes constraints 

on what can be thought, with those constraints 

varying from one language to another. The 

weak hypothesis states that language in˜
 uences 
perception. Finally, the weakest hypothesis 

claims only that language in˜
 uences memory.
Evidence
Casual inspection of the world™s languages 

indicates signi˚ cant differences among them. 

For example, the Hanuxoo people in the 
Philippines have 92 different names for various 

types of rice, and there are hundreds of camel-

related words in Arabic. These differences may 

in˜
 uence thought. However, it is more plausible 
that different environmental conditions in˜
 uence 
the things people think about, and this in turn 

in˜
 uences their linguistic usage. Thus, these 
differences occur because thought in˜
 uences 
language rather than because language in˜
 uences 
thought.
According to the Whor˚ an hypothesis, colour 
categorisation and memory should vary as a 

function of the participants™ native language.

What did Roberson et al. (2000) ˚
 nd? 
Language determined performance: both groups 

showed categorical perception based on their 

own language (see Figure III.1). This is good 

support for the Whor˚ an hypothesis. In another 

study, Roberson et al. studied the effects of 

categorical perception on memory. Participants 

decided on a test of recognition memory which 

of two test stimuli matched a target stimulus 

that had been presented previously. According 

to the Whor˚ an hypothesis, English speakers 

should have had good recognition memory 

when the test stimuli were on opposite sides 

of the greenŒblue boundary, but this should 

have been irrelevant to the Berinmo. In con-

trast, Berinmo speakers should have performed  
well when the test stimuli were on opposite 

sides of the nolŒwor boundary, but this should 

have been irrelevant to the English participants. 

All these predictions were supported.
It could be argued that at least some of the 
˚
 ndings obtained from the Berinmo were due to  
their lack of experience with man-made colours 

rather than their limited colour vocabulary. 

However, this explanation does not account for  

˚
 ndings from a study on Russian participants 
(Winawer, Witthoft, Frank, Wade, & Boroditsky, 

2007). The Russian language is unique in that 

it has separate words for dark blue (siniy) and 

light blue (goluboy). Winawer et al. carried out 

a study in which Russian participants had to 

select which of two test colours matched a siniy 

(dark blue) target that remained visible. There 

was clear evidence of categorical perception 

Œthe participants performed faster when the

English there is a stereotype of the artistic type

lifestyle), but this stereotype does not exist in 

Chinese. Bilinguals thinking in Chinese used

how long it had been on the screen. The length 

of the line was unrelated to its duration. On

but not by distance, because they naturally 

think of duration in terms of amount. All these 

predictions were supported by the ˚
 ndings.
Evaluation
Recent years have seen increased support for 

the Whor˚ an hypothesis on several kinds of task 

(e.g., colour discrimination; colour memory; 

temporal estimation). The available evidence 

supports the weakest and the weak versions of 

the Whor˚ an hypothesis. When tasks are used 

giving participants ˜ exibility in the approach 

they adopt (e.g., Hoffman et al., 1986), there 

is even modest evidence favouring the strong 

version of the hypothesis.
What is lacking is a detailed speci˚
 cation 
of the ways in which language in˜
 uences cogni-
tion. Hunt and Agnoli (1991) assumed that 

an individual™s estimate of computational costs 

or mental effort helps to determine whether 

language in˜ uences cognition. However, these 

costs have rarely been assessed.
It is important to establish whether the 
limiting effects of language on cognition are 

relatively easy to remove. Whorf (1956) assumed 

that it would be hard to change the effects 

of language on cognition, whereas Hunt and 

Agnoli (1991) assumed that it would be rela-
tively easy. Only future research will provide 

the answer.
LANGUAGE CHAPTERS

to speech, reading, speaking, and writing). It

ungrammatical) letters in French. However, in 

common with many British people, he ˚

it agonisingly dif˚ cult to understand rapid 

spoken French, and his ability to speak French 

is poor.
The next three chapters (Chapters 9 Œ11) 
focus on the four main language skills. Chapter  

10 deals with the basic processes involved in 

reading and in listening to speech. There is an 

emphasis in this chapter on the ways in which 

readers and listeners identify and make sense 

of individual words that they read on the 

printed page or hear in speech. As we will see, 

the study of brain-damaged patients has helped 

to reveal the complexity of the processes under-

lying reading and speech recognition.
Chapter 10 is concerned mainly with the 
processes involved in the comprehension of 

sentences and discourse (connected text or 

speech). There are some important differences 

between understanding text and understanding 

speech (e.g., it is generally easier to refer back 

to what has gone before with text than with 

speech). However, it is assumed that compre-

hension processes are broadly similar for text 

and for speech, and major theories of language 

comprehension are considered in detail.
Chapter 11 deals with the remaining two 
main language abilities: speaking and writing.

CHAPTER

READING AND SPEECH 
PERCEPTION
which listening to speech can be easier than 
reading. Speech often contains prosodic cues 

(discussed in Chapter 11; see Glossary). Prosodic 

cues are hints to sentence structure and intended  

meaning via the speaker™s pitch, intonation, 

stress, and timing (e.g., questions have a rising 

intonation on the last word in the sentence). 

In contrast, the main cues to sentence structure 

speci˚
 c to text are punctuation marks (e.g., 
commas, semi-colons). These are often less 

informative than prosodic cues in speech.
The fact that reading and listening to speech 
differ considerably can be seen by considering 

children and brain-damaged patients. Young 

children often have good comprehension of 

spoken language, but struggle to read even simple 

stories. Part of the reason may be that reading 

is a relatively recent invention in our evolutionary 

history, and so lacks a genetically programmed 

specialised processor (McCandliss, Cohen, & 

Dehaene, 2003). Some adult brain-damaged 

patients 
can understand spoken language but 
cannot read, and others can read perfectly well 

but cannot understand the spoken word.
Basic processes speci˚ c to reading are dealt 
with ˚ rst in this chapter. These processes are 

involved in recognising and reading individual 

words and in guiding our eye movements 

during reading. After that, we consider basic 

"

INTRODUCTION
Humanity excels in its command of language. 

Indeed, language is of such enormous impor-

tance that this chapter and the following two 

are devoted to it. In this chapter, we consider 

the basic processes involved in reading words 

and in recognising spoken words. It often does 

not matter whether a message is presented to 

our eyes or to our ears. For example, you would 

understand the sentence, ﬁYou have done 

exceptionally well in your cognitive psychology 

examinationﬂ, in much the same way whether 

you read or heard it. Thus, many comprehension 

processes are very similar whether we are read-

ing a text or listening to someone talking.
However, reading and speech perception 
differ in various ways. In reading, each word 

can be seen as a whole, whereas a spoken word 

is spread out in time and is transitory. More 

importantly, it is much harder to tell where 

one word ends and the next starts with speech 

than with text. Speech generally provides a 

more ambiguous signal than does printed text. 

For example, when words were spliced out of 

spoken sentences and presented on their own, 

they were recognised only half of the time 

(Lieberman, 1963).
There are other signi˚
 cant differences. The 
demands on memory are greater when listening 

to speech than reading a text, because the words 

already spoken are no longer accessible. So far we 

have indicated ways in which listening to speech  

is harder. However, there is one major way in

READING: INTRODUCTION
It is important to study reading because adults 

without effective reading skills are at a great 

disadvantage. Thus, we need to understand the 

processes involved in reading to help poor readers. 

In addition, reading requires several perceptual 

and other cognitive processes as well as a good 

knowledge of language and of grammar. Thus, 

reading can be regarded as visually guided 

thinking.
Research methods
Several methods are available for studying read-

ing. These methods have been used extensively 

in research, and so it is important to understand  

what they involve as well as their limitations. 

For example, consider ways of assessing the time 

taken for word identi˚ cation or recognition 

(e.g., deciding a word is familiar; accessing its 

meaning). The 
lexical decision task
 involves 

deciding rapidly whether a string of letters forms 

a word. The 
naming task
 involves saying a 

printed 
word out loud as rapidly as possible. 
These techniques ensure certain pro 
cessing has 
been performed but possess clear limitations. 

Normal reading times are disrupted by the require-

ment to respond to the task, and it is hard to 

know precisely what processes are re˜
 ected in 
lexical decision or naming times.
Recording eye movements during reading is  
useful. It provides an unobtrusive and detailed 

on-line record of attention-related processes. The 

only important restriction on readers whose eye 

movements are being recorded is that they must 

keep their heads fairly still. The main problem 

is the dif˚ culty of deciding precisely 
what
 pro-

cessing occurs during each ˚
 xation (period of 
time during which the eye remains still).
Balota, Paul, and Spieler (1999) argued that 
reading involves several kinds of processing: 

orthography
 (the spelling of words); 
phono"
Segment_587,"logy   (the sound of words);  semantics  (word mean-  ing); syntax; and higher-level discourse integra-  tion. The various tasks differ in the involvement   of these kinds of processing: In naming, the attentional control system   would increase the inß uence of the  computations between orthography",Explores how perception influences cognition.,"memory, recognition, awareness",Nested under Chapter on perception,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in awareness,Aligned with contemporary studies on attention,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_110,"logy
 
(the sound of words); 
semantics
 (word mean-

ing); syntax; and higher-level discourse integra-

tion. The various tasks differ in the involvement 

of these kinds of processing:
In naming, the attentional control system 

would increase the inß uence of the 
computations between orthography and 

phonology . . . the 
demands of lexical 
decision performance might place a high 

priority on the computations between 

orthographic and meaning level modules 

[processors] . . . if the goal . . . is reading 

comprehension, then attentional control 

would increase the priority of 

computations of the syntactic-, meaning-, 

and discourse-level modules (p. 47).
Thus, performance on naming and lexical 

decision tasks may not re˜ ect accurately normal
 
reading processes.
Next, there is 
priming
, in which a prime 
word is presented very shortly before the tar-

get word. The prime word is related to the 

target word (e.g., in spelling, meaning, or sound).  

What is of interest is to see the effects of 

the prime on processing of (and response to) the 

target word. For example, when reading the 
lexical decision task:
 a task in which 
individuals decide as rapidly as possible whether 

a letter string forms a word.

naming task:
 a task in which visually presented 

words are pronounced aloud as rapidly as possible.

orthography:
 information about the spellings 

of words.

phonology:
 information about the sounds of 

words and parts of words.

semantics: 
the meaning conveyed by words and 
sentences.

priming:
 inß uencing the processing of (and 

response to) a target by presenting a stimulus 

related to it in some way beforehand.

Finally, there is brain imaging. In recent 
years, there has been increasing interest in iden-

tifying the brain areas associated with various 

language processes. Some of the fruits of such 

research will be discussed in this chapter and 

the next two.
Phonological processes in reading
You are currently reading this sentence. Did 

you access the relevant sounds when identifying 

the words in the previous sentence? The most 

common view (e.g., Coltheart, Rastle, Perry, 

Langdon, & Ziegler, 2001) is that phonological 

processing of visual words is relatively slow 

and inessential for word identi˚
 cation. This 
view (the weak phonological model) differs 

from the strong phonological model in which 

phonology has a much more central role:
A phonological representation is a 

necessary product of processing printed 

words, even though the explicit 
pronunciation of their phonological 

structure is not required. Thus, the 

strong phonological model would 

predict that phonological processing will 

be mandatory [obligatory], perhaps 

automatic (Frost, 1998, p. 76).
Evidence
The assumption that phonological processing 

is important when identifying words was sup-

ported by van Orden (1987). Some of the words 

he used were 
homophones
 (words having one 

pronunciation but two spellings). Participants  

made many errors when asked questions such 

as, ﬁIs it a ˜
 ower? ROWSﬂ, than when asked, 
ﬁIs it a ˜ ower? ROBSﬂ. The problem with 

ﬁROWSﬂ is that it is homophonic with ﬁROSEﬂ, 

which of course is a ˜ ower. The participants 

made errors because they engaged in phono-

logical processing of the words.
We now move on to the notion of phono-
logical neighbourhood. Two words are phono-

logical neighbours if they differ in only one 

phoneme (e.g., ﬁgateﬂ has ﬁbaitﬂ and ﬁgetﬂ as 

neighbours"
Segment_589,"). If phonology is used in visual word   recognition, then words with many phonological    neighbours should have an advantage. Yates   (2005) found support for this assumption using   various tasks (e.g., lexical decision; naming).   Within sentences, words having many phono-  logical neighbours ar",Explores how awareness influences cognition.,"recognition, attention, perception",Nested under Chapter on emotion,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in awareness,Aligned with contemporary studies on memory,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_698,"). If phonology is used in visual word 

recognition, then words with many phonological  

neighbours should have an advantage. Yates 

(2005) found support for this assumption using 

various tasks (e.g., lexical decision; naming). 

Within sentences, words having many phono-

logical neighbours are ˚ xated for less time than 

those with few neighbours (Yates, Friend, & 

Ploetz, 2008).
Many researchers have used masked phono-
logical priming to assess the role of phonology 

in word processing (mentioned earlier). A word  

(e.g., ﬁclipﬂ) is immediately preceded by a phono-

logically identical non-word prime (e.g., ﬁklipﬂ). 

This prime is masked and presented very brie˜
 y 
so it is not consciously perceived. Rastle and 

Brysbaert (2006) carried out a meta-analysis. 
Reading is a complex skill. It involves processing 
information about word spellings, the sounds of 

words, and the meanings of words, as well as 

higher-level comprehension processes.
homophones:
 words having the same 
pronunciations but that differ in the way they 

are spelled.

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
Words were processed faster on various tasks 
(e.g., lexical decision task; naming task) when 

preceded by such primes than by primes similar 

to them in terms of spelling but not phonology 

(e.g., ﬁplipﬂ). These ˚ ndings strongly imply 

that phonological processing occurs rapidly 

and 
automatically, as predicted by the strong 
phonological model. However, ˚
 ndings with 
masked phonological priming do not prove 

that visual word recognition 
must
 depend on 

prior phonological processing.
In a study on proof-reading and eye move-
ments, Jared, Levy, and Rayner (1999) found

ﬂ) than when they were correct 
(e.g., ﬁHe was in his stocking 
feet
ﬂ). That would 
not have happened if the phonological code 

had been accessed before word meaning. How-

ever, there were many backward eye movements 

(regressions) after incorrect homophones had 

been ˚ xated. These ˚ ndings suggest that the 

phonological code may be accessed 
after
 word 

meaning is accessed.
Reasonably convincing evidence that word 
meaning can be accessed without access to pho-

nology was reported by Hanley and McDonnell 

(1997). They studied a patient, PS, who under-

stood the meanings of words while reading even 

though he could not pronounce them accurately. 

PS did not even seem to have access to an internal 

phonological representation of words. He could 

not gain access to the other meaning of homo-

phones when he saw one of the spellings (e.g., 

ﬁairﬂ). The fact that PS could give accurate de˚
 ni-
tions of printed words in spite of his impairments  

suggests strongly that he had full access to the 
meanings of words for which he could not 

supply the appropriate phonology.
One way of ˚ nding out when phonological 
processing occurs is to use event-related poten-

tials (ERPs; see Glossary). When Ashby and 

Martin (2008) did this, they found that syllable 

information in visually presented words was 

processed 250 Œ350 ms after word onset. This 

is rapidly enough to in˜
 uence visual word 
recognition.
Evaluation
Phonological processing typically occurs 

rapidly and automatically during visual word 

recognition. Thus, the weak phon"

may have underestimated the importance of 

phonological processing. As Rastle and Brysbaert 

(2006) pointed out, the fact that we develop 

phonological representations years before we 

learn to read may help to explain why pho-

n o logy is so important.
What are the limitations of the strong phono-
logical model? There is as yet little compelling 

evidence that phonological information has to 

be used in visual word recognition. In 
several  

studies (e.g., Hanley & McDonnell, 1997; 
Jared 
et al., 1999), evidence of phonological processing  

was limited or absent. There is also phonological 

dyslexia (discussed in detail shortly). Phono-

logical dyslexics have great dif˚
 culties with 
phonological processing but can nevertheless read 

familiar words. This is somewhat puzzling if 

phonological processing is essential for reading. 

Even when there is clear evidence of phonological 

processing, this processing may occur after 

accessing word meaning (Daneman et al., 1995).
In sum, the strong phonological model is 
probably too strong. However, phonological 

processing often plays an important role in visual 

word recognition even if word recognition can 

occur in its absence.
WORD RECOGNITION
College students typically read at about 300 

words per minute, thus averaging only 200 ms 

to recognise each word. How long does word

recognition take? That is hard to say, in part 
because of imprecision about the meaning 

of ﬁword recognitionﬂ. The term can refer to 

deciding that a word is familiar, accessing a 

word™s name, or accessing its meaning. We will 

see that various estimates of the time taken for 

word recognition have been produced.
Automatic processing
Rayner and Sereno (1994) argued that word 

recognition is generally fairly automatic. This 

makes intuitive sense given tha"
Segment_592,t most college   students have read between 20 and 70 million   words in their lifetimes. It has been argued   that automatic processes are unavoidable and   unavailable to consciousness (see Chapter 5).

words in their lifetimes. It has been argued 

that automatic processes are unavoidable and 

unavailable to consciousness (see Chapter 5). 

Evidence that word identi˚
 cation may be 
unavoidable in some circumstances comes from  

the Stroop effect
 
(see Glossary), in which naming 
the colours in which words are printed is 

slowed when the words themselves are different 

colour names (e.g., the word RED printed in 

green). The Stroop effect suggests that word 

meaning can be extracted even when people 

try 
not
 to process it. Cheesman and Merikle 
(1984) found that the Stroop effect could be 

obtained even when the colour name was pre-

sented below the level of conscious awareness. 

This latter ˚ nding suggests that word recognition 

or identi˚ cation does not necessarily depend 

on conscious awareness.
Letter and word processing
It could be argued that the recognition of a 

word on the printed page involves two 
successive
 
stages:
Identi˚
 cation of the individual letters in 
(1) 
the word.

Word identi˚
 cation.
(2) 
In fact, however, the notion that letter identi˚
 ca-
tion must be complete before word identi˚
 ca-
tion can begin is wrong. For example, consider 
the 
word superiority effect
 (Reicher, 1969). A
 
letter string is presented very brie˜
 y, followed 
by a pattern mask. Participants decide which 

of two letters was presented in a particular 

position (e.g., the third letter). The word su-

periority effect is de˚ ned by the ˚
 nding that 
performance is better when the letter string 

forms a word than when it does not.
The word superiority effect suggests that in-
formation about the word presented can facili-

tate identi˚
 cation of the letters of that word. 
However, there is also a pseudoword superiority 

effect: letters are better recognised 
when presented  

in 
pseudowords
 (pronounceable 
nonwords such 
as ﬁMAVEﬂ) than in unpronounceable non-

words (Carr,

Interactive activation model
McClelland and Rumelhart (1981) proposed 

an in˜ uential interactive activation model of 

visual word processing to account for the word  

superiority effect. It was based on the assump-

tion that bottom-up and top-down processes 

interact (see Figure 9.1):
There are recognition units at three levels:
¥
the feature level at the bottom; the letter

level in the middle; and the word level at

the top.

When a feature in a letter is detected (e.g.,
¥
vertical line at the right-hand side of a

letter), activation goes to all letter units

containing that feature (e.g., H, M, N), and

inhibition goes to all other letter units.

Letters are identi˚ ed at the letter level. When
¥
a letter within a word is identi˚
 ed, activation
is sent to the word level for all four-letter

word units containing that letter in that

position within the word, and inhibition is

sent to all other word units.
word superiority effect:
 a target letter is 
more readily detected in a letter string when 

the string forms a word than when it does not.

According to the model, top-down process-
ing is involved in the activation and inhibition 

processes going from the word level to the

because of top-down in˜ 
uences of the word 
level on the letter level. Suppose the word SEAT

How can the pseudoword superiority effect 
be explained? When letters are embedded in 

pronounceable nonwords, there will generally 

be some overlap of spelling patterns between 

the pseudoword and genuine words. This over-

lap can produce additional activation of the 

letters presented in the pseudoword and lead 

to the pseudoword superiority effect.
According to the model, time to identify a 
word depends in part on its 
orthographic
 
neigh-
bours
, the words that can be formed by changing 
just one of its letters. Thus, for example, the word 

ﬁstemﬂ has words including ﬁseemﬂ, ﬁstepﬂ, and 

ﬁstewﬂ as orthographic neighbours. When a word 

is presented, these orthographic 
neighbours be-

come activated and increase the time taken to 

identify it. Theoretically, this inhibitory effect is  

especially great when a word™s orthographic neigh-

bours are higher in frequency in the language 

than the word itself. This is because high-frequency 

words (words encountered frequently in our 

everyday lives) have greater resting activation 

levels than low-frequency ones. It has proved very  

dif˚
 cult to ˚ nd this predicted inhibitory effect 
of higher frequency neighbours in studies using 

English words (e.g., Sears, Campbell, & Lupker, 

2006). Interestingly, there is much stronger evid-

ence for an 
inhibitory effect in other languages 
(e.g., French, Dutch, Spanish; see Sears et al., 2006, 

f or a review). English has many more short words 

with several higher frequency neighbours than 

these other languages. As a result, inhibitory 

effects in English might make it extremely dif-

˚
 cult to identify many low-frequency words.
The model predicts that the word superior-
ity 
effect should be greater for high-frequency 
words than for low-frequency ones. The reason  

is that high-frequency words have a higher 

resting level of activation and so should generate 

more top-down activation fro"

The model was not designed to provide a 
comprehensive account of word recognition. 
Accordingly, it is not surprising that it has little 

to say about various factors that play an impor-

tant role in word recognition. For example, we 

have seen that phonological processing is often 

involved in word recognition, but this is not 

considered within the model. In addition, the 

model does not address the role of meaning. 

As we will see, the meaning of relevant context 

often in˜ uences the early stages of word recogni-

tion (e.g., Lucas, 1999; Penolazzi, Hauk, & 

Pulvermüller, 2007).
Context effects
Is word identi˚
 cation in˜
 uenced by context? 
This issue was addressed by Meyer and Schvan-

eveldt (1971) in a study in which participants 

decided whether letter strings formed words 

(lexical decision task). The decision time for a word 

(e.g., DOCTOR) was shorter when the preceding

NURSE) than when it was 
semantically unrelated 

(e.g., LIBRARY) or there was no prime. This is 

known as the 
semantic priming effect
.
Why
 does the semantic priming effect occur? 
Perhaps the context or priming word auto-

matically activates the stored representations 

of all words related to it due to massive previous 

learning. Another possibility is that controlled 

processes may be involved, with a prime such 

as NURSE leading participants to 
expect
 that 

a semantically related word will follow.
Neely (1977) distinguished between the 
above explanations. The priming word was a 

category name (e.g., ﬁBirdﬂ), followed by a 

letter string at one of three intervals: 250, 400, 

or 700 ms. In the key manipulation, participants 

expected a particular category name would 

usually be followed by a member of a 
different
 
pre-speci˚
 ed category (e.g., ﬁBirdﬂ followed 
by the name of part of a building). There were 

two kinds of trial with this manipulation:
The category name was followed by a mem-
(1) 
ber of a different (but expected) category 

(e.g., BirdŒWindow).
The category name was followed by a mem-
(2) 
ber of the same (but unexpected) category
 
(e.g., BirdŒMagpie).
There were two priming or context effects 
(see Figure 9.2). First, there was a rapid, auto-

matic effect based only on semantic relatedness.
 
Second, there was a slower
-acting attentional 
effect based only on expectations. Subsequent 

research has generally con˚ rmed Neely™s (1977) 

˚
 ndings except that automatic processes can 
cause inhibitory effects at short intervals (e.g., 

Antos, 1979).

Do context effects occur 
before
 or 
after
 
the individual has gained access to the internal 
lexicon
 (a
 
store containing several kinds of 
information about words)? In other words, do 

context effects precede or follow 
lexical access
)? 
Lucas (1999) addressed this issue in a meta-

analysis. In most of the studies, each context 

sentence contained an ambiguous word (e.g., ﬁThe 

man spent the entire day ˚ shing on the 
bank
ﬂ). 

The ambiguous word was immediately followed 

by a target word on which a naming or lexical 

decision task was performed. The target word 

was appropriate (e.g., ﬁriverﬂ) or inappropriate 

(e.g., ﬁmoneyﬂ) to the meaning of the ambiguous 

word in the sentence context. Overall, the appro-

priate interpretation of a word produced more 

priming than the inappropriate one.
Further support for the notion that con-
text can in˜ uence lexical access was reported 

b y  Penolazzi et al. (2007) using event-related  

potentials 
(ERPs). The target word (shown here  
in bold) 
was expected (when ﬁaroundﬂ was in the 

s e n tence) or not expected (when ﬁnearﬂ was in the  

sentence): ﬁHe was just around/near the 
corner
.ﬂ 
There was a difference in the ERPs within 200 ms  

of the onset of the target word depending on 

whether the word was expected or unexpected. 

The ˚nding that the meaning of the context 

affected the processing of the target word so 

rapidly suggests (but does not prove) that con-

text affects lexical access to the target word.
We have seen that co"

having a dominant and a non-dominant mean-

ing (e.g., ﬁ˜ owerﬂ is dominant and ﬁ˜
 ourﬂ is 
non-dominant). Participants listened to sentences 

in some of which the context biased the inter-

pretation towards the non-dominant meaning 

of the homophones. Here is an example:
The baker had agreed to make several 

pies for a large event today
, so he started 
by taking out necessary ingredients like 

milk, eggs, and ß
 our
.
At the onset of the homophone at the end 

of the sentence, participants were presented 

with four pictures. In the example given, one 

of the pictures showed ˜ our and another
 
picture showed an object resembling a ˜
 ower. 
The participants showed a tendency to ˚
 xate 
the ˜
 ower-like picture even though the context 
made it very clear that was 
not
 the homo-

phone™s intended meaning.
In sum, context often has a rapid in˜
 uence 
on word processing. However, this in˜
 uence is 
less than total. For example, word meanings 

that are inappropriate in a given context can 

be activated when listening to speech or reading

9 READING AND SPEECH PERCEPTION 
341
The above description of the reading of 
individual words is oversimpli˚ ed. Studies on 
brain-damaged patients suggest that there are 

different reading disorders depending on which 

parts of the language system are damaged. We 

turn now to two major theoretical approaches 

that have considered reading aloud in healthy 

and brain-damaged individuals. These are the 

dual-route cascaded model (Coltheart et al., 

2001) and the distributed connectionist approach  

or triangle model (Plaut, McClelland, Seidenberg, 

& Patterson, 1996).
At the risk of oversimpli˚ cation, we can 
identify various key differences between the two 

approaches as follows. According to the dual-route 

approach, the processes involved in reading 

words and nonwords differ from each other. 
These processes are relatively neat and tidy, and 

some of them are rule-based. According to the 

connectionist approach, in contrast, the various 

processes involved in reading are used more 

ß exibly
 than assumed within the dual-route 

model. In crude terms, it is a matter of ﬁall 

hands to the pumpﬂ: all the relevant knowledge 

we possess about word sounds, word spellings, 

and word meanings is used in parallel whether 

we are reading words or nonwords.
Dual-route cascaded model
Coltheart and his colleagues have put for-

ward various theories of reading, culminating 

in their dual-route cascaded model (2001; see

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
aloud and for silent reading. There are two 
main routes between the printed word and 

speech, 
both starting with orthographic analysis 
(used for identifying and grouping letters 

in printed words). The crucial distinction is 

between a lexical or dictionary lookup route 

and a non-lexical route (Route 1), which involves 

converting letters into sounds. In Figure 9.3, 

the non-lexical route is Route 1, and the lexical  

route is divided into two sub-routes (Routes 2 

and 3).
It is assumed that healthy individuals use 
both routes when reading aloud, and that 

these two routes are not independent in their 

functioning. However, naming visually presented  

words typically depends mostly on the lexical 

route rather than the non-lexical 
route, because 

the former route generally operates  
faster.
It is a 
cascade model
 because activation at 
one level is passed on to the next level before 

processing at the ˚ rst level is complete. Cascaded 

models can be contrasted with thresholded 

models in which activation at one level is only 

passed on to other levels after a given threshold 

of activation is reached.
Earlier we discussed theoretical approaches 
differing in the importance they attach to phono-

logical processing in visual word identi˚
 cation. 
Coltheart et al. (2001) argued for a weak phono-

logical model in which word identi˚
 cation 
generally does not depend on phonological 

processing.
Route 1 (graphemeÐphoneme

language and a phoneme is a basic unit of spoken 

language. According to Coltheart et al. (2001, 

p.212), ﬁBy the term ‚grapheme™ 
we mean a

letter or letter sequence that

assigned to it was the phoneme most com-

monly associated 
with that grapheme in the 
set of English monosyllables that contain that 

graphemeﬂ (p. 
216).
If a brain-damaged patient used only Route 
1, what would we ˚
 nd? The use of graphemeŒ
phoneme conversion rules should permit 

accurate pronunciation of words having regular 

spellingŒsound correspondences but not of 

irregular words not conforming to the con-

version rules. For example, if an irregular 

word such as ﬁpintﬂ has graphemeŒphoneme 

conversion rules applied to it, it should be 

pronounced to rhyme with ﬁhintﬂ. This is known 

as regu
larisation. Finally, graphemeŒphoneme 

c o n version rules can provide pronunciations 

of nonwords.
Patients adhering most closely to exclusive 
use of Route 1 are surface dyslexics. 
Surface 

dyslexia
 is a condition involving particular 

problems in reading irregular words. McCarthy 

and Warrington (1984) studied KT, who had 

surface dyslexia. He read 100% of nonwords 

accurately, and 81% of regular words, but was 

successful with only 41% of irregular words. 

Over 70% of the errors KT made with irregular 

words were due to regularisation.
If patients with surface dyslexia exclusively 
use Route 1, their reading performance should 

not depend on lexical variables (e.g., word 

frequency). That is not true of some surface 

dyslexics. Bub, Cancelliere, and Kertesz (1985) 

studied MP, who read 85% of irregular high-

frequency words accurately but only 40% of 

low-frequency ones. Her ability to read many

9 READING AND SPEECH PERCEPTION 
343
when reading irregular words is that they rely 
primarily on Route 1. If they can also make 

reasonable use of Route 3, then they might be 

able to read aloud correctly nearly all the words 

they know in the absence of any knowledge 

of the meanings of those words stored in the 

semantic system. Thus, there should not be an 

association between impaired semantic know-

ledge and the incidence of surface dyslexia. 

Woollams, Lambon Ralph, Plaut, & Patterson 

(2007) studied patients with semantic dementia 

(see Glossary). This is a condition in which 

brain damage impairs semantic knowledge (see 

Chapter 7), but typically has little effect on the 

orthographic or phonological systems. There was 

a strong association between impaired semantic 

knowledge and surface dyslexia among these 

patients. The implication is that damage to 

the semantic system is often a major factor in 

surface dyslexia.
Route 2 (lexicon + semantic 
knowledge) and Route 3 (lexicon only)
The basic idea behind Route 2 is that repre-
sentations of thousands of familiar words are 

stored in an orthographic input lexicon. Visual 

presentation of a word leads to activation in 

the orthographic input lexicon. This is followed 

by obtaining its meaning from the semantic 

system, after which its sound pattern is gener-

ated by the phonological output lexicon. Route 
"
Segment_603,"3 also involves the orthographic input and   phonological output lexicons, but it bypasses   the semantic system. How could we identify patients using  Route 2 or Route 3 but not Route 1?

3 also involves the orthographic input and 

phonological output lexicons, but it bypasses 

the semantic system.
How could we identify patients using 
Route 2 or Route 3 but not Route 1? Their 

intact orthographic input lexicon means they 

can pronounce familiar words whether regular 

or irregular. However, their inability to use 

graphemeŒphoneme conversion should mean 

they ˚ nd it very hard to pronounce unfamiliar 

words and nonwords.
Phonological dyslexics ˚ t this predicted 
pattern fairly well. 
Phonological dyslexia
 involves 

particular problems with reading unfamiliar 

words and nonwords. The ˚ rst case of phono-

logical dyslexia reported systematically was RG 

(Beauvois & Dérouesné, 1979). RG successfully 
read 100% of real words but only 10% of 

nonwords. Funnell (1983) studied a patient, 

WB. His ability to use Route 1 was very limited 

because he could not produce the sound of any 

single letters or nonwords. He could read 85% 

of words, and seemed to do this by using Route 

2. He had a poor ability to make semantic 

judgements about words, suggesting he was 

bypassing the semantic system when reading 

words.
According to the dual-route model, phono-
logical dyslexics have 
speciÞ c
 problems with 

graphemeŒphoneme conversion. However, 

Coltheart (1996) discussed 18 patients with 

phonological dyslexia, all of whom had 
general
 
phonological impairments. Subsequent research 

has indicated that some phonological dyslexics 

have impairments as speci˚ c as assumed within 

the dual-route model. Caccappolo-van Vliet, 

Miozzo, and Stern (2004) studied two phono-

logical dyslexics. IB was a 77-year-old woman 

who had worked as a secretary, and MO was 

a 48-year-old male accountant. Both patients 

showed the typical pattern associated with 

phonological dyslexia Œ their performance on 

reading regular and irregular words exceeded 

90% compared to under 60% with nonwords. 

Crucially, the performance of IB and MO on 

various "

inability to read nonwords. However, the most 
striking symptom is semantic reading errors 

(e.g., ﬁshipﬂ read as ﬁboatﬂ). Deep dyslexia may 

result from damage to the graphemeŒphoneme 

conversion and semantic systems. Deep dyslexia 

resembles a more severe form of phonological 

dyslexia. Indeed, deep dyslexics showing some 

recovery of reading skills often become phono-

logical dyslexics (Southwood & 
Chatterjee, 
2001). 
Sato, Patterson, Fushimi, Maxim, and Bryan 

(2008) studied a Japanese 
woman, YT. She had 

problems with the 
Japanese script
 kana
 (each 
symbol represents a syllable) and the Japanese 

script 
kanji
 (each symbol stands for a morpheme, 
which is the smallest unit of meaning). YT showed 

deep dyslexia for kanji but phonological dyslexia 

for kana. Sato et 
al. concluded that YT™s impaired  
reading 
performance was due mainly to a general  
phono 
logical de˚
 cit.
The notion that deep dyslexia and phono-
logical dyslexia involves similar underlying mech-

anisms is an attractive one. Jefferies, Sage, and 

Lambon Ralph (2007) found that deep dyslexics 

performed poorly on various phonologically-

based tasks (e.g., phoneme addition; phoneme 

subtraction). They c"

have a general phonological impairment, as do 

phonological dyslexics.
Computational modelling
Coltheart et al. (2001) produced a detailed 

computational model to test their dual-route 

cascaded model. They started with 7981 one-

syllable words varying in length between one 

and eight letters. They used McClelland and 

Rumelhart™s (1981) interactive activation model 

(discussed earlier) as the basis for the ortho-

graphic component of their model, and the 

output or response side of the model derives 

from the theories of Dell (1986) and Levelt et al.  

(1999) (see Chapter 11). The pronunciation most 

activated by processing in the lexical and non-

lexical routes is the one determining the naming 

response.
Evidence
Coltheart et al. (2001) presented their com-

putational model with all 7981 words and found 
that 7898 (99%) were read accurately. When the 

model was presented with 7000 one-syllable 

nonwords, it read 98.9% of them correctly.
It follows from the model that we might 
expect different brain regions to be associated 

with each route. What has been done in several 

studies is to compare the brain activation when 

participants name irregular words and pseudo-

words (pronounceable nonwords). The assump-

tion is that the lexical route is of primary 

importance with irregular words, whereas the 

non-lexical route is used with pseudowords. 

Seghier, Lee, Scho˚ eld, Ellis, and Price (2008) 

found that the left anterior occipito-temporal 

region was associated with reading irregular words. 

In contrast, the left 
posterior occipito-temporal  

region was associated 
with reading pseudowords. 
These ˚
 ndings are consistent with the notion 
of separate routes in reading.
Zevin and Balota (2000) argued that the 
extent to which we use the lexical and non-

lexical routes when naming words depends on 

attentional control. Readers named low-frequency 

irregular words or pseudowords before naming 

a target "
Segment_606,"word. They predicted that naming   irregular words would cause readers to attend   to lexical information, whereas naming pseudo-  words would lead them to attend to non-lexical   information. As predicted, the relative roles of   the lexical and non-lexical routes in reading   the target word were",Explores how memory influences cognition.,"attention, memory, awareness",Nested under Chapter on emotion,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in memory,Aligned with contemporary studies on perception,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_1392,"word. They predicted that naming 

irregular words would cause readers to attend 

to lexical information, whereas naming pseudo-

words would lead them to attend to non-lexical 

information. As predicted, the relative roles of 

the lexical and non-lexical routes in reading 

the target word were affected by what had 

been read previously.
According to the model,
 
regular words 
(those 
conforming to the graphemeŒphoneme 
rules in Route 1) can often be named faster than 

irregular words. According to the distributed 

connectionist approach (Plaut et al., 1996; 

discussed shortly), what is important is con-

sistency. Consistent words have letter patterns 

that are always pronounced the same in all 

words in which they appear and are assumed 

to be faster to name than inconsistent words. 

Irregular words tend to be inconsistent, and 

so we need to decide whether 
regularity
 or 

consistency
 is more important. Jared (2002) 

compared directly the effects of regularity and 

of consistency on word naming. Her ˚
 ndings 
were reasonably clear-cut: word naming times

were affected much more by consistency than 
by regularity (see Figure 9.4). This ˚
 nding, which 
is contrary to the dual-route model, has 
been  

replicated in other studies (Harley, 2008).
Evaluation
The dual-route cascaded model represents an 

ambitious attempt to account for basic reading 

processes in brain-damaged and healthy indi-

viduals. Its explanation of reading disorders such 

as surface dyslexia and phonological dyslexia 

has been very in˜ uential. The model has also 

proved useful in accounting for the naming and 

lexical-decision performance of healthy indi-

viduals, and has received some support from 

studies in cognitive neuroscience (e.g., Seghier 

et al., 2008). Perry, Ziegler, and Zorzi (2007) 

developed a new connect"
Segment_607,"ionist dual process model   (the CDP +  model) based in part on the dual-route  cascaded model. This new model includes a   lexical and a sublexical route, and eliminates some    of the problems with the dual-route cascaded   model (e.g., its inability to learn; its inability   to account for consis",Explores how attention influences cognition.,"memory, emotion, awareness",Nested under Chapter on attention,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in memory,Aligned with contemporary studies on attention,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_1240,"ionist dual process model 

(the CDP

 model) based in part on the dual-route 
cascaded model. This new model includes a 

lexical and a sublexical route, and eliminates some  

of the problems with the dual-route cascaded 

model (e.g., its inability to learn; its inability 

to account for consistency effects).
What are the model™s limitations? First, the 
assumption that the time taken to pronounce 

a word depends on its regularity rather than 

its consistency is incorrect (e.g., Glushko, 1979; 

Jared, 2002). This is serious because the theor-

etical signi˚ cance of word regularity follows 

directly from the central assumption that the 

non-lexical route uses a graphemeŒphoneme 

rule system.
Second, as Perry et al. (2007, p. 276) 
pointed out, ﬁA major shortcoming of DRC 

[dual-route cascaded model] is the absence 

of learning. DRC is fully hardwired, and the 

nonlexical route operates with a partially hard-

coded set of grapheme Œphoneme rules.ﬂ
Third, the model assumes that only the 
non-lexical route is involved in pronouncing 

nonwords. As a consequence, similarities and 

differences between nonwords and genuine 

words are irrelevant. In fact, however, we will 

see shortly that prediction is incorrect, because 

consistent nonwords are faster to pronounce 

than inconsistent ones (Zevin & Seidenberg, 

2006).
Fourth, the model assumes that the phono-
logical processing of visually presented words 

occurs fairly slowly and has relatively little effect 

on visual word recognition. In fact, however, such 

phonological processes generally occur rapidly 

and automatically (Rastle & Brysbaert, 2006).
Fifth, it is assumed that the semantic system 
can play an important role in reading aloud 

(i.e., via Route 2). In practice, however, ﬁThe 

semantic system of the model remains unimple-

mentedﬂ (Woollams et al., 2007, p. 317). The

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
Distributed connectionist 
approach
Within the dual-route model, it is assumed that 
pronouncing irregular words and nonwords 

involves different routes. This contrasts with the 

connectionist approach pioneered by Seidenberg 

and McClelland (1989) and developed most 

notably by Plaut et al. (1996). According to 

Plaut et al. (p. 58), their approach
eschews [avoids] separate mechanisms 

for pronouncing nonwords and exception 

[irregular] words. Rather, all of the 
systemÕ
s knowledge of spellingÐsound 
correspondences is brought to bear in 

pronouncing all types of letter strings

and competitive interactions based on 

how the letter string relates to all known 

words and their pronunciations.
Thus, Plaut et al. (1996) assumed that the pro-

nunciation of words and nonwords is based on  
a highly 
interactive
 system.
This general approach is known as the dis-
tributed connectionist approach or the triangle 

model (see Figure 9.5). The three sides of the 

triangle are orthography (spelling), phonology 

(sound), and semantics (meaning). There are 

two routes from spelling to sound: (1) a direct 

pathway from orthography to phonology; and 

(2) an indirect pathway from orthography to 

phonology that proceeds via word meanings.
Plaut et al. (1996) argued that words (and 
nonwords) vary in consistency (the extent to 

which their pronunciation agrees with those 

of similarly spelled words). Highly consistent 

words and nonwords can generally be pro-

nounced faster and more accurately than incon-

sistent words and nonwords, because more of 

the available knowledge supports the correct 

pronunciation of such words. In contrast, the 

dual-route cascaded model divides words into 

two categories: words are regular (conforming 

to grapheme Œphoneme rules) or irregular (not 
conforming to those rules). As we have seen, 

the evidence favours the notion of consistency 

over regularity (Jared, 2002).
Plaut et al. (1996) developed a successful 
simulation of reading performance. Their net-

work learned to pronounce words accurately 

as connections developed between the visual 

forms of letters and combinations of letters 

(grapheme units) and their corresponding pho-

nemes (phoneme units). The network learned 

via back-propagation, in which the actual out-

puts or responses of the system are compared 

against the correct ones (see Chapter 1). The 

network received prolonged training with 2998 

words. At the end of training, the network™s 

performance resembled that of adult readers

347
The network pronounced over 90% of 
(4) 
nonwords ﬁcorrectlyﬂ, which is comparable 
to adult readers. This is impressive given 

that the network received no direct training 

on nonwords.
What role does semantic knowledge of 
words play in Plaut et al.™s (1996) model? It is 

assumed that the route from orthography to 

phonology via meaning is typically slower than
 
the direct route proceeding straight from ortho-

graphy to phonology. Semantic knowledge is 

most likely to have an impact for inconsistent 

words Œ they take longer to name, and this 

provides more opportunity for semantic know-

ledge to have an effect.
Evidence
How does the distributed connectionist approach 

account for surface dyslexia, phonological 

dyslexia, and deep dyslexia? It is assumed that 

surface dyslexia (involving problems in reading 

irregular or inconsistent words) occurs mainly 

because of damage to the semantic system. We 

saw earlier that patients with semantic dementia 

(which involves extensive damage to the semantic 

system) generally exhibit the symptoms of sur-

face dyslexia. Plaut et al. (1996) damaged their 

model to reduce or eliminate the contribution 

from semantics. The network™s reading per-

formance remained very good on regular 

high- and low-frequency words and on non-

words,"
Segment_611,"worse on irregular high-frequency words,   and worst on irregular low-frequency words.   This matches the pattern found with surface   dyslexics.

and worst on irregular low-frequency words. 

This matches the pattern found with surface 

dyslexics.
It is assumed that phonological dyslexia 
(involving problems in reading unfamiliar 
words 

and nonwords) is due to a general impair
ment 

of phonological processing. The evidence is 

mixed (see earlier discussion). On the one 

hand, Coltheart (1996) found many cases in 

which phonological dyslexia was associated 

with a general phonological impairment. On 

the other hand, Caccappolo-van Vliet et al. 

(2004) studied phonological dyslexics whose 

phonological processing was almost intact. 

Phonological dyslexics may also suffer from 
an orthographic impairment in addition to the 

phonological one. Howard and Best (1996) 

found that their patient, Melanie-Jane, was 

better at reading pseudohomophones whose 

spelling resembled the related word (e.g., 

ﬁgerlﬂ) than those whose spellings did not (e.g., 

ﬁphocksﬂ). Finally, Nickels, Biedermann, Coltheart, 

Saunders, and Tree (2008) used a combination 

of computer modelling and data from phono-

logical dyslexics. No 
single
 locus of impairment 
(e.g., the phonological system) could account for 

the various impairments found in patients.
What does the model say about deep 
dyslexia? Earlier we discussed evidence (e.g., 

Jefferies et al., 2007) suggesting that a general 

phonological impairment is of major impor-

tance in deep dyslexia. Support for this view-

point was provided by Crisp and Lambon 

Ralph (2006). They studied patients with deep 

dyslexia or phonological dyslexia. There was 

no clear dividing line between the two con-

ditions, with the two groups sharing many 

symptoms. Patients with both conditions had 

a severe phonological impairment, but patients 

with deep dyslexia were more likely than those 

with phonological dyslexia to have severe 

semantic impairments as well.

McKay, Davis, Savage, and Castles (2008) decided 

to test this prediction directly by training parti-

cipants to read aloud nonwords (e.g., ﬁbinkﬂ). 

Some of the nonwords had consistent (or expected) 

pronunciations whereas others had inconsistent 

pronunciations. The crucial manipulation was 

that participants learned the meanings of some 

of these nonwords but not of others.
The ˚ ndings obtained by McKay et al. (2008) 
were entirely in line with the model. Reading 

aloud was faster for nonwords in the semantic 

condition (learning pronunciations) than in the 

non-semantic condition when the nonwords 

were inconsistent (see Figure 9.6). However, 

speed of reading aloud was the same in the 

semantic and non-semantic conditions when 

the nonwords were consistent.

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
According to the triangle model, the time 
taken to pronounce nonwords should depend 
on whether they are consistent or not. For 

example, the word body ﬁŒustﬂ is very con-

sistent because it is always pronounced in the 

same way in monosyllabic words, and so the 

nonword ﬁnustﬂ is consistent. In contrast, 

the word body ﬁŒaveﬂ is inconsistent because 

it is pronounced in different ways in different 

words (e.g., ﬁsaveﬂ and ﬁhaveﬂ), and so the 

nonword ﬁmaveﬂ is inconsistent. The prediction  

is that inconsistent nonwords will take longer 

to pronounce. According to the dual-route 

cascaded model, in contrast, nonwords are pro-

nounced using non-lexical pronunciation rules 

and so there should be no difference between 

consistent and inconsistent nonwords.
The ˚ ndings are clear-cut. Inconsistent non-
words take longer to pronounce than consistent 

ones (Glushko, 1979; Zevin & Seidenberg, 

2006). Such "
Segment_613,"˚ ndings provide support for the   triangle model over the dual-route model.   Zevin and Seidenberg obtained further support   for the triangle model over the dual-route   model.

triangle model over the dual-route model. 

Zevin and Seidenberg obtained further support 

for the triangle model over the dual-route 

model. According to the dual-route model, the 

pronunciation rules should generate only 
one
 

pronunciation for each nonword. According 
to the triangle model, however, the pronunci-

ations of inconsistent nonwords should be more  

variable than those of consistent ones, and that 

is what was found.
Evaluation
The distributed connectionist approach has 

several successes to its credit. First, the over-

arching assumption that the orthographic, 

semantic, and phonological systems are used in  

parallel in an interactive fashion during reading 

has received much support. Second, much 
pro-
gress has been made in understanding reading 

disorders by assuming that a general phono-

logical impairment underlies phonological dys-

lexia, whereas a semantic impairment underlies  

surface dyslexia. Third, the assumption that the 

semantic system is often important in reading 

aloud appears correct (e.g., McKay et al., 2008). 

Fourth, the assumption that consistency is more 

important than word regularity (emphasised 

within the dual-route cascaded model) in deter-

mining the time taken to name words has 

received strong support. Fifth, the distributed 

connectionist approach is more successful than 

the dual-route model in accounting for con-

sistency effects with nonwords and for individual 

differences in nonword naming (Zevin & 

Seidenberg, 2006). Sixth, the distributed con-

nectionist approach includes an explicit mech-

anism to simulate how we learn to pronounce 

words, whereas the dual-route model has less 

to say about learning.
What are the triangle model™s limitations? 
First, as Harley (2008) pointed out, connectionist 

models have tended to focus on the processes 

involved in reading relatively simple, single-

syllable words.

somewhat 
oversimpli˚
 ed. Phonological dyslexia  
is supposed 
to be due to a general phonological 
impairment, but 
some phonological dyslexics 
do not show that general impairment (e.g., 
Caccappolo-van Vliet et al., 2004; Tree & Kay, 

2006). In similar fashion, surface dyslexia is 

supposed to be due to a general semantic impair-

ment, 
but this is not always the case (Woollams 
et al., 
2007).
Fourth, we saw earlier that the processes 
involved in naming words can be in˜
 uenced 
by attentional control (Zevin & Balota, 2000). 

However, this is not a factor explicitly con-

sidered within the triangle model.
READING: EYE-MOVEMENT 
RESEARCH
Eye movements are of fundamental importance 
to reading. Most of the information that we 

process from a text at any given moment relates  

to the word that is currently being ˚
 xated, 
although some information may be processed 

from other words close to the ˚
 xation point.
Our eyes seem to move smoothly across 
the page while reading. In fact, they actually 

move in rapid jerks (
saccades
), as you c"

if you look closely at someone else reading. 

Saccades are ballistic (once initiated, their 

direction cannot be changed). There are fairly 

frequent regressions in which the eyes move 

backwards in the text, accounting for about 

10% of all saccades. Saccades take 20 Œ30 ms 

to complete, and are separated by ˚
 xations 
lasting for 200 Œ250 ms. The length of each 

saccade is approximately eight letters or spaces. 

Information is extracted from the text only 

during each ˚ xation and not during the inter-

vening saccades (Latour, 1962).
The amount of text from which useful 
information can be obtained in each ˚
 xation 
has been studied using the ﬁmoving windowﬂ 

technique (see Rayner & Sereno, 1994). Most of  

the text is mutilated except for an experimenter-

de˚
 ned area or window surrounding the reader™s 
˚
 xation point. Every time the reader moves 
his/her eyes, different parts of the text are 
mutilated to permit normal reading only within 

the window region. The effects of different-

sized windows on reading performance can be 

compared.
The 
perceptual span
 (effective ˚ eld of view) 
is affected by the dif˚ culty of the text and print 

size. It extends three or four letters to the left 

of ˚ xation and up to 15 letters to the right. 

This asymmetry is clearly learned. Readers of 

Hebrew, which is read from right to left, show 

the opposite asymmetry (Pollatsek, Bolozky, 

Well,  &  
Rayner, 1981). The size of the perceptual 

span means that parafoveal information (from 

the area surrounding the central or foveal 

region of high visual acuity) is used in reading. 

Convincing evidence comes from use of the 

boundary technique, in which there is a preview  

word just to the right of the point of ˚
 xation. 
As the reader makes a saccade to this word, 

it changes into the target word, although the 

reader is unaware of the change. The ˚
 xation 
duration on the target word is less when that 

word is the same as the previe"

(see Reichle, Pollatsek, Fisher, & Rayner, 1998)

Readers typically ˚ xate about 80% of content 
words (nouns, verbs, and adjectives), whereas 

they ˚ xate only about 20% of function words 

(articles such as ﬁaﬂ and ﬁtheﬂ; conjunctions 

such as ﬁandﬂ, ﬁbutﬂ, and ﬁorﬂ); and pronouns 

such as ﬁheﬂ, ﬁsheﬂ, and ﬁtheyﬂ). Words not 

˚
 xated tend to be common, short, or predictable. 
Thus, words easy to process are most likely to 

be skipped. Finally, there is the 
spillover effect
: 
saccades:
 fast eye movements that cannot be 
altered after being initiated.

perceptual span:
 the effective Þ eld of view in 

reading (letters to the left and right of Þ xation 

that can be processed).

spillover effect:
 any given word is Þ xated 

longer during reading when preceded by a rare 

word rather than a common one.

the ˚ xation time on a word is longer when it 
is preceded by a rare word.
E-Z Reader model
Reichle et al. (1998), Reichle, Rayner, and 

Pollatsek (2003), and Pollatsek, Reichle, and 

Rayner (2006) have 
accounted for the pattern 

of eye movements 
in reading in various versions 

of their E-Z Reader model. The name is a spoof 

on the title of the movie 
Easy Rider
. However, 

this is only clear if you know that Z is pro-

nounced ﬁzeeﬂ in American English!
How do we use our eyes when reading? The 
most obvious model assumes that we ˚
 xate on 
a word until we have processed it adequately, 

after which we immediately ˚ xate the next 

word until it has been adequately processed. 

Alas, there are two major problems with such 

a model. First, it takes 85Œ200 ms to execute an  

eye-movement programme. If readers operated 

according to the simple m"
Segment_617,"odel described above,   they would waste time waiting for their eyes   to move to the next word. Second, as we have   seen, readers sometimes skip words.

they would waste time waiting for their eyes 

to move to the next word. Second, as we have 

seen, readers sometimes skip words. It is hard 

to see how this could happen within the model, 

because readers would not know anything about 

the next word until they had ˚ xated it. How, 
then, could they decide which words to skip?
The E-Z Reader model provides an ele-
gant solution to the above problems. A crucial 

assumption is that the next eye movement is 

programmed after only
 part
 of the processing 

of the currently ˚ xated word has occurred. This 

assumption greatly reduces the time between 

completion of processing on the current word 

and movement of the eyes to the next word. 

There is typically less spare time available 

with rare words than common ones, and that 

accounts for the spillover effect described above.  

If the processing of the next word is completed 

rapidly enough (e.g., it is highly predictable in 

the sentence context), it is skipped.
According to the model, readers can attend 
to two words (the currently ˚
 xated one and the 
next word) during a single ˚
 xation. However, 
it is a 
serial
 processing model, meaning that at 

any given moment only 
one
 word is processed. 

This can be contrasted with 
parallel
 processing 

models such as the SWIFT (Saccade-generation 

With Inhibition by Foveal Targets) model put 

forward by Engbert, Longtin, and Kliegl (2002) 

and Engbert, Nuthmann, Richter, and Kliegl 

(2005). It is assumed within the SWIFT model 

that the durations of eye ˚ xations in reading 

are in˜ uenced by the previous and the next 

word as well as the one currently ˚
 xated. As 
Kliegl (2007) pointed out, the typical perceptual 

span of about 18 letters is large enough to 

accommodate all three words (prior, current, 

and next) provided they are of average length. 

We will discuss evidence comparing serial and 

parallel models later.

stage takes longer than the ˚
 rst one.
Completion of the second stage is the 
(4) 
signal for a shift of covert (internal) atten-
tion to the next word.

Frequency checking and lexical access are 
(5) 
completed faster for common words than 

rare ones (more so for lexical access).

Frequency checking and lexical access are 
(6) 
completed faster for predictable than for 

unpredictable words.
The above theoretical assumptions lead to 
various predictions (see Figure 9.7). Assumptions 

(2) and (5) together predict that the time spent 

˚
 xating common words will be less than rare 
words: this has been found repeatedly
. According 
to the model, readers spend the time between 

completion of lexical access to one word and 

the next eye movement in parafoveal processing 

of the next word. There is less parafoveal 

processing when the ˚ xated word is rare (see 

Figure 9.7). Thus, the word following a rare 

word needs to be ˚ xated longer than the word 

following a common word (the spillover effect 

described earlier).
Why
 are common, predictable, or short 
words most likely to be skipped or not ˚
 xated? 
A word is skipped when its lexical access has 

been completed while the current word is being 

˚
 xated. "
Segment_619,"This is most likely to happen with  common, predictable, or short words because   lexical access is fastest for these words (assump-  tions 5 and 6). Evidence Reichle et al.

Evidence
Reichle et al. (2003) compared 11 models of 

reading in terms of whether each one could 

account for each of eight phenomena (e.g., 

frequency effects; spillover effects; costs of 

skipping). E-Z Reader accounted for all eight 

phenomena, whereas eight of the other models 

accounted for no more than two.
One of the model™s main assumptions is that 
information about word frequency is accessed 

rapidly during word processing. There is support 

for that assumption. For example, Sereno, 

Rayner, and Posner (1998) observed effects 

of word frequency on event-related potentials 

(ERPs; see Glossary) within 150 ms.
The model was designed to account for the 
eye ˚ xations of native English speakers reading 

English texts. However, English is unusual in 

some respects (e.g., word order is very impor-

tant), and it is possible that the reading strategies 

used by readers of English are not universal. This 

issue was addressed by Rayner, Li, and Pollatsek 

(2007), who studied eye movements in Chinese 

readers reading Chinese text. Chinese differs 

from English in that it is written without spaces 

between successive characters and consists 

ofwords mostly made up of two characters. 

However, the pattern of eye movements was 

similar to that previously found for readers of 

English.

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
Shillcock (2003) found that common words 
were more predictable than rare ones on the 

basis of the preceding word. When the effects of  

word frequency and word predictability were 

disentangled, the effects of word frequency on 

word ˚ xation time disappeared.
It is assumed within the model that ˚
 xations 
should be shortest when they are on the centre 

of words rather than towards either end. The 

reason is because word identi˚
 cation should 
be easiest when that happens. In fact, ˚
 xations 
tend to be much 
longer
 when they are at the 

centre of words than towards one end (Vitu, 

McConkie, Kerr, & O™Regan, 2001). Why is 

this? Some ˚ xations at the end of a word are 

short because readers decide to make a second 

˚
 xation closer to the middle of the word to 
facilitate its identi˚
 cation.
We turn ˚ nally to the controversial assump-
tion that words are processed serially (one at a  

time), which is opposed by advocates of parallel 

processing models such as SWIFT (Engbert 

et al., 2002, 2005). We will focus on 
parafoveal-

on-foveal effects
 Œ it sounds complicated but 

simply means that characteristics of the 
next
 

word in˜ uence the ˚ xation duration on the 

current
 word. If such effects exist, they suggest 

that the current and the next word are both 

processed at the same time. In other words, 

these effects suggest the existence of parallel 

processing, which is predicted by the SWIFT 

model but not by the E-Z Reader model.
The ˚ ndings are mixed (see Rayner et al. 
(2007) for a review). However, Kennedy, Pynte, 

and Ducrot (2002) obtained convincing evidence  

of parafoveal-on-foveal effects in a methodo-

logically sound study. White (2008) varied the 

orthographic familiarity and word frequency 

of the next word. There were no parafoveal-on-

foveal effects when wor"
Segment_621,"d frequency was manipu-  lated and only a very small effect (6 ms) when   orthographic familiarity was manipulated. These    ˚  ndings suggest there may be a limited amount  of parallel processing involving low-level features    (i.e., letters) of the next word, but not lexical   features (i.e., wor",Explores how awareness influences cognition.,"memory, recognition, emotion",Nested under Chapter on emotion,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in perception,Aligned with contemporary studies on recognition,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_378,"d frequency was manipu-

lated and only a very small effect (6 ms) when 

orthographic familiarity was manipulated. These  

˚
 ndings suggest there may be a limited amount 
of parallel processing involving low-level features  

(i.e., letters) of the next word, but not lexical 

features (i.e., word frequency).
According to the E-Z Reader model, readers 
˚
 xate and process words in the ﬁcorrectﬂ order 
(although occasional words may be skipped). 

If readers deviate from the ﬁcorrectﬂ order, it 

would be expected that they would struggle 

to make sense of what they are reading. In 

contrast, a parallel processing model such as 

SWIFT does not assume that words have to be 

read in the correct order or that deviation from 

that order necessarily creates any problems. 

Kennedy and Pynte (2008) found that readers 

only rarely read texts in a totally orderly fashion. 

In addition, there was practically no evidence 

that a failure to read the words in a text in the 

correct order caused any signi˚
 cant disruption 
to processing.
Evaluation
The model has proved very successful. It speci˚
 es 
many of the major factors determining eye 

movements in reading, and has performed 

well against rival models. At a very general 

level, the model has identi˚ ed close connections 

between eye ˚ xations and cognitive processes 

during reading. In addition, the model has 

identi˚
 ed various factors (e.g., word frequency; 
word predictability) in˜
 uencing ˚
 xation times.
What are the limitations of the model? 
First, its emphasis is very much on the early pro-

cesses involved in reading (e.g., lexical access). 

As a result, the model has little to say about 

higher-level processes (e.g., integration of infor-

mation across the words within a sentence) that 

are important in reading. Reichle et al. (2003) 

defended their neglect of higher-level processes 

as follows: ﬁWe posit [assume] that higher-order

a time and that words are processed in the 
ﬁcorrectﬂ order. The existence of parafoveal-on-

foveal effects (e.g., Kennedy et al., 2002; White, 

2008) suggests that parallel processing can 

occur, but the effects are generally small. The 

˚
 nding that most readers fail to process the 
words in a text strictly in the ﬁcorrectﬂ order 

is inconsistent with the model.
Third, the emphasis of the model is perhaps 
too much on explaining eye-movement data 

rather than other ˚ ndings on reading. As Sereno, 

Brewer, and O™Donnell (2003, p. 331) pointed 

out, ﬁThe danger is that in setting out to establish 

a model of eye-movement control, the result 

may be a model of eye-movement experiments.ﬂ  

What is needed is to integrate the ˚
 ndings from 
eye-movement studies more closely with general 

theories of reading.
Fourth, the model attaches great importance 
to word frequency as a determinant of the 
length 
of eye ˚
 xations. However, word frequency 
generally correlates with word predictability, 

and some evidence (e.g., McDonald & Shillcock, 

2003) suggests that word predictability may be  

more important than word frequency.

forward than one might imagine. Some idea of

(e.g., traf˚ c noise). Decoding itself involves extract-
ing discrete elements from the speech signal. 

Cutler and Clifton (1999, p. 126) provide a good 

account of what is involved: ﬁLinguists describe  

speech as a series of phonetic segments; a phonetic 

segment (
phoneme
) is simply the smallest unit 

in terms of which spoken language can be sequen-

tially described. Thus, the word 
key
 consists of  

two segments /ki/, and 
sea
 of the two segments 
/si/; they differ in the ˚
 rst phoneme.ﬂ
It is generally assumed that the second 
stage of speech perception involves identifying 

the syllables contained in the speech signal. 

However, there is some controversy as to whether 

the phoneme or the syllable is the basic unit (or  

building block) in speech perception. Goldinger 

and Azuma (2003) argued that there is no basic  

unit of speech perception. Instead, the perceptual 

unit varies ˜ exibly depending on the precise 

circumstances. They presented listeners with 

lists of two-syllable nonwords and asked them 

to decide whether each nonword contained a 

target."
Segment_624,"The target was a phoneme or a syllable.   The volunteers who recorded the lists of non-  words were told that phonemes are the basic   units of speech perception or that syllables are   the basic units. These instructions in˜  uenced  how they read the nonwords, and this in turn   affected the list",Explores how attention influences cognition.,"attention, awareness, emotion",Nested under Chapter on attention,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in memory,Aligned with contemporary studies on recognition,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_790," The target was a phoneme or a syllable. 

The volunteers who recorded the lists of non-

words were told that phonemes are the basic 

units of speech perception or that syllables are 

the basic units. These instructions in˜
 uenced 
how they read the nonwords, and this in turn 

affected the listeners™ performance. Listeners 

detected phoneme targets faster than syllable 

targets when the speaker believed phonemes 

are the fundamental units in speech perception. 

In contrast, they detected syllable targets faster 

than phoneme targets when the speaker believed 

syllables are the basic perceptual units. Thus, 

either phonemes or syllables can form the 

perceptual units in speech perception.
The third stage of speech perception (word 
identi˚
 cation) is of particular importance. Some 
of the main problems in word identi˚
 cation 
are discussed shortly. However, we will mention 

one problem here. Most people know tens of 

thousands of words, but these words (in English 

at least) are constructed out of only about 35 

phonemes. The obvious consequence is that 

the great majority of spoken words resemble 

many other words at the phonemic level, and 

so are hard for listeners to distinguish.
The fourth and ˚
 fth stages both emphasise 
speech comprehension. The focus in the fourth 

stage is on interpretation of the utterance. 

This involves constructing a coherent meaning 

for each sentence on the basis of informa-

tion about individual words and their order in 

the sentence. Finally, in the ˚ fth stage, the focus 

is on integrating the meaning of the current 

sentence with preceding speech to construct an 

overall model of the speaker™s message.
Speech signal
Useful information about the speech signal has 

been obtained from the 
spectrograph
. Sound 

enters this instrument through a microphone, 

and is then converted into an electrical signal. 

This signal is fed to a bank of ˚
 lters selecting 
narrow-frequency bands. Finally, the spectro"

frequencies of speech over time; this is known

information about 
formants
, which are fre-

quency bands emphasised by the vocal apparatus 

when saying a phoneme. Vowels have three 

formants numbered ˚ rst, second, and third, 

starting with the formant of lowest frequency. 

The sound frequency of vowels is generally 

lower than that of consonants.
Spectrograms may seem to provide an 
accurate picture of those aspects of the sound 

wave having the greatest influence on the 

human auditory system. However, this is not 

necessarily so. For example, formants look 

important in a spectrogram, but this does 

not prove they are of value in human speech 

perception. Evidence that the spectrogram is 

of value has been provided by using a

which is ﬁthe overlapping of adjacent

More specifically, the way a phoneme
 
is produced depends on the phonemes 

preceding and following it. The existence 

of co-articulation means that the pro-

nunciation of any given phoneme is not 

invariant, which can create problems for 

the listener. However, co-articulation means 

that listeners hearing one phoneme are 

provided with some information about 

the surrounding phonemes. For example,

(1993) asked various speakers to say the 

same short words starting with a consonant. 

There were clear differences across speakers  

in their spectrograms. Wong, Nusbaum, 

and Small (2004) studied brain activation 

when listeners were exposed to several 

speakers or to only one. When exposed 

to several speakers at different times, 

listeners had increased attentional pro-

cessing in the major speech areas (e.g., 

posterior superior temporal cortex) and in 

areas associated with attentional shifts (e.g., 

superior parietal cortex). Thus, listeners 

respond to the challenge of hearing several 

different voices by using active attentional  

and other processes.

Mattys and Liss (2008) pointed out that 
(5) 
listeners in everyday life have to contend 

with degraded speech. For example, there 

are often other people talking at the same 

time and/or there are distracting sounds 

(e.g., noise of traf˚ c or aircraft). It is of some
 
concern that listeners in the laboratory 

are rarely confronted by these problems 

in research on speech perception. This led 

Mattys and Liss (p. 1235) to argue that, 

ﬁLaboratory-generated phenomena re˜
 ect 
what the speech perception system 
can
 

do with highly constrained input.ﬂ
We have identi˚ed several problems that 
listeners face when trying to make sense of 

spoken language. Below we consider some of 

the main ways in which listeners cope with 

these problems.
Lip-reading: McGurk effect
Listeners (even those with normal hearing) 

often make extensive use of lip-reading to 

provide them with additional information. 

McGurk and MacDonald (1976) provided 
a striking demonstration. They prepared a 

videotape of someone saying ﬁbaﬂ repeatedly. 

The sound channel then changed so there was 

a voice saying ﬁgaﬂ repeatedly in synchron-

i sation with lip movements still indicating ﬁbaﬂ. 

Listeners reported hearing ﬁdaﬂ, a blending of 

the visual and auditory information. Green"

Kuhl, Meltzoff, and Stevens (1991) showed 

that the so-called McGurk effect is surprisingly 

robust Œ they found it even with a female face 

and a male voice.
It is generally assumed that the McGurk 
effect depends primarily on bottom-up pro-

cesses triggered directly by the discrepant 

visual and auditory signals. If so, the McGurk 

effect should not be in˜ uenced by top-down 

processes based on listeners™ expectations. How-

ever, expectations are important. More listeners 

produced the McGurk effect when the crucial 

word (based on blending the discrepant visual 

and auditory cues) was presented in a semant-

ically congruent than a semant ically incongruent 

sentence (Windmann, 2004). Thus, top-down 

processes play an important role.
Addressing the segmentation 
problem
Listeners have to divide the speech they hear 
into its constituent words (i.e., segmentation) 
Listeners often have to contend with degraded 
speech; for example: interference from a crackly 

phone line; street noise; or other people nearby 

talking at the same time. How do we cope with 

these problems?

and decide what words are being presented. 
There has been controversy as to whether 

segmentation precedes and assists word recog-

nition or whether it is the product of word 

recognition. We will return to that controversy 

shortly. Before doing so, we will consider various 

non-lexical cues used by listeners to facilitate 

segmentation. First, certain sequences of speech 

sounds (e.g., <m,r> in English) are never found 

together within a syllable, and such sequences 

suggest a likely boundary between words (Dumay, 

Frauenfelder, & Content, 2002).
Second, Norris, McQueen, Cutler, and 
Butter˚
 eld (1997) argued that segmentation is 
in˜
 uenced by the possible-word constraints 
(e.g., a stretch of speech lacking a vowel is"
Segment_629,"not   a possible word). For example, listeners found   it hard to identify the word ﬁappleﬂ in ﬁfappleﬂ    because the /f/ could not possibly be an English   word. In contrast, listeners found it relatively   easy to detect the word ﬁappleﬂ in ﬁvuffappleﬂ,   because ﬁvuffﬂ could conceivably be an E",Explores how attention influences cognition.,"perception, awareness, memory",Nested under Chapter on attention,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in emotion,Aligned with contemporary studies on awareness,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_63," not 

a possible word). For example, listeners found 

it hard to identify the word ﬁappleﬂ in ﬁfappleﬂ  

because the /f/ could not possibly be an English 

word. In contrast, listeners found it relatively 

easy to detect the word ﬁappleﬂ in ﬁvuffappleﬂ, 

because ﬁvuffﬂ could conceivably be an English  

word.
Third, there is stress. In English, the initial 
syllable of most content words (e.g., nouns, 

verbs) is typically stressed. When listeners 

heard strings of words without the stress on 

the ˚ rst syllable (e.g., ﬁconduct ascents uphillﬂ)  

presented faintly, they often misheard them 
(Cutler & Butter˚ eld, 1992). For example, ﬁcon-

duct ascents hillﬂ was often misperceived as the  

meaningless, ﬁA duck descends some pill.ﬂ
Fourth, the extent of co-articulation provides 
a useful cue to word boundaries. As mentioned 

above, co-articulation can help the listener to 

anticipate the kind of phoneme that will occur 

next. Perhaps more importantly, there is generally 

more co-articulation within words than between 

them (Byrd & Saltzman, 1998).
Mattys, White, and Melhorn (2005) argued 
persuasively that we need to go beyond simply 

describing the effects of individual cues on word 

segmentation. He put forward a hierarchical 

approach, according to which there are three 

main categories of cue: lexical (e.g., syntax, word 

know 
ledge); segmental (e.g., coarticulation); and 
metrical prosody (e.g., word stress) (see Figure 

9.10). We prefer to use lexical cues (Tier 1) when  

all cues are available. When lexical information 

is lacking or is impoverished, we make use of 

segmental cues such as co-articulation and 

allophony
 (one phoneme may be associated

with two or more similar sounds or allophones) 
(Tier 2). For example, Harley (2008) gives this 

example: the phoneme /p/ can be pronounced 

differently as in ﬁpitﬂ and ﬁspitﬂ. Finally, if 

it is dif˚ cult to use Tier 1 or Tier 2 cues, we 

resort to metrical prosody cues (e.g., stress) 

(Tier 3).
Why do we generally prefer not to use 
stress cues? As Mattys et al. (2005) pointed 

out, stress information is misleading for words 

in which the initial syllable is not stressed (cf., 

Cutler & Butter˚
 eld, 1992).
There is reasonable support for the above 
hierarchical approach. Mattys (2004) found 

that co-articulation (Tier 2) was more useful than 

stress (Tier 3) for identifying word boundaries 

when the speech signal was phonetically intact. 

However, when the speech signal was impover-

ished so that it was hard to use Tier 1 or Tier 2  

cues, stress was more useful than co-articulation. 

Mattys et al. (2005) found that lexical cues 

(i.e., word context versus non-word context) 

were more useful than stress in facilitating 

word segmentation in a no-noise condition. 

However, stress was more useful than lexical 

cues in noise.
Categorical perception
Speech perception differs from other kinds of 

auditory perception. For example, there is a 

de˚
 nite left-hemisphere advantage for perception 
of speech but not other auditory stimuli. There 

is 
categorical perception
"
Segment_631,"of phonemes: speech  stimuli intermediate between two phonemes   are typically categorised as one phoneme or the   other, and there is an abrupt boundary between   phoneme categories.

stimuli intermediate between two phonemes 

are typically categorised as one phoneme or the 

other, and there is an abrupt boundary between 

phoneme categories. For example, the Japanese 

language does not distinguish between / l / and 

/r/. These sounds belong to the same category 

for Japanese listeners, and so they ˚ nd it very 

hard to discriminate between them (Massaro, 

1994).
The existence of categorical perception does 
not
 mean we cannot distinguish at all between 

slightly different sounds assigned to the same 

phoneme category. Listeners decided faster that 

two syllables were the same when the sounds 
were identical than when they were not (Pisoni 

& Tash, 1974).
Raizada and Poldrack (2007) presented 
listeners with auditory stimuli ranging along 

a continuum from the phoneme /ba/ to the 

phoneme /da/. Two similar stimuli were pre-

sented at the same time, and participants decided 

whether they represented the same phoneme. 

Listeners were more sensitive to the differences 

between the stimuli when they straddled the 

category boundary between /ba/ and /da/. The 

key ˚ nding was that differences in brain activa-

tion of the two stimuli being presented were 

strongly 
ampliÞ
 ed
 when they were on opposite 
sides of the category boundary. This ampli˚
 ca-
tion effect suggests that categories are important 

in speech perception.
Context effects: sound 
identiÞ cation
Spoken word recognition involves a mixture 
of bottom-up or data-driven processes triggered 

by the acoustic signal, and top-down or con-

ceptually driven processes generated from 

the linguistic context. Finding that the identi-

˚
cation of a sound or a word is in˜
 uenced by 
the 
context in which it is presented provides 
evidence for top-down effects. However, there

We have seen that listeners show categorical 
perception, with speech stimuli intermediate 

between two phonemes being categorised as 

one phoneme or the other. Ganong (1980) 

wondered whether categorical perception of 

phonemes would be in˜ uenced by context. 

Accordingly, he presented listeners with various 

sounds ranging between a word (e.g., 
dash
) 

and a non-word (e.g., 
tash
). There was a con-

text effect Œ an ambiguous initial phoneme was 

more likely to be assigned to a given phoneme 

category when it produced a word than when 

it did not (the 
lexical identiÞ
 cation shift
).
There are at least two possible reasons why 
context might in˜
 uence categorical perception. 
First, context may have a 
direct
 in˜
 uence on 
perceptual 
processes. Second, context may 
in˜
 uence decision or other processes occurring 
after
 the perceptual processes are completed 

but 
prior
 to a response 
being made. Such 
pro-
cesses can be in˜ uenced by providing rewards 

for correct responses and penalties for incor-

rect ones. Pitt (1995) found that rewards and 

penalties had
 no
 effect on the lexical identi-

˚
 cation shift, suggesting that it depends on 
perceptual processes rather than ones occurring 

subsequently.
Connine (1990) found that the identi˚
 ca-
tion of an ambiguous phoneme is in˜

by Ganong (1980). Sentential context did 
not
 

in˜
 uence phoneme identi˚ cation during initial 
speech perception, but rather affected processes

perception.
In sum, the standard lexical identi˚
 cation 
shift depends on relatively early perceptual 

processes. In contrast, the effects of sentence 

context on the identi˚ cation of ambiguous 

phonemes involve later processes following 

perception.
Phonemic restoration effect
Evidence that top-down processing based on 

the sentence context can be involved in speech 
perception was apparently reported by Warren 

and Warren (1970). They studied the 
phonemic 

restoration effect
. Listeners heard a sentence 

in which a small portion had been removed 

and replaced with a meaningless sound. The 

sentences used were as follows (the asterisk 

indicates a deleted portion of the sentence):
It was found that the *eel was on the
¥
axle.

It was found that the *eel was on the
¥
shoe.

It was found that the *eel was on the
¥
table.

It was found that the *eel was on the
¥
orange.
The perception of the crucial element in
the sentence (e.g., *eel) was in˜ uenced by the 

sentence context. Participants listening to the 

˚
 rst sentence heard ﬁwheelﬂ, those listening to 
the second sentence heard ﬁheelﬂ, and those 

exposed to the third and fourth sentences heard
 
ﬁmealﬂ and ﬁpeelﬂ, respectively. The crucial 

auditory stimulus (i.e., ﬁ*eelﬂ) was always the 

same, so all that differed was the contextual 

information.
What causes the phonemic restoration 
effect? According to Samuel (1997), there are 

two main possibilities:

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
The ˚ ndings appear somewhat inconsistent.  
Samuel (e.g., 1981, 1987) added noise to the 
crucial phoneme or replaced the missing pho-

neme with noise. If listeners processed the missing 

phoneme as usual, they would have heard the 

crucial phoneme plus noise in both conditions. 

As a result, they would have been unable to tell  

the difference between the two conditions. In fact, 

the listeners could readily distinguish between the 

conditions, suggesting that sentence context affects 

processing occurring following perception.
Samuel (1997) used a different paradigm in 
which there was no sentential context. Some 

listeners repeatedly heard words such as ﬁaca-

demicﬂ, ﬁcon˚ dentialﬂ, and ﬁpsychedelicﬂ, all of  

which have /d / as the third syllable. The multiple 

presentations of these words reduce the prob-

ability of categorising subsequent sounds as /d/ 

because of an adaptation effect. In another con-

dition, listeners were initially exposed to the same 

words with the key phoneme replaced by noise 

(e.g., aca*emic; con˚ *entail; psyche*elic). In 

a different condition, the /d/ phoneme was 

replaced by silence. Listeners could have guessed 

the missing phoneme in both conditions. How-

ever, perceptual processes could only have been 

used to identify the missing phoneme in the 

noise condition.

an adaptation effect in the noise condition but 

not in the silence condition. These ˚

In sum, it is likely that the processes under-
lying the phonemic restoration effect vary 

depending on the precise experimental condi-

tions. More speci˚ cally, there is evidence for 

direct effects (Samuel, 1997) and indirect effects 

(Samuel, 1981, 1987).
THEORIES OF SPOKEN 
WORD RECOGNITION
There are several theories of spoken word 
recognition, three of which are discussed here. 
We start with a brief account of the motor 

theory of speech perception originally proposed 

over 40 years ago. However, our main focus 

will be on the cohort and TRACE models, both 

of which have been very in˜uential in recent 

years. The original cohort model (Marslen-

Wilson & Tyler, 1980) emphasised interactions  

between bottom-up and top-down processes 

in spoken word recognition. However, Marslen-

Wilson (e.g., 1990) subsequently revised his 

cohort model to increase the emphasis on 

bottom-up processes driven by the auditory 

stimulus. In contrast, the TRACE model argues 

that word recognition involves interactive top-

down and bottom-up processes. Thus, a crucial  

difference is that top-down processes (e.g., 

context-based effects) play a larger role in the 

TRACE model than in the cohort model.
Motor theory
Liberman, Cooper, Shankweiler, and Studdert-

Kennedy (1967) argued that a key issue in 

speech perception is to explain how listeners 

perceive words accurately even though the 

speech signal provides variable information. In 

their motor theory of speech perception, they 

proposed that listeners mimic the articulatory 

movements of the speaker. The motor signal 

thus produced was claimed to provide much 

less variable and inconsistent information about 

what the speaker is saying than the speech 

signal itself. Thus, our recruitment of the motor  

system f"

Evidence
Findings consistent with the motor theory were 

reported by Dorman, Raphael, and Liberman 

(1979). A tape was made of the sentence, 

ﬁPlease say shopﬂ, and a 50 ms period of 

silence was inserted between ﬁsayﬂ and ﬁshopﬂ. 

As a result, the sentence was misheard as, 

ﬁPlease say chopﬂ. Our speech musculature 

forces us to pause between ﬁsayﬂ and ﬁchopﬂ 

but not between ﬁsayﬂ and ﬁshopﬂ. Thus, the 

evidence from internal articulation would 

favour the wrong interpretation of the last 

word in the sentence.

Fadiga, Craighero, Buccino, and Rizzolatti 
(2002) applied transcranial magnetic stimulation 
(TMS; see Glossary) to the part of the motor 

cortex controlling tongue movements while 

Italian participants listened to Italian words. 

Some of the words (e.g., ﬁterraﬂ) required strong 

tongue movements when pronounced, whereas 

others (e.g., ﬁbaffoﬂ) did not. The key ˚
 nding 
was that there was greater activation of listeners™ 

tongue muscles when 
they were presented with 
words such as ﬁterraﬂ than with words such as  

ﬁbaffoﬂ.
Wilson, Saygin, Sereno, and Iacoboni (2004) 
had their participants say aloud a series of 

syllables and also listen to syllables. As pre-

dicted by the motor theory
, the motor area 
activated when participants were 
speaking was 
also activated when they were 
listening. This  

activated area was well away from 
the classical 
frontal lobe language areas.
The studies discussed so far do not show that 
activity in motor areas is linked 
causally
 to speech 
perception. This issue was addressed by Meister,  

Wilson, Deblieck, Wu, and Iacobini (2007). They 

applied repetitive transcranial magnetic stimu-

lation (rTMS) to the left premotor cortex while 

participants performed a phonetic discrimina-

affected performance 
only
 on the phonetic dis-

crimination task, which involved discriminating 

stop consonants in noise. These ˚
 ndings provide 
reasonable evidence that speech perception is 

facilitated by recruitment of the motor system.
Evaluation
There has been an accumulation of evidence 

supporting the motor theory of speech percep-

tion in recent years (see reviews by Galantucci, 

Fowler, and Turvey, 2006, and Iacoboni, 2008). 

Speech perception is often associated with ac-

tivation of the motor area and motor processes 

can facilitate speech perception. However, we 

must be careful not to exaggerate the importance  

of motor processes in speech perception.
What are the limitations of the motor theory? 
First, the underlying processes are not spelled out. 

For example, it is not very clear 
how
 listeners 
use auditory information to mimic the speaker™s 

articulatory movements. More generally, the 

theory doesn™t attempt to provide a comprehen-

sive account of speech perception.
Second, many individuals with very severely 
impaired speech production nevertheless have 

reasonable speech perception. For example, some 

patients with Broca™s aphasia (see Glossary) 

have effective destruction of the motor speech 

system but their ability to perceive speech is 

essentially intact (Harley, 2008). In addition, 

some mute individuals can perceive spoken 

words normally (Lenneberg, 1962). However, 

the motor theory could account for these ˚
 nd-
ings by assuming the motor movements involved 

in speech perception are fairly abstract and do 

not require direct use of the speech musculature 

(Harley, 2008).
Third, it follows from the theory that 
infants with extremely limited expertise in 

articulation of speech should be very poor 

at speech perception. In fact, however, 6- to 

8-month-old infants perform reasonably well 

on syllable detection tasks (Polka, Rvachew, 

& Molna"

the latter word being excluded when the

sound /d/ is heard.

Processing of the presented word continues
¥
until contextual information and informa-
tion from the word itself are suf˚
 cient to
eliminate all but one of the words in the

word-initial cohort. The uniqueness point

is the point at which the initial part of a

word is consistent with only one word.

However, words can often be recognised

earlier than that because of contextual

information.

Various sources of information (e.g., lexical,
¥
syntactic, semantic) are processed in parallel.

These information sources 
interact
 and
combine with each other to produce an

ef˚
 cient analysis of spoken language.
Marslen-W
ilson and Tyler tested their theoretical 
notions in a word-monitoring task in which 

listeners identi˚
 ed pre-speci˚
 ed target words 
presented within spoken sentences. There were 

normal sentences, syntactic sentences (gram-

matically correct but meaningless), and random 

sentences (unrelated words). The target was a 

member of a given category, a word rhyming 

with a given word, or a word identical to a g"
Segment_639,"iven   word. The dependent variable was the speed   with which the target was detected. According to the original version of the  cohort model, sensory information from the   target word and contextual information from  the rest of the sentence are both used at the   same time. As predicted, complet",Explores how emotion influences cognition.,"awareness, recognition, emotion",Nested under Chapter on emotion,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in awareness,Aligned with contemporary studies on memory,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_220,"iven 

word. The dependent variable was the speed 

with which the target was detected.
According to the original version of the 
cohort model, sensory information from the 

target word and contextual information from 
the rest of the sentence are both used at the 

same time. As predicted, complete sensory 

analysis was not needed with adequate con-

textual information (see Figure 9.11). It was 

only necessary to listen to the entire word when 

the sentence context contained no useful syn-

tactic or semantic information (i.e., random 

condition).
Evidence that the uniqueness point is 
important in speech perception was reported 

by Marslen-Wilson (1984). Listeners were pre-

sented with words and nonwords and decided 

on a lexical decision task whether a word had 

been presented. The key ˚ nding related to non-

words. The later the position of the phoneme 

at which the sound sequence deviated from all 

English words, the more time the listeners took 

to make nonword decisions.
O™Rourke and Holcomb (2002) also 
addressed the assumption that a spoken word 

is identi˚ ed when the uniqueness point is 

reached (i.e., the point at which only
 one
 word 
is consistent with the acoustic signal). Listeners 

heard spoken words and pseudowords and 

decided as rapidly as possible whether each 

stimulus was a word. Some words had an early 

uniqueness point (average of 427 ms after word 

onset), whereas others had a late uniqueness 

point (average of 533 ms after word onset).

Segment_640,"was used as a measure of  the speed of word processing. O™Rourke and Holcomb (2002) found that  the N400 occurred about 100 ms earlier for   words having an early uniqueness point than   for those having a late uniqueness point.

O™Rourke and Holcomb (2002) found that 
the N400 occurred about 100 ms earlier for 

words having an early uniqueness point than 

for those having a late uniqueness point. This is  

important, because it suggests that the unique-

ness point may be signi˚ cant. The further ˚
 nding 
that N400 typically occurred shortly after the 

uniqueness point had been reached supports 

the assumption of cohort theory that spoken 

word processing is highly ef˚
 cient.
Radeau, Morais, Mousty, and Bertelson 
(2000) cast some doubt over the general impor-

tance of the uniqueness point. Listeners were 

presented with French nouns having early or 

late uniqueness points. The uniqueness point 

in˜
 uenced performance when the nouns were 
presented at a slow rate (2.2 syllables /second) 

or a medium rate (3.6 syllables
/second) but not  
when presented at a fast rate (5.6 syllables /

second). This is somewhat worrying given that 

the fast rate is close to the typical conversa-

tional rate of speaking!
There is considerable emphasis in the cohort 
model on the notion of 
competition
 among 

candidate words when a listener hears a word. 

Weber and Cutler (2004) found that such com-

petition can include more words than one might 

imagine. Dutch students with a good command 

of the English language identi˚ ed target pictures 

corresponding to a spoken English word. Even 

though the task was in English, the Dutch 

students activated some Dutch words Œ they 

˚
 xated distractor pictures having Dutch names 
that resembled phonemically the English name 

of the target picture. Overall, Weber and Cutler™s 

˚
 ndings revealed that lexical competition was 
greater in non-native than in native listening.
Undue signi˚
 cance was given to the initial 
part of the word in the original cohort model.

not be recognised if its initial phoneme is unclear  

or ambiguous. Evide"

has been reported. Frauen felder, Scholten, and 

Content (2001) found that French-speaking 

listeners activated words even when the initial 

phoneme of spoken words was distorted (e.g., 
hearing ﬁfocabulaireﬂ activated the word ﬁvocab -

ulaireﬂ). However, the listeners took some 

time to overcome the effects of the mismatch 

in the initial phoneme. Allopenna, Magnuson, 

and Tanenhaus (1998) found that the initial 

phoneme of a spoken word activated other words 

sharing that phoneme (e.g., the initial sounds 

of ﬁbeakerﬂ caused activation of ﬁbeetleﬂ). 

Somewhat later, there was a weaker tendency 

for listeners to activate words rhyming with 

the auditory input (e.g., ﬁbeakerﬂ activated 

ﬁspeakerﬂ). The key point in these studies is 

that some words not sharing an initial phoneme 

with the auditory input were 
not
 totally 

excluded from the cohort as predicted by the 

original cohort model.
Revised model
Marslen-Wilson (1990, 1994) revised the 

cohort model. In the original version, words 

were either in or out of the word cohort. In 

the revised version, candidate words vary in 

their level of activation, and so membership of 

the word cohort is a matter of degree. Marslen-

Wilson (1990) assumed that the word-initial 

cohort may contain words having similar initial  

phonemes rather than being limited 
only
 to 

words having the initial phoneme of the pre-

sented word.
There is a second major difference between 
the original and revised versions of cohort theory. 

In the original version, context in˜
 uenced word 
recognition early in processing. In the revised 

version, the effects of context on word recogni-

tion occur only at a fairly late stage of processing. 

More speci˚ cally, context in˜ uences only the 

integration stage at which a selected word is 

integrated into the evolving representation of the 

sentence. Thus, the revised cohort model places 

more emphasis on bottom-up processing than

clearly superior to the previous assumption 
that membership is all-or-none. Some research 

causing problems for the original version of 

the model (e.g., Allopenna et al., 1998; Frauen-

felder et al., 2001) is much more consistent with  

the revised assumption.
Some of the strongest support for the 
assumption that context in˜ uences only the 

later stages of word recognition was reported 

by Zwitserlood (1989). Listeners performed a 

lexical decision task (deciding whether visually 

presented letter strings were words) immedi-

ately after hearing part of a spoken word. For 

example, when only ﬁcap___ﬂ had been pre-

sented, it was consistent with various possible 

words (e.g., ﬁcaptainﬂ, ﬁcapitalﬂ). Performance 

on the lexical decision task was faster when 

the word on that task was related in meaning 

to either of the possible words (e.g., ﬁshipﬂ 

for ﬁcaptainﬂ and ﬁmoneyﬂ for ﬁcapitalﬂ). Of 

greatest importance was what happened when 

the part word was preceded by a biasing con-

text (e.g., ﬁWith dampened spirits the men 

stood around the grave. They mourned the loss 

of their 
captain
.ﬂ Such context did not prevent 

the activation of competitor words (e.g., 

ﬁcapitalﬂ).
So far we have discussed Zwitserlood™s 
(1989) ˚ ndings when only part of the spoken 

word was presented. What happened when 

enough of the word was presented for listeners 

to be able to guess its identity correctly? 

According to the revised cohort model, we 

should ˚ nd effects of context at this late stage 

of word processing. That"
Segment_643,"is precisely what   Zwitserlood found. Friedrich and Kotz (2007) carried out a  similar study to that of Zwitserlood (1989).

Friedrich and Kotz (2007) carried out a 
similar study to that of Zwitserlood (1989). 
They presented sentences ending with incom-

plete words (e.g., ﬁTo light up the dark she 

needed her can ___ﬂ. Immediately afterwards, 

listeners saw a visual word matched to the 

incomplete word in form and meaning (e.g., 

ﬁcandleﬂ), in meaning only (e.g., ﬁlanternﬂ), 

in form only (e.g., ﬁcandyﬂ), or in neither 

(ﬁnumberﬂ). Event-related potentials (ERPs; 

see Glossary) were recorded to assess the early 

stages of word processing. There was evidence 

for a form-based cohort 250 ms after presenta-

tion of the visual word, and of a meaning-

based cohort 220 ms after presentation. The 

existence of a form-based cohort means that 

ﬁcandyﬂ was activated even though the context 

strongly indicated that it was not the correct 

word. Thus, context did not constrain the 

words initially processed as predicted by the 

revised cohort model.
In spite of the above ˚
 ndings, sentence 
context can in˜ uence spoken word processing 

some time
 before
 a word™s uniqueness point has 

been reached. Van Petten, Coulson, Rubin, Plante, 

and Parks (1999) presented listeners with a 

spoken sentence frame (e.g., ﬁSir Lancelot spared 

the man™s life when he begged for _____ﬂ), 

followed after 500 ms by a ˚ nal word congruent 

(e.g., ﬁmercyﬂ) or incongruent (e.g., ﬁmermaidﬂ) 

with the sentence frame. Van Petten et al. used 

ERPs to assess processing of the ˚
 nal word. 
There were signi˚ cant differences in the N400 

(a negative wave occurring about 400 ms after 

stimulus presentation) to the contextually con-

gruent and incongruent words 200 ms 
before
 

the uniqueness point was reached. Thus, very 

strong context in˜
uenced spoken word pro-
cessing earlier than expected within the revised 

cohort model.

Overall evaluation
The theoretical approach represented by the 
cohort model possesses various strengths. First, 

the assumption that accurate perception of a 

spoken word involves processing and rejecting 

several competitor words is generally correct. 

However, previous theories had typically paid 

little or no attention to the existence of sub-

stantial competition effects. Second, there is the  

assumption that the processing of spoken words 

is sequential and changes considerably during 

the course of their presentation. The speed with 
which spoken words are generally identi˚
 ed 
and the importance of the uniqueness point 

indicate the importance of sequential processing. 

Third, the revised version of the model has two 

advantages over the original version:
The assumption that membership of the 
(1) 
word cohort is a matter of degree rather 

than being all-or-none is more in line with 
the evidence.

There is more scope for correcting errors 
(2) 
within the revised version of the model 
On some trials, the display consisted of four 
different shapes, and so 
only
 a noun was needed 
to specify uniquely the target object. In other 

words, the visual context allowed participants 

to predict that the target would be accurately 

described just by a noun. On every trial, there

petitor was a noun or an adjective. According 

to the cohort model, this competitor should 

have been included in the initial cohort regard-

less of whether it was a noun or an adjective. 

In contrast, if listeners could use context very 

rapidly, they would have 
only
 included the com-

petitor when it was a noun.
The competitor was considered until 800 
ms after word onset (200 ms after word offset) 

when it was a noun (see Figure 9.12). Dramatically, 

however, the competitor was eliminated within 

200 ms of word onset (or never considered at 

all) when it was an adjective.
What do these Þ ndings mean?They cast 
considerable doubt on the assumption that 

context effects occur only after an initial cohort 

of possible words has been established. If the 

context allows listeners to predict accurately 

which words are relevant and which are irrelevant, 

then the effects of context can occur more 

rapidly than is assumed by the cohort model. 

According to Magnuson et al. (2008), delayed 

effects of context are found when the context 

only weakly predicts which word is likely to be 

presented.

because words are less likely to be elimin-
ated from the cohort at an early stage.
What are the limitations of the cohort 
model? First, there is the controversial issue of 

the involvement of context in auditory word 

recognition. According to the revised version 

of the cohort model, contextual factors only 

exert an in˜uence late in processing at the 

integration stage. This is by no means the whole 

story. It may be correct when context only 

moderately constrains word identity but strongly  

constraining context seems to have an impact 

much earlier in processing (e.g., Magnuson et al.,  

2008; Van Petten et al., 1999). However, Gaskell 

and Marslen-Wilson (2002) emphasised the 

notion of ﬁcontinuous integrationﬂ and so can 

accommodate the ˚ nding that strong context 

has early effects.
Second, the modi˚ cations made to the 
original version of the model have made it 

less precise and harder to test. As Massaro 

(1994, p. 244) pointed out, ﬁThese modi˚
 ca-
tions . . . make it more dif˚
 cult to test against 
alternative models.ﬂ
Third, the processes assumed to be involved 
in processing of speech depend heavily on iden-

ti˚
 cation of the starting points of individual 
words. However, it is not clear within the 

theory
 how
 this is accomplished.
TRACE model
McClelland and Elman (1986) and McClelland  

(1991) produced a network model of speech 

perception based on connectionist principles 

(see Chapter 1). Their TRACE model of speech 

perception resembles the interactive activa-

tion model of visual word recognition put 

forward by McClelland and Rumelhart (1981; 

discussed earlier in the chapter). The TRACE 

model assumes that bottom-up and top-down 

processes interact ˜exibly in spoken word 

recognition. Thus, 
all
 sources of information 

are used at the same time in spoken word 

recognition.
The TRACE model is based on the following 
theoretical assumptions:
There are individual processing"

¥ 
nodes at three different levels: features (e.g., 

voicing; manner of production), phonemes, 

and words.

Feature nodes are connected to phoneme 
¥ 
nodes, and phoneme nodes are connected 

to word nodes.

Connections 
¥ 
between
 levels operate in both 
directions, and are only facilitatory.
There are connections among units or nodes
 
¥ 
at the 
same
 level; these connections are 

inhibitory.
Nodes in˜
 uence each other in proportion 
¥ 
to their activation levels and the strengths 

of their interconnections.

As excitation and inhibition spread among 
¥ 
nodes, a pattern of activation or trace 

develops.

The word recognised or identi˚ ed by the 
¥ 
listener is determined by the activation level
 
of the possible candidate words.
The TRACE model assumes that bottom-up 
and top-down processes 
interact 
throughout 
speech perception. In contrast, most versions 

of the cohort model assume that top-down 

processes (e.g., context-based effects) occur 

relatively late in speech perception. Bottom-up 

activation proceeds upwards from the feature 

level to the phoneme level and on to the word 

level, whereas top-down activation proceeds in 

the opposite direction from the word level to the  

phoneme level and on to the feature level.
Evidence
Suppose we asked listeners to detect target 

phonemes presented in words and nonwords. 

According to the TRACE model, performance 

should be better in the word condition. Why 

is that? In that condition, there would be acti-

vation from the word level proceeding to the 

phoneme level which would facilitate phoneme 

detection. Mirman, McClelland, Holt, and 

Magnuson (2008) asked listeners to detect a 

target phoneme (/ t / or / k /) in words and non-

words. Words were presented on 80% or 20% 

of the trials. The argument was that attention 

to (and activation at) the word level would be

greater when most of the auditory stimuli were 
words, and that this would increase the word 

superiority effect.
What did Mirman et al. (2008) ˚
 nd? First, 
the predicted word superiority effect was found 

in most conditions (see Figure 9.13). Second, 

the magnitude of the effect was greater when 

80% of the auditory stimuli were words than 

when only 20% were. These ˚
 ndings provide 
strong evidence for the involvement of top-

down processes in speech perception.
The TRACE model can easily explain the 
lexical identi˚ cation shift (Ganong, 1980). In 

this effect (discussed earlier), there is a bias 

towards perceiving an ambiguous phoneme so 

that a word is formed. According to the TRACE 

model, top-down activation from the word level 

is responsible for the lexical identi˚
 cation shift.
McClelland, Rumelhart, and the PDP (Parallel 
Distributed Processing) Research Group (1986) 

applied the TRACE model to the phenomenon 

of categorical speech perception discussed ear-

lier. According to the model, the discrimination 

boundary between phonemes becomes sharper 

because of mutual inhibition between phoneme 

units at the phoneme level. These inhibitory 

processes produce a ﬁwinner takes allﬂ situation 

in which one phoneme becomes increasingly 
activated while other phonemes are inhibited. 

McClelland et al.™s computer simulation based 

on the model successfully produced categorical 

speech perception.
Norris, McQueen, and Cutler (2003) obtained 
convincing evidence that phoneme identi˚
 ca-
tion can be directly in˜ uenced by top-down 

processing. Listeners were initially presented 

with words ending in the phoneme /f / or /s /. 

For different groups, an ambiguous phoneme 

equally similar to /f / and /s / replaced the ˚
 nal 
/f / or /s / in these words. After that, listeners 

categorised phonemes presented 
on their own
 as  

/f/ or /s/. Listeners who had heard the ambiguous 

phonemes in the context "
Segment_649,"of /s /-ending words   strongly favoured the /s / categorisation. In con-  trast, those who had heard the same phoneme   in the context of /f/-ending words favoured the   /f / categorisation. Thus, top-down learning at   the word level affected phoneme categorisation   as predicted by the TRACE mode",Explores how recognition influences cognition.,"perception, attention, recognition",Nested under Chapter on awareness,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in emotion,Aligned with contemporary studies on attention,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_902,"of /s /-ending words 

strongly favoured the /s / categorisation. In con-

trast, those who had heard the same phoneme 

in the context of /f/-ending words favoured the 

/f / categorisation. Thus, top-down learning at 

the word level affected phoneme categorisation 

as predicted by the TRACE model.
According to the TRACE model, high-
frequency words (those often encountered) are 

processed faster than low-frequency ones partly 

because they have higher resting activation 

levels. Word frequency is seen as having an 

important role in the word-recognition process 

and should in˜ uence even early stages of word 

processing. Support for these predictions was 

reported by Dahan, Magnuson, and Tanenhaus 

(2001) in experiments using eye ˚ xations as a 

measure of attentional focus. Participants were 

presented with four pictures (e.g., bench, bed, 

bell, lobster), three of which had names starting  

with the same phoneme. They clicked on the 

picture corresponding to a spoken word (e.g., 

ﬁbenchﬂ) while ignoring the related distractors 

(bed, bell) and the unrelated distractor (lobster). 

According to the model, more ˚
 xations should 
be directed to the related distractor having a 

high-frequency name (i.e., bed) than to the one 

having a low-frequency name (i.e., bell). That was 

what Dahan et al. found. In addition, frequency 

in˜
 uenced eye ˚ xations very early in processing, 
which is also predicted by the TRACE model.

with the TRACE model. One serious limitation

in˜
 uence of top-down processes on spoken word 
recognition. Frauenfelder, Segui, and Dijkstra 
(1990) gave participants the task of detecting 

a given phoneme. The key condition was one 

in which a nonword closely resembling an 

actual word was presented (e.g., ﬁvocabutaireﬂ 

instead of ﬁvocabulaireﬂ). According to the 

model, top-down effects from the word node 

corresponding to ﬁvocabulaireﬂ should have 

inhibited the task of identifying the ﬁtﬂ in 

ﬁvocabutaireﬂ. They did not.
The existence of top-down effects depends 
more on stimulus degradation than predicted 

by the model. McQueen (1991) presented 

ambiguous phonemes at the end of stimuli, and 

participants categorised them. Each ambiguous 

phoneme could be perceived as completing a 

word or a nonword. According to the model, 

top-down effects from the word level should 

have produced a preference for perceiving the 

phonemes as completing words. This prediction 

was con˚
 rmed 
only
 when the stimulus was 
degraded. It follows from the TRACE model 

that the effects should be greater when the 

stimulus is degraded. However, the absence of 

effects when the stimulus was not degraded is 

inconsistent with the model.
Imagine you are listening to words spoken 
by someone else. Do you think that you would 

activate the spellings of those words? It seems 

unlikely that orthography (information about 

word spellings) is involved in speech perception, 

and there is no allowance for its involvement 

in the TRACE model. However, orthography 

does
 play a role in speech perception. Perre and 

Ziegler (2008) gave listeners a lexical decision 

task (deciding whether auditory stimuli were 

words or nonwords). The words varied in terms 

of the consistency between their phonology 

and their orthography or spelling. This should 

be irrelevant if"

performed the lexical decision task slower 

when the words were inconsistent than when 

they were consistent. Event-related potentials 

(ERPs; see Glossary) indicated that inconsistency 

between phonology and orthography was 

detected rapidly (less than 200 ms).
Finally, we consider a study by Davis, Marslen-
Wilson, and Gaskell (2002). They challenged the 

TRACE model™s assumption that recognising 

a spoken word is based on identifying its 
pho-

nemes
. Listeners heard only the ˚
 rst syllable 
of a word, and decided whether it was the 
only
 
syllable of a short word (e.g., ﬁcapﬂ or the 
Þ
 rst 
syllable of a longer word 
(e.g., ﬁcaptainﬂ). The  

two words between which 
listeners had to 
choose were cunningly selected so that the ˚
 rst 
phoneme was the same 
for both words. Since 

listeners could not use phonemic information 

to make the correct decision, the 
task should 

have been very dif˚
 cult accord
ing to the TRACE 
model. In fact, however, per
formance was good. 
Listeners used non-
phonemic information 
(e.g., 

small differences in syllable duration) ignored 

by the TRACE model to discriminate between 

short and longer words.
Evaluation
The TRACE model has various successes to its 

credit. First, it provides reasonable accounts of 

phenomena such as categorical speech recog-

nition, the lexical identi˚ cation shift, and the 

word superiority effect in phoneme monitoring. 

Second, a signi˚ cant general strength of the 

model is its assumption that bottom-up and 

top-down processes both contribute to spoken 

word recognition, combined with explicit 

assumptions about the processes involved. 

Third, the model predicts accurately some of 

the effects of word frequency on auditory word 

processing (e.g., Dahan et al., 2001). Fourth, 

ﬁTRACE . . . copes extremely well with noisy 

input Œ which is a considerable advantage given 

the noise present in "

What are the limitations of the TRACE

exaggerates the importance of top-down effects 

on speech perception (e.g., Frauenfelder et al., 

1990; McQueen, 1991). Suppose listeners hear

a mispronunciation. According to the model, 
top-down activation from the word level will 

generally lead listeners to perceive the word best 

˚
 tting the presented phonemes rather than the 
mispronunciation itself. In fact, however, mispro-

nunciations have a strong adverse effect on speech 

perception (Gaskell & Marslen-Wilson, 1998).
Second the TRACE model incorporates 
many different theoretical assumptions, which 

can be regarded as an advantage in that it 

allows the model to account for many ˚
 ndings. 
However, there is a suspicion that it makes the 

model so ˜ exible that, ﬁit can accommodate 

any resultﬂ (Harley, 2008, p. 274).
Third, tests of the model have relied heavily 
on computer simulations involving a small 

number of one-syllable words. It is not entirely 

clear whether the model would perform 

satisfactorily if applied to the vastly larger 

vocabularies possessed by most people.
Fourth, the model ignores some factors in˜
 u-
encing auditory word recognition. As we have 

seen, orthographic information plays a signi˚
 cant 
role in speech perception (Perre & Ziegler, 2008). 

In addition, non-phonemic in formation such as  

syllable duration also helps to determine auditory 

word perception (Davis et al., 2002).

In this section, we consider the processesin-

volved in the task of repeating a spoken word 

immediately after hearing it. A major goal of 

research using this task is to identify some of the  

main processes involved in speech perception. 

However, the task also provides useful in-

formation about speech production (discussed 

in Chapter 11).
In spite of the apparent simplicity of the 
repetition task, many brain-damaged patients 

experience difficulties with it even though 
audiometric testing reveals they are not deaf. 

Detailed analysis of these patients suggests vari-

ous processes can be used to permit repetition 

of a spoken word. As we will see, the study of 

such patients has shed light on issues such as 

the following: Are the processes involved in 

repeating spoken words the same for familiar 

and unfamiliar words? Can spoken words be 

repeated without accessing their meaning?
Information from brain-damaged patients 
was used by Ellis and Young (1988) to propose 

a theoretical account of the processing of 

spoken words (see Figure 9.14; a more complete 

˚
 gure of the whole language system is provided 
by Harley, 2008, p. 467). This theoretical account 

(a framework rather than a complete theory) 

has ˚
 ve components:
The

The

 cit in phonemic processing. Such a patient 
would have impaired speech perception for 
words and nonwords, especially those con-

taining phonemes that are hard to discriminate. 

However, such a patient would have generally 

intact speech production, reading, and writing, 

would have normal perception of non-verbal 

environmental sounds not containing phonemes 

(e.g., coughs; whistles), and his/her hearing 

would be unimpaired. The term 
pure word 

deafness
 describes patients with these symp-

toms. There would be evidence for a double 

dissociation if we could ˚ nd patients with 

impaired perception of non-verbal sounds but 

intact speech perception. Peretz et al. (1994) 

reported the case of a patient having a functional 

impairment limited to perception of music and 

prosody.
A crucial part of the de˚ nition of pure word 
deafness is that auditory perception problems 
are highly selective to speech and do 
not
 apply 

to non-speech sounds. Many patients seem to 

display the necessary selectivity. However, Pinard,

(2008) studied a 71-year-old woman with pure 
word deafness, who apparently had no problems 

in identifying environmental sounds in her 

everyday life. However, when asked to count 

rapid clicks, she missed most of them. This 

suggests she had problems in dealing with rapid 

changes in auditory input. Other patients with 

pure word deafness have problems in perceiving 

rapid changes in non-speech sounds with com-

plex pitch patterns (see Martin, 2003). Thus, 

impaired ability to process rapidly changing 

auditory stimuli may help to explain the poor 

speech perception of patients with pure word 

deafness.
Three-route framework
Unsurprisingly, the most important assumption 

of the three-route framework is that there are 

three different ways (or routes) that can be used 

when individuals process and repeat words they 

have just heard. As you can see in Figure 9.14, 

these three routes differ in terms of the number 

and nature of the processes 
used by 
listeners. All  
three routes involve the auditory 
analysis system 
and the phonemic response buffer. Route 1 

involves three additional components o"

language system (the auditory input lexicon, the 

semantic system, and the speech output lexicon), 

Route 2 involves two additional components 

(auditory input lexicon and the speech output 

lexicon), and Route 3 involves an additional rule-

based system that converts acoustic information 

into words that can be spoken. We turn now 

to a more detailed discussion of each route.
According to the three-route framework, 
Routes 1 and 2 are designed to be used with 

familiar words, whereas Route 3 is designed 

to be used with unfamiliar words and non-

words. When Route 1 is used, a heard word 

activates relevant stored information about it, 

including its meaning and its spoken form. 

Route 2 closely resembles Route 1 except that 

information about the meaning of heard words 

is 
not
 accessed. As a result, someone using 
Route 2 would say familiar words accurately 

but would not know their meaning. Finally, 

Route 3 involves using rules about the con-
version of the acoustic information contained 

in heard words into the appropriate spoken 

forms of those words. It is assumed that such 

conversion processes must be involved to allow 

listeners to repeat back unfamiliar words and 

nonwords.
Evidence
If patients could use Route 2 but Routes 1 and 

3 were severely impaired, they should be able 

to understand familiar words but would not 

understand their meaning (see Figure 9.14). 

In addition, they should have problems with 

unfamiliar words and nonwords, because non-

words cannot be dealt with via Route 2. Finally, 

since such patients would make use of the input  

lexicon, they should be able to distinguish 

between words and nonwords.

of word meaning deafness has proved contro-

Franklin, Turner, Ralph, Morris, and Bailey 
(1996) studied Dr O, who was another clear 

case of word meaning deafness. He had impaired 

auditory comprehension but intact written word 

comprehension. His ability to repeat words was 

dramatically better than his ability to repeat 

nonwords (80% versus 7%, respectively). Finally, 

Dr O had a 94% success rate at distinguishing 

between words and nonwords.
Dr O seemed to have reasonable access to 
the input lexicon as shown by his greater ability 

to repeat words than nonwords, and by his 

almost perfect ability to distinguish between

words and nonwords. He clearly has some 
problem relating to the semantic system. How-

ever, the semantic system itself does not seem 

to be damaged, because his ability to under-

stand written words is intact. He probably has 

damage to parts of Route 1. Tyler and Moss 

(1997) argued that Dr O might also have problems 

earlier in processing (e.g., in extracting phonemic 

features from speech). For example, when he 

was asked to repeat spoken words as rapidly 

as possible, he made 25% errors.
According to the theoretical framework, 
we would expect to ˚ nd some patients who make 

use primarily or exclusively of Route 3, which 

involves converting acoustic information from 

heard words into the spoken forms of those words. 

Such patients would be reasonably good at 

repeating spoken words and nonwords but would  

have very poor comprehension of these words.

Roeltgen, Rothi, & Heilman, 1987; Raymer, 

2001). These patients typically have poor reading 

comprehension in addition to impaired auditory 

comprehension, suggesting they have damage 

within the semantic system.
Some brain-damaged patients have extensive  
problems with speech perception and production. 

For example, patients with 
deep dysphasia
 make 
semantic errors when asked to repeat spoken 

words by saying words related in meaning to 

those spoken (e.g., saying ﬁskyﬂ when they hear  

ﬁcloudﬂ). In addition, they ˚ nd it harder to 

repeat abstract words than concrete ones, and 

have a very poor ability to repeat nonwords.
How can we explain deep dysphasia? With 
reference to Figure 9.14, it could be argued 

that none of the routes between heard words 

and speech is intact. Perhaps there is a severe 

impairment to the non-lexical route (Route 3) 

combined with an additional impairment in 

(or near) the semantic system. Other theorists 

(e.g., Jefferies et al., 2007) have argued that the 

central problem in deep dysphasia is a general 

phonological impairment (i.e., problems in 

processing word sounds). This leads to semantic 

errors because it increases patients™ reliance on 

word meaning when repeating spoken words.
Jefferies et al. (2007) found that patients 
with deep dysphasia suffered from poor phono-

logical production on word repetition, reading 

aloud, and spoken picture naming. As pre-

dicted, they also performed very poorly on 

tasks involving the manipulation of phonology 

such as the phoneme subtraction task (e.g., 

r emove the initial phoneme from ﬁcatﬂ). Further-

more, they had problems with speech percep-

tion, as revealed by their poor performance in 

deciding whether two words rhymed with each 

other. In sum, Jefferies et al. provided good 

support for their phonological impairment 

hypothesis.
Evaluation

lines. Patients vary in the preci"

At the very least, it is clear that   repeating spoken words can be achieved in   various different ways.

repeating spoken words can be achieved in 

various different ways. Furthermore, conditions 

such as pure word deafness, word meaning 

deafness and transcortical aphasia can readily 

be related to the framework.
What are the limitations of the framework? 
First, it is often dif˚ cult to decide precisely how 

patients™ symptoms relate to the framework. 

For example, deep dysphasia can be seen as 

involving impairments to all three routes or 

alternatively as mainly re˜ ecting a general phono-

logical impairment. Second, some conditions 

(e.g., word meaning deafness; auditory phono-

logical agnosia) have only rarely been reported 

and so their status is questionable.
transcortical sensory aphasia:
 a disorder in 
which words can be repeated but there are 

many problems with language.

deep dysphasia:
 a condition in which there is 

poor ability to repeat spoken words and 

especially nonwords, and there are semantic 

errors in repeating spoken words.

Several methods are available to study reading. Lexical decision, naming, and priming
tasks have been used to assess word identi˚

detailed on-line information, and is unobtrusive. Studies of masked phonological priming

suggest that phonological processing occurs rapidly and automatically in reading. However,

phonological activation is probably not essential for word recognition.

Reading aloud
¥
According to the dual-route cascaded model, lexical and non-lexical routes are used in

reading words and nonwords. Surface dyslexics rely mainly on the non-lexical route,

whereas phonological dyslexics use mostly the lexical route. The dual-route model

emphasises the importance of word regularity, but consistency is more important. The

model also ignores consistency effects with nonwords and minimises the role of phono-

logical processing. The triangle model consists of orthographic, phonological, and semantic

systems. Surface dyslexia is attributed to damage within the semantic system, whereas

phonological dyslexia stems from a general phonological impairment. Deep dyslexia

involves phonological and semantic impairments. The triangle model has only recently

considered the semantic system in detail, and its accounts of phonological and surface

dyslexia are oversimpli˚
 ed.
Reading: eye-movement research
¥
According to the E-Z Reader model, the next eye-movement is planned when only part

of the processing of the currently ˚
 xated word has occurred. Completion of frequency
checking of a word is the signal to initiate an eye-movement programme, and completion

of lexical access is the signal for a shift of covert attention to the next word. The model

provides a reasonable account of many ˚ 
ndings. However, it exaggerates the extent of
serial processing, and mistakenly predicts that readers will read words in the ﬁcorrectﬂ

order or suffer disruption if they do not.
Listening to speech
¥
Listeners make use of prosodic cues and lip-reading. Among the problems faced by
listeners are the speed of spoken language, the segmentation problem, co-articulation,

individual differences in speech patterns, and degraded speech. Listeners prefer to use

Cohort theory is based on the assumption that perceiving a spoken word involves rejecting

It has been claimed that there are three routes between sound and speech. Patients with pure
word deafness have problems with speech perception that may be due to impaired phonemic

processing. Patients with word meaning deafness have problems in acoustic-to-phonological

conversion and with using the semantic system. Patients with transcranial sensory aphasia

seem to have damage to the semantic system but can use acoustic-to-phonological conversion.

The central problem in deep dysphasia is a general phonological impairment.

INTRODUCTION
Basic processes involved in the initial stages of 

reading and listening to speech were discussed 

in the previous chapter. The focus there was on 

the identiÞ cation of individual words. In this 

chapter, we discuss the ways in which phrases, 

sentences, and entire stories are processed and 

understood during reading and listening.
The previous chapter dealt mainly with 
those aspects of language processing 
differing
 

between reading and listening to speech. In 

contrast, the higher-level processes involved in 

comprehension are somewhat similar whether 

a story is being listened to or read. There has 

been much more research on comprehension 

processes in reading than in listening to speech, 

and so our emphasis will be on reading. However, 

what is true of reading is also generally true 

of listening to speech.
What is the structure of this chapter? At a 
general level, we start by considering com-

prehension processes at the level of the sentence  

and Þ nish by focusing on comprehension 

processes with larger units of language such as 

complete texts. A more speciÞc indication of 

the coverage of this chapter is given below.
There are two main levels of analysis in 
sentence comprehension. First, there is an analysis 

of the syntactical (grammatical) structure of each

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
individuals with high working memory capacity 
exhibit superior language comprehension skills 

to those with low capacity.
In the fourth section of the chapter, we con-
sider some of the processes involved when people 

are presented with a text or speech consisting 

of several sentences. Our focus will be mainly 

on the inferences readers and listeners draw 

during comprehension. We will be considering 

the following important theoretical issue: what 

determines which inferences are and are not 

drawn during language comprehension?
In the Þ fth and Þ nal section of the chapter, 
we consider processing involving larger units 

of language (e.g., texts or stories). When we 

read a text or story, we typically try to
 integrate
 
the information within it. Such integration 

often involves drawing inferences, identifying 

the main themes in the text, and so on. These 

integrative processes (and the theories put 

forward to explain them) are discussed in this 

section.
PARSING
This section is devoted to parsing, and the 

processes used by readers and listeners to com-

prehend the sentences they read or hear. The 

most fundamental issue is to work out 
when
 

different types of information are used. Much of  

the research on parsing concerns the relation-

ship between syntactic and semantic analysis. 

There are at least four major possibilities:
Syntactic analysis generally precedes (an"
Segment_665,"d  (1)  inß  uences) semantic analysis. Semantic analysis usually occurs  (2)  prior  to  syntactic analysis.  Syntactic and semantic analysis occur at  (3)  the same time.  Syntax and semantics are very closely  asso- (4)  ciated, and have a hand-in-glove relation ship  (Altmann, personal communica",Explores how emotion influences cognition.,"awareness, memory, perception",Nested under Chapter on recognition,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in memory,Aligned with contemporary studies on memory,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_287,"d

 uences) semantic analysis.
Semantic analysis usually occurs 
(2) 
prior
 to 
syntactic analysis.

Syntactic and semantic analysis occur at 
(3) 
the same time.

Syntax and semantics are very closely 
asso-
(4) 
ciated, and have a hand-in-glove relation
ship 
(Altmann, personal communication).
The above possibilities will be addressed 
shortly. 
Note, however, that most studies on parsing 
have 
considered only the English language. 
Does this 
matter? Word order is more important 
in English 
than in inß ectional language such as German 

(Harley, 2008). As a result, parsing English 

sentences may differ in important ways from 

parsing German sentences.
Grammar or syntax
An inÞ nite number of sentences is possible in any 

language, but these sentences are nevertheless 

systematic and organised. Linguists such as 

Noam Chomsky (1957, 1959) have produced 

rules to account for the productivity and regu-

larity of language. A set of rules is commonly 

referred to as a grammar. Ideally, a grammar 

should be able to generate all the permissible 

sentences in a given language, while at the same 

time rejecting all the unacceptable ones. For 

example, our knowledge of grammar allows 

us to be conÞ dent that, ÒMatthew is likely to 

leaveÓ, is grammatically correct, whereas the 

similar sentence, ÒMatthew is probable to leaveÓ, 

is not.
Syntactic ambiguity
You might imagine that parsing or assigning

English language (e.g., ÒThey are ß

have an ambiguous grammatical structure. Some 

sentences are syntactically ambiguous at the 
global
 
level, in which case the whole sentence has two 

or more possible interpretations. For example, 

ÒThey are cooking applesÓ, is ambiguous because

One way listeners work out the syntactic 
or grammatical structure of spoken language 
is by using 
prosodic cues
 in the form of stress, 

intonation, and duration. When listeners are 

confronted by speech in which each syllable is 

spoken with equal weight in a monotone (i.e., 

no prosodic cues are present), they Þ nd it hard 

to understand what is being said (Duffy & 

Pisoni, 1992).
Prosodic cues are most likely to be used 
(and are of most value) when spoken sentences 

are ambiguous. For example, in the ambiguous 

sentence, ÒThe old men and women sat on the 

benchÓ, the women may or may not be old. If 

the women are not old, the spoken duration 

of the word ÒmenÓ will be relatively long, and 

the stressed syllable in ÒwomenÓ will have a 

steep rise in pitch contour. Neither of these 

prosodic features will be present if the sentence 

means the women are old.
Implicit prosodic cues seem to be used 
during silent reading. In one study (Steinhauer 

& Friederici, 2001), participants listened to 

or read various sentences. These sentences 

contained intonational boundaries (speech) 

or commas (text), and event-related potentials 

(ERPs; see Glossary) were similar in both cases. 

Other aspects of prosody (e.g., syllable structure; 

number of stressed syllables in a word) inß
 uence 
eye movements and reading time (e.g., Ashby 

& Clifton, 2005).
Frazier, Carlson, and Clifton (2006) argued

important rather than simply what happens at 

one
 particular point in a sentence. For 
example, 

consider the following ambiguous sentence:
I met the daughter (#1) of the colonel 

(#2) who was on the balcony.
There was an intermediate phrase boundary 

at (#2), and the phrase boundary at (1#) was 

larger, the same size, or smaller
. What deter-
mined how the sentence was interpreted was the 

relationship
 between the two phrase boundaries. 

Listeners were most likely to assume that 

the colonel was on the balcony when the Þ
 rst 
boundary was greater than the second one, 
and least likely to do so when the Þ
 rst bound-
ary was smaller than the second.
The above Þ
 ndings conß
 ict with the tradi-
tional view. According to this view, the presence  

of a prosodic boundary (#2) immediately before 

the ambiguously-attached phrase (i.e., who was 

on the balcony) indicates that the phrase should 

not be attached to the most recent potential 

candidate (i.e., the colonel). This view exag-

gerates the importance of a single local phrase 

boundary and minimises the importance of the 

pattern of boundaries.
Snedeker and Trueswell (2003) found that 
listeners rapidly used prosodic cues to attend 

to the relevant objects mentioned by the speaker. 

Indeed, listenersÕ interpretations of ambiguous 

sentences were inß uenced by prosodic cues 

before
 the start of the ambiguous phrase. Thus, 

prosodic cues can be used to predict to-be-

presented information.
In sum, prosody is important in language 
comprehension. As Frazier et al. (2006, p. 248) 

concluded, ÒPerhaps prosody provides the 

structure within which utterance comprehen-

sion takes place (in speech and even in silent 

reading).Ó

assume that 
all
 sources of information (syntactic 
and semantic) are used from the outset to 

construct a syntactic model of sentences. After 

discussing these models, we turn to the unre-

stricted race model, which attempts to combine 

aspects of the garden-path and constraint-

based models.
Garden-path model
Frazier and Rayner (1982) put forward a two-

stage, garden-path model. It was given that 

name because readers or listeners can be misled 

or Òled up the garden pathÓ by ambiguous 

sentences such as, ÒThe horse raced past the 

barn fell.Ó The model is based on the following 

assumptions:
Only 
†
one
 syntactical structure is initially
considered for any sentence.

Meaning is 
†
not
 involved in the selection of
the initial syntactical structure.

The simplest syntactical structure is chosen,
†
making use of two general principles: minimal

attachment and late closure.

According to the principle of minimal
†
attachment, the grammatical structure 
pro-
ducing the fewest nodes (major parts of a

sentence such as noun phrase and verb phrase)

is preferred.

The principle of late closure is that new
†
words encountered in a sentence are attached
to the current phrase or clause if grammatic-

ally permissible.

If there is a conß 
ict between the above two
†
principles, it is resolved in favour of the 

minimal attachment principle.

If the syntactic structure that a reader con-
†
structs for a senten"
Segment_669,"ce during the Þ  rst stage  of processing is incompatible with additional  information (e.g., semantic) generated by a   thematic processor , then there is a second  stage of processing in which the initial   syntactic structure is revised. The principle of minimal attachment can  be illustrated by",Explores how awareness influences cognition.,"perception, attention, emotion",Nested under Chapter on awareness,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in attention,Aligned with contemporary studies on memory,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_641,"ce during the Þ
 rst stage 
of processing is incompatible with additional 
information (e.g., semantic) generated by a 

thematic processor
, then there is a second 
stage of processing in which the initial 

syntactic structure is revised.
The principle of minimal attachment can 
be illustrated by the following example taken 

from Rayner and Pollatsek (1989). In the 

sentences, ÒThe girl knew the answer by heartÓ, 

and, ÒThe girl knew the answer was wrongÓ, 

the minimal attachment principle leads a 

grammatical structure in which Òthe answerÓ 

is regarded as the direct object of the verb 

ÒknewÓ. This is appropriate only for the Þ
 rst 
sentence.
The principle of late closure produces the 
correct grammatical structure in a sentence 

such as, ÒSince Jay always jogs a mile this seems 

like a short distance to himÓ. However, use of 

this principle would lead to an inaccurate 

syntactical structure in the following sentence: 

ÒSince Jay always jogs a mile seems like a short 

distanceÓ. The principle leads Òa mileÓ to be 

placed in the preceding phrase rather than at 

the start of the new phrase. Of course, there 

would be less confusion if a comma were inserted 

after the word ÒjogsÓ. In general, readers are 

less misled by garden-path sentences that are 

punctuated (Hills & Murray, 2000).
Evidence
There is much evidence that readers typically 

follow the principles of late closure and minimal 

attachment (see Harley, 2008). However, the 

crucial assumption is that semantic factors do 

not
 inß uence the construction of the initial 

syntactic structure. Ferreira and Clifton (1986) 

provided support for this assumption in a study 

in which eye movements were recorded while 

readers read sentences such as the following:
Garden-path sentences, such as ﬁThe horse 
raced past the barn fellﬂ, are favourite tools of 

researchers interested in parsing.

The defendant examined by the lawyer

The evidence examined by the lawyer turned
†

According to the principle of minimal attach-

ment, readers should initially treat the verb 

ÒexaminedÓ as the main verb, and so experience 

ambiguity for both sentences. However, if readers
 
initially make use of semantic information, 

they would experience ambiguity only for the 

first sentence. This is because the defendant 

could possibly examine something, but the 

evidence could not. The eye-movement data 

suggested that readers experienced ambiguity 

equally for both sentences, implying that semantic 

information did 
not
 inß uence the initial syntactic 

structure.
ReadersÕ use of late closure was shown by 
Van Gompel and Pickering (2001). Consider 

the following sentence: ÒAfter the child had 

sneezed the doctor prescribed a course of injec-

tionsÓ. Eye-movement data indicated that readers 

experienced a difÞ culty after the word ÒsneezedÓ 

because they mistakenly used the principle of 

late closure to try to make Òthe doctorÓ the direct 

object of ÒsneezedÓ. This shows the powerful 

inß
 uence exerted by the principle of late closure, 
given that the verb ÒsneezedÓ cannot take a 

direct object.
It seems inefÞ cient that readers and listeners 
often construct incorrect grammatical structures 

for sentences. However, Frazier and Rayner 

(1982) claimed that the principles of minimal 

attachment and late closure 
are
 efÞ
 cient because 
they minimise the demands on short-term 

memory. They measured eye movements while 

participants read sentences such as those about 

jogging given earlier. Their crucial argument 

was as follows: if readers construct both (or 

all) possible syntactic structures, then there 

should be additional processing time at the 

point of disambiguation (e.g., ÒseemsÓ in the 

Þ
 rst jogging sentence and ÒthisÓ in the second 
one). Ac"

The eye-movement data consistently supported 

the modelÕs predictions.
Breedin and Saffran (1999) studied a patient,  
DM, who had a very severe loss of semantic 

knowledge because of dementia. However, he 

performed at essentially normal levels on tasks 

involving the detection of grammatical viola-

tions or selecting the subject and object in a 

sentence. These Þ ndings suggest that the syn-

tactic structure of most sentences can be worked 

out correctly in the almost complete absence 

of semantic information. However, the fact that 

DM made very little use of semantic informa-

tion when constructing syntactic structures does 

not necessarily mean that healthy individuals 

do the same.
Readers do not 
always
 follow the principle 
of late closure. Carreiras and Clifton (1993) 

presented English sentences such as, ÒThe spy 

shot the daughter of the colonel who was 

standing on the balconyÓ. According to the 

principle of late closure, readers should inter-

pret this as meaning that the colonel was standing 

on the balcony. In fact, they did not strongly 

prefer either interpretation. When an equivalent 

sentence was presented in Spanish, there was 

a clear preference for assuming that the daughter 

was standing on the balcony (early rather than 

late closure). This is also contrary to theoretical 

prediction.
Semantic information often inß
 uences 
sentence processing earlier than assumed within 

the garden-path model. In some studies, this 

semantic information is contained within the 

sentence being processed, whereas in others

correct syntactic structure. However, Clifton, 
Traxler, Mohamed, Williams, Morris, and Rayner 

(2003) used the same sentences as Trueswell 

et al. but found that semantic information was 

of relatively little use in removing ambiguity!
According to the garden-path model, 
prior 
context
 should not inß uence the initial parsing 

of an ambiguous sentence. However, contrary 

evidence was reported by Tanenhaus, Spivey-

Knowlton, Eberhard, and Sedivy (1995), who 

presented participants auditorily with the 

ambiguous sentence, ÒPut the apple on the 

towel in the boxÓ. They recorded eye move-

ments to assess how the sentence was inter-

preted. According to the model, Òon the towelÓ 

should initially be understood as the place 

where the apple should be put, because that is 

the simplest syntactic structure. That is 
what  

was found when the context did not remove t h e  

ambiguity. However, when the visual context  

consisted of two apples, one on a towel and the  

other on a napkin, the participants rapidly used 

that context to identify which apple to move.
Spivey, Tanenhaus, Eberhard, and Sedivy 
(2002) carried out a similar experiment but used 

pre-recorded digitised speech to prevent speech 

intonation from inß
 uencing participantsÕ inter-
pretations. There were far fewer eye movements 
to the incorrect object (e.g., towel on its own) 

when the context disambiguated the sentence 

(see Figure 10.1), indicating "

Evaluation
The model provides a simple and coherent 

account of key processes in sentence processing.  

There is evidence indicating that the principles 

of minimal attachment and late closure often 

inß
 uence the selection of an initial syntactic 
structure for sentences.
What are the modelÕs limitations? First, the 
assumption that the meanings of words within 

sentences do not inß uence the initial assignment  

of grammatical structure is inconsistent with 

some of the evidence (e.g., Trueswell et al., 1994).  

As we will see later, studies using event-related 

potentials (ERPs; see Glossary) have provided 

strong evidence that semantic information about 

word meanings and about world knowledge 

inß
 uences sentence processing very early in 
processing (e.g., Hagoort et al., 2004).
Second, prior context often seems to inß
 uence 
the interpretation of sentences much earlier in 

processing than assumed by the model. Further 

evidence for that was obtained in an ERP study 

by Nieuwland and van Berkum (2006), which 

is discussed later.
Third, the notion that the initial choice of 
grammatical structure depends only on the 

principles of minimal attachment and late 

closure seems too neat and tidy. For example, 

decisions about grammatical structure are also 

inß
 uenced by punctuation when reading and by 
prosodic cues when listening to speech.
Fourth, the model does not take account 
of differences among languages. For example, 

there is a preference for early closure rather 

than late closure in various languages including 

Spanish, Dutch, and French.
Fifth, it is hard to provide a deÞ
 nitive test 
of the model. Evidence that semantic infor-

mation is used early in sentence processing 

seems inconsistent with the model. However, 

it is possible that the second stage of parsing 

(which includes semantic information) starts 

very rapidly.

Constraint-based theories
There are substantial differences between 
constraint-based theories and the garden-path 

model. According to constraint-based theories, 

the initial interpretation of a sentence depends o n 

multiple sources of informa tion (e.g., syn
tactic, 
semantic, general world knowledge) called 

constraints. These constraints limit the number 

of possible interpretations. There are several 

constraint-based theories. However we will 

focus on the inß uential theory put forward by 

MacDonald et al. (1994).
MacDonald et al.Õs theory is based on a 
connectionist architecture. It is assumed that 

all relevant sources of information are available 

immediately to the parser. Competing analyses 

of the current sentence are activated at the same 

time and are ranked according to activation 

strength. The syntactic structure receiving most 

support from the various constraints is highly 

activated, with other syntactic structures being 

less activated. Readers become confused when 

reading ambiguous sentences if the correct 

syntactic structure is less activated than one or 

more incorrect structures.
According to the theory, the processing 
system uses four language characteristics to 

resolve ambiguities in sentences:
Grammatical knowledge constrains possible 
(1) 
sentence interpretations.

The various forms of information associated 
(2) 
with any given word are typically not 

independent of each other.

A word may be less ambiguous in som"
Segment_675,"e  (3)  ways than in others (e.g., ambiguous for   tense but not for grammatical category).  The various interpretations permissible  (4)  according to grammatical rules generally   differ considerably in frequency and prob-  ability on the basis of past experience.

The various interpretations permissible 
(4) 
according to grammatical rules generally

Evidence
Pickering and Traxler (1998) presented parti-

cipants with sentences such as the following:
As the woman edited the magazine amused  
(1) 
all the reporters.
As the woman sailed the magazine amused 
(2) 
all the reporters.
These two sentences are identical syntactically, 
and both are likely to lead readers to identify 

the wrong syntactic structure initially. However
, 
the semantic constraints favouring the wrong 

structure are greater in sentence (1) than (2). 

As predicted by the constraint-based theory, 

eye-movement data indicated that eye Þ
 xations 
in the verb and post-verb regions were longer 

for those reading sentence (1).
According to the model, the assignment of 
syntactic structure to a sentence is inß
 uenced by  
verb bias
. Many verbs can occur within various 

syntactic structures, but are found more often 

in some syntactic structures than others. For 

example, as Harley (2008) pointed out, the verb 

ÒreadÓ is most often followed by a direct object 

e.g., ÒThe ghost read the book during the plane 

journeyÓ), but can also be used with a sentence 

complement (e.g., ÒThe ghost read the book 

had been burnedÓ). Garnsey, Pearlmutter, Myers, 

and Lotocky (1997) found that readers resolved 

ambiguities and identiÞ ed the correct syntactic 

structure more rapidly when the sentence struc-

ture was consistent with the verb bias. This is 

inconsistent with the garden-path model, accord-

ing to 
which verb bias should not inß
 uence the 
initial identiÞ cation of syntactic structure.
Boland and Blodgett (2001) used noun/verb 
homographs (e.g., duck, train) Ð words that can 

be used as a noun or a verb. For example, if you  

read a sentence that started, ÒShe saw her "
Segment_676,"duck   and . . .Ó, you would not know whether the word   ÒduckÓ was being used as a noun (Ò. . . and   chickens near the barnÓ) or a verb Ò...and   stumble near the barnÓ).

ÒduckÓ was being used as a noun (Ò. . . and 

chickens near the barnÓ) or a verb Ò...and 

stumble near the barnÓ). According to the 

constraint-based approach, readers should 

initially construct a syntactic structure in which 

the homograph is used as its more common 
verb bias:
 a characteristic of many verbs that 
are found more often in some syntactic 

structures than in others.

part of speech (e.g., ÒduckÓ is mostly a verb and 
ÒtrainÓ is mostly a noun). As predicted, readers 

rapidly experienced problems (revealed by eye 

movements) when noun/verb homographs were 

used in their less common form.
Other studies discussed previously provide 
additional support for constraint-based theory. 

For example, there is evidence (e.g., Spivey et al., 

2002; Tanenhaus et al., 1995) indicating that 

prior context inß uences sentence processing at 

an early stage.
Evaluation
The assumption that there can be varying 

degrees of support for different syntactic inter-

pretations of a sentence is plausible. It seems 

efÞ
 cient that readers should use all relevant 
information from the outset when trying to work 

out the syntactic structure of a sentence. As we 

will see, much of the evidence from cognitive 

neuroscience indicates that semantic information 

is used very early on in sentence processing, 

which seems more consistent with the constraint-

based theory than the garden-path model. Finally, 

the constraint-based model assumes there is 

some 
ß exibility
 in parsing decisions because 
several sources of information are involved. In 

contrast, there is little scope for ß
 exibility within

What are the limitations of constraint-based 
theory? First, it is not entirely correct that all 

relevant constraints are used immed iately (e.g., 

Boland & Blodgett, 2001). Second, little is said 

within the theory about the detailed processes 

involved in generating syntactic structures for 

complex sentences. Third, it is assumed that 

various representations are formed in parallel, 

with most of them subsequently being rejected.  

However, there is little direct evidence for the 

existence of these parallel representations. 

Fourth, as Harley (2008, p. 308) pointed out, 

ÒProponents of the garden path model argue 

that the effects that are claimed to support 

constraint-based models arise because the second 
stage of parsing begins very quickly, and that 

many experiments that are supposed to be 

looking at the Þ rst stage are in fact looking at 

the second stage of parsing.Ó
Unrestricted race model
Van Gompel, Pickering, and Traxler (2000) put 

forward the unrestricted race model that com-

bined aspects of the garden-path and constraint-

based models. Its main assumptions are as 

follows:
All sources of information (semantic 
(1) 
as well as syntactic) are used to identify 

a syntactic structure, as is assumed by 

constraint-based models.

All other possible syntactic structures are 
(2) 
ignored unless the favoured syntactic 

structure is disconÞ rmed by subsequent 
information.
If the initially chosen syntactic structure 
(3) 
has to be discarded, there is an extensive 

process of re-analysis before a different 

syntactic structure is chosen. This assump-

tion makes the model similar to the garden-

path model, in that parsing often involves 

two distinct stages.
Evidence
Van Gompel, Pickering, and Traxler (2001) 

compared the unrestricted race model against 

the garden-path and constraint-based models.

during the night. (This sentence involves 
noun-phrase attachment because it must 

have been the dog that had the collar.)
According to the garden-path model, the 
principle of minimal attachment means that 

readers should always adopt the verb-phrase 

analysis. This will lead to rapid processing of 

sentences such as (2) but slow processing of 

sentences such as (3). It allows readers to inter-

pret the ambiguous sentences as rapidly as verb-

phrase sentences, because the verb-phrase analysis 

provides an acceptable interpretation. According 

to the constraint-based theory, sentences such 

as (2) and (3) will be processed rapidly, because 

the meanings of the words support only the 

correct interpretation. However, there will be 

serious competition between the two possible 

interpretations of sentence (1) because both 

are reasonable. As a result, processing of the 

ambiguous sentences will be slower than for 

either type of unambiguous sentence.
In fact, the ambiguous sentences were pro-
cessed 
faster
 than either of the other types of 
sentence, which did not differ (see Figure 10.2). 

Why was this? According to van Gompel et al. 

(2001), the Þ ndings support the unrestricted race 

model. With the ambiguous sentences, 
readers 

rapidly use syntactic and semantic infor 
mation to  "
Segment_679,"form a syntactic structure. Since both syntactic   structures are possible, no re-analysis is necessary.   In contrast, re-analysis is sometimes needed with   noun-phrase and verb-phrase sentences. Van Gompel, Pickering, Pearson, and  Liversedge (2005) pointed out that the study   by van Gompel et",Explores how awareness influences cognition.,"memory, attention, emotion",Nested under Chapter on attention,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in memory,Aligned with contemporary studies on emotion,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_723,"
form a syntactic structure. Since both syntactic 

structures are possible, no re-analysis is necessary. 

In contrast, re-analysis is sometimes needed with 

noun-phrase and verb-phrase sentences.
Van Gompel, Pickering, Pearson, and 
Liversedge (2005) pointed out that the study 

by van Gompel et al. (2001) was limited. More 

speciÞ
 cally, sentences such as (2) and (3) were 
disambiguated some time after the initial point 

of ambiguity. As a result, competition between 

possible interpretations during that interval 

may have slowed down sentence processing. 

Van Gompel et al. (2005) carried out a study 

similar to that of van Gompel et al. (2001) but 

ensured that disambiguation occurred imme-

diately to minimise any competition. Their 

Þ
 ndings were similar to those of van Gompel 
et al. (2001), and thus provided strong support 

for the unrestricted race model.
Evaluation
The unrestricted race model is an interesting 

attempt to combine the best features of the 

garden-path and constraint-based models. It 

seems reasonable that all sources of information 

(including world knowledge) are used from the 

outset to construct a syntactic structure, which 

is then retained unless subsequent evidence is 

inconsistent with it. As we will see shortly, there 

is reasonable cognitive neuroscience evidence 

(e.g., Hagoort et al., 2004) that world know-

ledge inß uences sentence processing at a very 

early stage.
Sentence processing is somewhat more ß
 ex-
ible than assumed within the unrestricted race 

model. As we will see shortly, the thoroughness 

of sentence processing depends in part on 

the readerÕs comprehension goals. In addition, 

ambiguous sentences may be read faster than 

non-ambiguous ones when an easy compre-

hension test is expected but not when a more 

detailed test of comprehension is expected 

(Swets, Desmet, Clifton, & Ferreira, 2008).

have occurred if they had used a more detailed 
comprehension test.
Good-enough representations
Nearly all theories of sentence processing (includ-

ing those we have discussed) have an import-

ant limitation. Such theories are based on the 

assumption that the language processor Ògener-

ates representations of the linguistic input that 

are complete, detailed, and accurateÓ (Ferreira, 

Bailey, & Ferraro, 2002, p. 11). An alternative 

viewpoint is based on the assumption of Ògood-

enoughÓ representations. According to this 

viewpoint, the typical goal of comprehension 

is Òto get a parse of the input that is Ôgood enoughÕ 

to generate a response given the current taskÓ 

(Swets et al., 2008, p. 211).
The Moses illusion (e.g., Erickson & Mattson, 
1981) is an example of inaccurate comprehen-

sion. When asked, ÒHow many animals of each 

sort did Moses put on the ark?Ó, many people 

reply, ÒTwoÓ, but the correct answer is, ÒNoneÓ 

(think about it!). Ferreira (2003) presented 

sentences aurally, and found that our represen-

tations of sentences are sometimes inaccurate 

rather than rich and complete. For example, 

a sentence such as, ÒThe mouse was eaten by 

the cheeseÓ, was sometimes misinterpreted as 

meaning the mouse ate the cheese. A sentence 

such as, ÒThe man was visited by the womanÓ, 

was sometimes mistakenly interpreted to mean 

the man visited the woman.
It follows from the good-enough approach 
of Swets et al. (2008) that readers should 

process sentences more thoroughly if they

rather than superÞ cial comprehension questions. 

As predicted, participants read sentences (espe-

cially syntactically ambiguous ones) more slowly 

in the former case than in the latter. Ambiguous 

sentences were read 
more
 rapidly than non-

ambiguous ones when superÞ
 cial questions 
were asked. However, this ambiguity advantage 

disappeared when more challenging compre-

hension questions were anticipated.
Why are people so prone to error when 
processing sentences (especially passive ones)? 
According to Ferreira (2003), we use heuristics 

or rules of thumb to simplify the task of under-

standing sentences. A very common heuristic 

(the NVN strategy) is to assume that the sub-

ject of a sentence is the agent of some action, 

whereas the object of the sentence is the patient 

or theme. This makes some sense because a 

substantial majority of English sentences con-

form to this pattern.
Cognitive neuroscience
Cognitive neuroscience is making substantial 

contributions to our understanding of parsing 

and sentence comprehension. Since the precise 

timing
 of different processes is so important, 

much use has been made of event-related 

potentials (ERPs; see Glossary). As we will see, 

semantic information of various kinds is actively 

processed very early on, which is broadly con-

sistent with predictions from the constraint-

based theory and the unrestricted race model. 

The evidence is reviewed by Hagoort and van 

Berkum (2007).
The N400 component in the ERP waveform 
is of particular importance in research on sen-

tence comprehension. It is a negative wave with 

an onset at about 250 ms and a peak at about 

400 ms, which is why it is called N400. The 

presence of a large N400 in sentence processing 

typically indicates that there is a 
mismatch
 

between the meaning of the word currently 

being processed and its context. Thus, N400 

reß
 ects aspects of semantic processing.
The traditional "
Segment_682,view assumes that con tex- tual information is processed  after  information  concerning the meanings of words within   a sentence. Evidence against this view was   reported by Nieuwland and van Berkum   (2006).

they used:

had a big smile on his face. The peanut 

was singing about a girl he had just met. 

And judging from the song, the peanut 

was totally crazy about her. The woman

Word meanings and world knowledge in sentence comprehension
How does meaning in˜ uence initial sentence 
construction?The traditional view (e.g., Sperber 

&Wilson, 1986) is that initially we take account 

only of the meanings of the words in the 

s e n tence. Other aspects of meaning that go 

beyond the sentence itself (e.g., our world 

knowledge) are considered subsequently. Con-

vincing evidence against that view was reported 

by Hagoort, Hald, Bastiaansen, and Petersson 

(2004) in a study in which they measured the 

N400 component in the ERP waveform.They 

asked their Dutch participants to read sentences 

such as the following (the critical words are in 

italics):
The Dutch trains are 
(1) 
yellow
 and very 
crowded. (This sentence is true.)

The Dutch trains are 
(2) 
sour
 and very crowded. 
(This sentence is false because of the 

meaning of the word ﬁsourﬂ.)

The Dutch trains are 
(3) 
white
 and very crowded. 
(This sentence is false because of world 

knowledge Œ Dutch trains are yellow.)
According to the traditional view, the 
semantic 
mismatch in a sentence such as (3) 
should have taken longer to detect than the 

mismatch in a sentence such as (2). In fact, 

however, the effects of these different kinds of 

semantic mismatch on N400 were very similar 

(see Figure 10.3). 
What do these ˚ ndings mean? First, ﬁWh"

process word meaning before information

Second, it is noteworthy that word meaning

integrated into the reader™s sentence com-

prehension within about 400 ms.The speed 

with which this happens suggests that sentence 

processing involves making immediate use of 

all relevant information, as is assumed by the 

constraint-based theory of MacDonald et al. 

(1994).

peanut singing and dancing like that. 
The peanut was 
salted /in love, 
and by the 

sound of it, this was deÞ
 nitely mutual.
Some listeners heard ÒsaltedÓ, which was appro-

priate in terms of word meanings but inap-

propriate in the context of the story. Others 
heard Òin loveÓ, which was appropriate in the 

story context but inappropriate in terms of word
 
meanings. The key Þ nding was that the N400 

was greater for ÒsaltedÓ than for Òin loveÓ. 

Thus, contextual information can have a very 

rapid major impact on sentence processing.
Hagoort and van Berkum (2007) discussed 
an unpublished experiment of theirs in which 

participants listened to s"
Segment_684,"entences. Some of these   sentences included a word inconsistent with   the apparent characteristics of the speaker (e.g.,   someone with an upper-class accent saying, ÒI   have a large tattoo on my backÓ). There was a    large N400 to the inconsistent word (ÒtattooÓ).    As Hagoort and van Berkum (",Explores how attention influences cognition.,"attention, recognition, memory",Nested under Chapter on attention,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in awareness,Aligned with contemporary studies on memory,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_303,"entences. Some of these 

sentences included a word inconsistent with 

the apparent characteristics of the speaker (e.g., 

someone with an upper-class accent saying, ÒI 

have a large tattoo on my backÓ). There was a  

large N400 to the inconsistent word (ÒtattooÓ).  

As Hagoort and van Berkum (p. 806) concluded, 

ÒBy revealing an immediate impact of what 

listeners infer about the speaker, the present 

results add a distinctly social dimension to the 

mechanisms of online language interpretation.Ó
Evaluation
Behavioural measures (e.g., time to read a 

sentence) generally provide rather indirect 

evidence concerning the nature and timing of 

the underlying processes involved in sentence 

comprehension. In contrast, research using 

event-related potentials has indicated clearly 

that we make use of our world knowledge, 

knowledge of the speaker, and contextual know-

ledge at an early stage of processing. Such 

Þ
 ndings are more supportive of constraint-based 
theories than of the garden-path model.
PRAGMATICS
Pragmatics is concerned with practical language 

use and comprehension, especially those aspects 

going beyond the literal meaning of what is 

said and taking account of the current social 

context. Thus, pragmatics relates to the
 intended
 
rather than 
literal
 meaning as expressed by 

speakers and understood by listeners, and often 

involves drawing inferences. The literal meaning 

of a sentence is often not the one the writer or 

speaker intended to communicate. For example, 

we assume that someone who says, ÒThe 

weatherÕs really great!Ó, when it has been raining 

non-stop for several days, actually thinks the 

weather is terrible.
We will start by discussing a few examples 
in which the intended meaning of a sentence 

differs from the literal meaning. For example, 

when a speaker gives an indirect and apparently  

irrelevant answer to a question, the listener 

often tries to identify the speakerÕs goals to 

understand wh"
Segment_685,"at he/she means. Consider the   following (Holtgraves, 1998, p. 25): Ken: Did Paula agree to go out with you?  Bob: SheÕs not my type. Holtgraves found that most people interpreted   BobÕs reply in a negative way as meaning that  Paula had not agreed to go out with him but   he wanted to save face.",Explores how perception influences cognition.,"emotion, recognition, perception",Nested under Chapter on attention,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in perception,Aligned with contemporary studies on perception,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_240,"at he/she means. Consider the 

following (Holtgraves, 1998, p. 25):
Ken: Did Paula agree to go out with you?

Bob: SheÕs not my type.
Holtgraves found that most people interpreted 

BobÕs reply in a negative way as meaning that 
Paula had not agreed to go out with him but 

he wanted to save face. Suppose Bob gave an 

indirect reply that did not seem to involve face 

saving (e.g., ÒSheÕ
s my typeÓ). Listeners took 
almost 50% longer to comprehend such indirect 

replies than to comprehend typical indirect 

replies (e.g., ÒSheÕs not my typeÓ), presumably 

because it is hard to understand the speakerÕs 

motivation.
Figurative language
  is language not intended 
to be taken literally. Speakers and writers often 

make use of metaphor, in which a word or 

phrase is used Þ guratively to mean something 

it resembles. For example, here is a well-known 

metaphor from ShakespeareÕs 
Richard III

Theoretical approaches
Much theorising has focused on Þ
 gurative 
language in general and metaphor in particular. 
According to the standard pragmatic model 

(e.g., Grice, 1975), three stages are involved:
The literal meaning is accessed. For example , 
(1) 
the literal meaning of ÒDavid kicked the 

bucketÓ, is that David struck a bucket 

with his foot.

The reader or listener decides whether the 
(2) 
literal meaning makes sense in the context
 
in which it is read or heard.

If the literal meaning seems inadequate, 
(3) 
the reader or listener searches for a non-

literal meaning that does make sense in 

the context.
According to the standard pragmatic model, 

literal meanings should be accessed faster than 

non-literal or Þ gurative ones. Thi"
Segment_686,"s is because   literal meanings are accessed in stage one of   processing, whereas non-literal ones are accessed   only in stage three. Another prediction is that   literal interpretations are accessed automatic-  ally, whereas non-literal ones are optional. In   contrast, Glucksberg (2003) argued t",Explores how recognition influences cognition.,"recognition, memory, attention",Nested under Chapter on recognition,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in memory,Aligned with contemporary studies on awareness,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_74,"s is because 

literal meanings are accessed in stage one of 

processing, whereas non-literal ones are accessed
 
only in stage three. Another prediction is that 

literal interpretations are accessed automatic-

ally, whereas non-literal ones are optional. In 

contrast, Glucksberg (2003) argued that literal 

and metaphoric meanings are processed in 

parallel and involve the same mechanisms.
Giora (1997, 2002) put forward the graded 
salience hypothesis, according to which initial 

processing is determined by salience or pro-

minence rather than by type of meaning (literal 

versus non-literal). According to this hypothesis, 

ÒSalient messages are processed initially, regard-

less of either literality [whether the intended 

meaning is the literal one] or contextual Þ
 t. 
Salience is . . . determined primarily by frequency 

of exposure and experiential familiarity with 

the meaning in question. . . . Salient meanings 

are assumed to be accessed immediately upon 

encounter of the linguistic stimuli via a direct 

lookup in the mental lexicon. Less-salient 

meanings require extra inferential processes, 

and for the most part strong contextual sup-

portÓ (Giora, 2002, pp. 490Ð 491).
Kintsch (2000) put forward a predication 
model of metaphor understanding designed to 
identify the underlying mechanisms. This model 

has two components:
The

This represents the meanings of words

Evidence
Most evidence fails to support the standard

Þ
 gurative or metaphorical meanings are not 
accessed automatically. Opposing evidence 

was reported by Glucksberg (2003). The task 

was to decide whether various sentences were 

literally true or false, and so participants should 

not have accessed the Þ
gurative meaning of 
metaphors (e.g., ÒSome surgeons are butchersÓ). 

In fact, however, participants took a long time 

to judge metaphor sentences as false because 

there was competition between their ÒtrueÓ 

non-literal meaning and their false literal 

meaning (Figure 10.4).
The standard pragmatic model also predicts 
that non-literal meanings should take longer to 

comprehend than literal ones. In fact, however, 

non-literal or metaphorical meanings are typically 

understood as rapidly as literal ones (see Glucks-

berg, 2003). For example, Blasko and Connine 

(1993) presented participants with relatively 

unfamiliar metaphors (e.g., ÒJerry Þ rst knew that 

loneliness was a desert when he was very youngÓ). 

The metaphorical meanings of such sentences 

were understood as rapidly as the literal ones.

expressions were meaningful. Reaction times 
were as fast for conventional metaphors (e.g., 

Òlucid mindÓ) as for literal expressions (e.g., 

Òburning Þ reÓ). Event-related potentials (ERPs; 

see Glossary) indicated that the pattern of brain  

activation was similar for both types of expres-

sion except that the N400 (a wave at 400 ms 

reß
 ecting semantic processing) was greater in 
magnitude with conventional metaphors than 

with literal expressions. These Þ

that the same comprehension mechanisms were

Arzouan et al. (2007) found that reaction 
times were slower for novel metaphors (e.g., 

Òripe dreamÓ) than for conventional metaphors 

or literal expressions. In addition, the amplitude 

of the N400 was greatest for novel metaphors 

and they were the only expressions associated 

with a late negative wave. These Þ
 ndings are 
consistent with the graded salience hypothesis 

Ðnovel metaphors are less salient and familiar

than conventional metaphors and so require 

additional processing.
Giora and Fein (1999) tested the graded 
salience hypothesis more directly using familiar 

metaphors (having salient literal and meta-

phorical meanings) and less-familiar metaphors 

(having a salient literal meaning only). These 

metaphors were presented in a context biasing 

their metaphorical or literal meaning. If salience 

is what matters, then the literal and metaphorical 

meanings of familiar metaphors should be 

activated regardless of context. In contrast, 

the literal meaning of less-familiar metaphors 

should be activated in both contexts, but the 

non-salient metaphorical meaning should not 

be activated in the literal context. The Þ
 ndings 
were exactly as predicted by the hypothesis.
More support for the graded salience hypo-
thesis was reported by Laurent, Denhi‘res, 

Passerieux, Iakamova, and Hardy-Bayl” (2006). 

ERPs were smaller to the last word of strongly 

salient idioms than weakly salient idioms. In 

addition, participants rapidly understood the 

idiomatic meanings of highly salient idioms 

and the literal interpretations of less salient 

idioms. These Þ ndings are consistent with the 

assumption that salient meanings (even of 

idioms) are accessed automatically.
The non-reversibility of metaphors is an 
important phenomenon (see Chiappe & Chiappe, 

2007, for a review). For example, ÒMy surgeon is  

a butcherÓ "
Segment_689,"has a very different meaning to, ÒMy    butcher is a surgeonÓ. This phenomenon can be    accounted for with KintschÕs (2000) predication   model.

accounted for with KintschÕs (2000) predication 

model. According to the model, only those feat-

ures of the predicate (second noun) relevant to the

ing the argument changes the features selected.
KintschÕs predication model also explains 
an interesting Þ nding reported by McGlone 

and Manfredi (2001). Suppose we ask people 

to understand a metaphor such as, ÒMy lawyer 

was a sharkÓ. According to the model, it should 

take longer to understand that metaphor when 

literal properties of sharks (e.g., Òhas Þ
 nsÓ; Òcan

have recently been activated. As predicted, 

McGlone and Manfredi found that the above 

metaphor took longer to understand when

the literal meaning of ÒsharkÓ (e.g., ÒSharks 
c a n swimÓ).
According to KintschÕs predication model, 
our understanding of metaphors depends on 

our ability to
 inhibit
 semantic properties of the 

predicate that are irrelevant to the argument. 

There is much evidence that individuals high 

in working memory capacity (discussed later in  

the chapter) are better than those low in working 

memory capacity at inhibiting potentially dis-

tracting information (see Chiappe & Chiappe, 

2007, for a review). As predicted, Chiappe and 

Chiappe found that participants with high 

working memory capacity interpreted meta-

phors 23% faster "

Evaluation
There has been reasonable progress in under-

standing the processes involved in metaphor 

comprehension. The traditional notion that 

literal meanings are always accessed before 

non-literal ones is inadequate. What actually 

happens is far more 
ß exible
 than was assumed 

in the standard pragmatic model. Selection of the  

appropriate features of the predicate is crucial 

for metaphor understanding. It depends on 

various factors such as salience, prior experience, 

immediate context, and individual differences 

in working memory capacity.
An important limitation of much research 
on metaphor comprehension is that insufÞ
 cient 
attention has been paid to individual differences. 

For example, the Þ
 nding that it takes longer to 
decide that sentences are literally false with meta-

phors than with scrambled metaphors (Glucksberg, 

2003) suggests that metaphorical meanings are 

accessed automatically. Kazmerski, Blasko, and 

Dessalegn (2003) found that 
high-IQ individuals 
accessed metaphorical meanings automatically 

but low-IQ ones did not.
Common ground
Grice (1975) argued that speakers and listeners 

generally conform to the co-operativeness 

principle Ð they work together to ensure mutual 
understanding. In that connection, it is important 

for speakers and listeners to share a common 

ground (shared knowledge and beliefs between 

speaker and listener). Listeners expect that 

speakers will mostly refer to information and 

knowledge that is in the common ground, and 

they may experience comprehension difÞ
 culties 
if that is not the case.
Keysar (e.g., Keysar, Barr, Balin, & Brauner, 
2000) argued for a different theoretical approach 

in his perspective adjustment model. He assumed 

that it can be very effortful for listeners to keep 

working out the common ground existing 

between them and the speaker. Instead, listener"

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
Evidence
Keysar et al. (2000) used a set-up in which a 
speaker and a listener were on opposite sides 

of a vertical array containing 16 slots arranged 

in a 4 
×
 4 pattern. Some slots contained objects 
(e.g., candles, toy cars) and the listenerÕs task 

was to obey the speakerÕs instructions to move 

one of the objects. Some slots were blocked so 

the listener could see the objects in them but 

the speaker could not. For example, in one 

display, the listener could see three candles of 

different sizes but the speaker could see only 

two, with the smallest candle blocked from 

view. What will happen when the speaker says,  

ÒNow put the small candle above it?Ó If the 

listener uses only common ground information, 

he/she will move the smaller of the two candles 

that the speaker can see. However, if the listener 

uses the egocentric heuristic, he/she may initially 

consider the candle the speaker cannot see.
Keysar et al.Õs findings supported the 
perspective adjustment model. The initial eye 

movements "
Segment_692,"were often directed to the object they   could see but the speaker could not, indicating   that they did not consider only the common   ground. In addition, listeners reached for the   object only they could see on 20% of trials, and   actually picked it up on 75% of those trials. Subsequent researc",Explores how awareness influences cognition.,"awareness, memory, emotion",Nested under Chapter on memory,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in attention,Aligned with contemporary studies on memory,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_913,"were often directed to the object they 

could see but the speaker could not, indicating 

that they did not consider only the common 

ground. In addition, listeners reached for the 

object only they could see on 20% of trials, and 

actually picked it up on 75% of those trials.
Subsequent research has suggested that 
w e  rarely make use of the egocentric heuristic. 

Heller, Grodner, and Tanenhaus (2008) pointed 

out that there was a systematic bias in the study  

by Keysar et al. (2000), in that the object only 

the listener could see was a better Þ t to the 

speakerÕs instructions than was the intended 

target object. Heller et al. carried out a similar 

study eliminating that bias. Their participants 

rapidly Þ xated the target object regardless of 

the presence of an object only the listener could 

see. Thus, the participants seemed to have no 

trouble in making use of the common ground.
Barr (2008) found that listeners expected 
speakers to refer to objects in the common 

ground. However, listeners took longer to Þ
 xate 
the target object when there was a competitor 

object visible only to them. How can we inter-

pret these Þ ndings? According to Barr, listenersÕ 

apparent egocentrism reß ects processing limita-
tions rather than neglect of the speakerÕs per-

spective. The processing limitations can cause 

brief interference effects, but listeners rapidly 

focus on the common ground.
Shintel and Keysar (2007) discussed evidence 
that listeners expect speakers to use the same 

term repeatedly when referring to a given object. 

For example, if a speaker describes an object 

to us as an Òelephant rattleÓ on one occasion we  

expect him/her to use the same description in 

future. This could occur because listeners expect 

speakers to maximise the common ground 

between them by using the same terms repeatedly 

and so adhering to the co-operativeness principle. 

However, there is an alternative explanation. 

Perhaps listeners simply ex"
Segment_693,pect speakers to be   consistent  in their utterances regardless of any   considerations of the common ground. Shintel and Keysar (2007) tested the above  hypotheses by having participants watch a video   of the experimenter describing a given object as    an Òelephant rattleÓ or a Òbaby rattleÓ to,Explores how perception influences cognition.,"emotion, awareness, memory",Nested under Chapter on memory,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in awareness,Aligned with contemporary studies on emotion,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_788,"pect speakers to be

 in their utterances regardless of any 

considerations of the common ground.
Shintel and Keysar (2007) tested the above 
hypotheses by having participants watch a video 

of the experimenter describing a given object as  

an Òelephant rattleÓ or a Òbaby rattleÓ to another 

participant in the absence of the experimenter 

(the no-knowledge condition). Other participants 

watched the video in the presence of the experi-

menter (knowledge condition). After that, the 

participants were instructed by the experimenter 

to move the same object that was described in the  

same way as on the video or in a different way. 

The key Þ nding was that it took listeners longer 

to Þ xate the target object when it was described 

differently in both the knowledge and no-

knowledge conditions (see Figure 10.5). Thus, 

listeners expected the experimenter to be con-

sistent whether or not common ground had been 

established between them and the experimenter.
Evaluation
There has been theoretical progress in this area. 

We now know that the distinction between 

common ground and egocentric heuristic 

accounts is oversimpliÞ ed and masks a complex 

reality. Listeners generally expect that speakers 

will make use of the common ground and the 

co-operativeness principle. However, processing  

limitations sometimes prevent listeners from 

focusing only on the common ground. In addi-

tion, Þ ndings that seem to suggest that listeners

expect speakers to adhere to the co-operativeness 
principle are sometimes better explained in 

terms of an expectation that speakers will be 

consistent (Shintel & Keysar, 2007).
What are the limitations of research in this 
area? First, the situations used in several studies 

are highly artiÞ cial. For example, it is unusual

the studies by Keysar et al. (2000) and Heller 

et al. (2008). Such situations may make it hard 

for listeners to focus on the common ground. 

Second, we probably make more use of the 

common ground and less of the egocentric 

heuristic when listening to someone whose 

beliefs are very familiar to us (e.g., a good 

friend) than a stranger in the laboratory. Third, 

it is plausible to assume that listeners typically 

make as much use of the common ground as 

their processing limitations will permit, but 

this assumption has not been tested directly.
INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES: 
WORKING MEMORY 

CAPACITY
There are considerable individual differences 
in almost all complex cognitive activities. 

Accordingly, theories based on the assumption 
that everyone comprehends text in the same 

way are unlikely to be correct. One of the most 

inß
 uential theories of individual differences 
in comprehension was put forward by Just 

and Carpenter (e.g., 1992). They assumed that 

there are individual differences in the capacity 

of working memory, by which they meant a 

system used for both storage and processing 

(see Chapter 6). Within the theory, working 

memory is used for both storage and processing 

during comprehension. Storage and processing 

demands can be heavy, and working memory 

has strictly limited capacity. As a consequence, 

individuals high in working memory capacity 

perform better on comprehension tasks than 

those low in working memory capacity.
The most used method of assessing working 
memory capacity is a task devised by Daneman 

and Carpenter (1980). Participants read a number 

of sentences for comprehension, and then 

try to recall the Þnal word of each sentence. 

The largest number of sentences for which a 

participant can recall all the Þ nal words more

which is a measure of working memory capacity. 
It is assumed that the processes used in 
com-
prehending the sentences require a smaller 

proportion of the available working memory 

capacity of those with a large capacity. As a 

result, they have more capacity for retaining 

the last words of the sentences.
Operation span is another measure of 
working memory capacity. Participants are 

presented with a series of items (e.g., IS (4 
×
 2) 
−
 3 
=
 5? TABLE), and have to answer each 

arithmetical question and remember all the 

last words. 
Operation span
 is the maximum 

number of items for which participants can 

remember all the last words. It correlates 

as highly with language comprehension as 

does reading span. These Þ
 ndings suggest that 
reading span and operation span both assess 

individual differences in general processing 

resources needed for text comprehension (and 

other cognitive tasks).
What accounts for individual differences 
in working memory capacity? One of the most 

inß
 uential theories was put forward by Barrett, 
Tugade,"
Segment_696,"and Engle (2004). They discussed a range   of research Þ ndings suggesting that an important   difference between individuals low and high in   working memory capacity is that the latter have   greater capacity to control attention. Support   for that hypothesis was reported by Kane, Brown,   McVay",Explores how perception influences cognition.,"awareness, memory, recognition",Nested under Chapter on emotion,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in perception,Aligned with contemporary studies on recognition,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_1011," and Engle (2004). They discussed a range 

of research Þ ndings suggesting that an important 

difference between individuals low and high in 

working memory capacity is that the latter have 

greater capacity to control attention. Support 

for that hypothesis was reported by Kane, Brown, 

McVay, Silvia, Myin-Germeys, and Kwapil (2007). 

Their participants were contacted eight times 

a day, and reported immediately whether their 

thoughts had strayed from their current activity. 

During challenging activities requiring much con-

centration, individuals high in working memory 

capacity reported more ability to maintain on-

task thoughts and to avoid mind wandering.
Evidence
How well do reading span and operation span 

predict comprehension performance? This issue 

was addressed by Daneman and Merikle (1996) 

in a meta-analysis of data from 77 studies. 

There were two key Þndings. First, measures 

of working memory capacity (e.g., reading span; 

operation span) predicted comprehension 
performance better than measures of storage 

capacity (e.g., digit span; word span). Second, 

comprehension performance was predicted as 

well by operation span as by reading span. 

Thus, the ability of reading span to predict 

comprehension performance is not simply due 

to the fact that reading span itself involves 

sentence comprehension.
Just and Carpenter (1992) found that whether 
the initial syntactic parsing of a sentence is 

affected by meaning depends on working memory 

capacity. They examined reading times for 

sentences such as, ÒThe evidence examined 

by the lawyer shocked the juryÓ, and, ÒThe 

defendant examined by the lawyer shocked 

the juryÓ. ÒThe evidenceÓ (an inanimate noun) 

is unlikely to be doing the examining, whereas 

Òthe defendantÓ (an animate noun) might well. 

Accordingly, the actual syntactic structure of 

the sentence should come as more of a surprise 

to readers given the second sentence if they 

attend rapidly to meanin"

Later in the chapter we discuss the con-
troversy concerning the extent to which readers 

draw elaborative inferences (those that add 

details not contained in the text). Calvo (2001) 

considered the role of individual differences in 

working memory capacity. Target sentences 

(e.g., ÒThe pupil studied for an hour approxi-

matelyÓ) followed a relevant sentence (predicting 

sentence) or an irrelevant sentence (control 

sentence). It was assumed that individuals who 

form elaborative inferences would Þ nd it easier  

to process the target sentence when it was 

preceded by a predicting sentence. Individuals 

with high working memory capacity spent less 
operation span:

items (arithmetical questions 
+
 words) from 

which an individual can recall all the last words.

time on integrating information from the target 
sentence when it followed a predicting sentence, 

whereas those with low working memory 

capacity did not (see Figure 10.6). The implication 

is that high-capacity individuals rapidly drew 

elaborative inferences but low-capacity indi-

viduals did not.
Working memory capacity is related to the 
ability to inhibit or suppress unwanted infor-

mation (Barrett et al., 2004). The importance 

of this ability was shown by Gernsbacher, 

Varner, and Faust (1990). Participants decided 

whether a given word was related to a previous 

sentence. The crucial condition was one in 

which the word was related to an inappropriate 

meaning of one of the words in the sentence 

(e.g., ÒaceÓ following ÒHe dug with the 

spadeÓ). When the word followed the sentence"

Thus, individuals with high comprehension 

skills can suppress irrelevant information more 

efÞ
 ciently than those with low comprehension

Sachez and Wiley (2006) considered the 
role of working memory capacity in the ability 

to inhibit irrelevant processing. They studied 

the seductive details effect, which is exempliÞ
 ed 
in the tendency for comprehension of a text 

to be reduced if accompanied by irrelevant 

illustrations. Individuals low in working memory 

capacity showed a greater seductive 
details effect 
on text comprehension. In addition,  
their eye 
Þ
 xations indicated that they looked at the irrel-
evant illustrations more often and for longer 

periods of time.
Additional evidence that those high in 
working me
mory capacity are better at focusing  
attention on relevant information was reported 

by Kaakinen, Hyın−, and Keenan (2003). 

Participants read a text on rare diseases con-

taining a mixture of relevant and irrelevant 

information, and only those with high working 

memory capacity allocated extra time to reading 

the relevant information during the initial reading 

of the text.

performance. In addition, the neuroimaging 

evidence revealed three important differences 

between those low and high in working memory 

capacity:
EfÞ
 ciency
(1) 
: High-capacity individuals were 
more efÞ cient. They had less activation 
in bilateral middle frontal and right lingual
 
gyri, suggesting that their planning abilities 

were more efÞ
 cient than those of low-
capacity individuals.

Adaptability
(2) 
: The effects of word frequency 
on brain activation were greater in high-

capacity individuals in several brain areas 

(e.g., middle frontal; inferior occipital).

Synchronisation
(3) 
: High-capacity individuals 
had greater synchronisation of brain 
activation across several brain regions
 
(e.g., left temporal; left inferior frontal; 

left parietal; right occipital). This was 

especially the case when the sentences 

presented on the comprehension task were 

complex.
What do these Þ ndings mean? Individuals 
high in working memory capacity process 

sentences in a more adaptable and synchronised 

way, which is associated with greater efÞ
 ciency. 
As a result, their comprehension abilities are 

greater.
Evaluation
One of the greatest strengths of Just and 

CarpenterÕs (1992) theoretical approach is 

that it emphasised that there are substantial 

individual differences in the processes used in 

language comprehension. For example, whether 

meaning affects initial syntactic parsing (Just 

& Carpenter, 1992) or whether elaborative 

inferences are drawn (Calvo, 2001) can depend 

on individual differences in working memory 

capacity. For reasons that are not clear to us, 
most theorists have studiously avoided incor-

porating individual differences into their theories. 

Of particular importance for the future is the 

cognitive neuroscience approach (e.g., Prat 

et al., 2007). It offers the prospect of clarifying 

the processing differences between low- and

What are the limitations of research in this 
area? First, individuals low and high in working 

memory capacity also differ in other ways (e.g., 

reading span correlates about 
+
0.6 with verbal 
intelligence (Just & Carpenter, 1992)). As a 

r esult, differences between low- and high-capacity 

individuals may reß ect verbal intelligence rather 

than simply working memory capacity.
Second, the cognitive processing of low- 
and high-capacity individuals differs in several 

ways (Baddeley, 2007). We have focused on 

differences in attentional control and ability 

to inhibit irrelevant information. However, 

high-capacity individuals also have larger 

vocabularies than low-capacity individuals 

(Chiappe & Chiappe, 2007), and it is often 

hard to know precisely why high-capacity indi-

vidualsÕ comprehension performance surpasses 

that of low-capacity individuals.
DISCOURSE PROCESSING
So far we have focused mainly on the processes 

involved in understanding individual sentences. 

In real life, however, we are generally presented 

with connected 
discourse
 (written text or speech 

at least several sentences in length). What are 

the main differences? According to Graesser, 

Millis, and Zwaan (1997, p. 164), ÒA sentence 

out of context is nearly always ambiguous, 

whereas a sentence in a discourse context is 

rarely ambiguous. . . . Both stories and everyday 

experiences include people performing actions 

in pursuit of goals, events that present obstacles 
discourse:
 connected text or speech generally 
at least several sentences long.

taken from Rumelhart and Ortony (1977):
Mary heard the ice-cream van coming.
(1) 
She remembered the pocket money.
(2) 
She rushed into the house.
(3) 
You probably made various inferences while 
reading the story. For example, Mary wanted 

to buy some ice-cream; buying ice-cream costs 

money; Mary had some pocket money in the 

house; and Mary had only a limited amount 

of time to get hold of some money before the 

ice-cream van appeared. Note that none of 

these inferences is explicitly stated.
There are three main types of inferences: 
logical inferences, bridging inferences, and 

elaborative inferences. 
Logical inferences
 depend 
only on the meanings of words. For example, 

we can infer that anyone who is a widow is 

female. 
Bridging inferences
 establish coherence
 
between the current part of the text and the 

preceding text, and so are also known as back-

ward inferences. 
Elaborative inferences
 embellish 

or add details to the text by making use of 

our world knowledge. They are sometimes 

known as forward 
inferences because they often 
involve 
anticipating the future. As Harley (2008) 
pointed out, a major theoretical problem is to 

work out how we typically manage to access 

relevant
 information from our huge store of 

world knowledge when forming elaborative 

inferences.
Readers generally draw logical and bridging 
inferences because they are essential for under-

standing. What is more controversial is the 

extent to which non-essential or elaborative 

inferences are drawn automatically. Singer 

(1994) compared the time taken to verify a 

test sentence (e.g., ÒA dentist pulled a toothÓ) 
following one of three contexts: (1) the in-

formation had already been explicitly pre-

sented; (2) a bridging inference was needed 

to understand the test sentence; and (3) an

times in conditions (1) and (2) were fast and 

the same, suggesting that the bridging inference 

was drawn automatically during comprehen-

sion. 
However, veriÞ cation times were signiÞ
 -
cantly slower in condition (3), presumably 

because the elaborative inference was not drawn 

automatically.
Garrod and Terras (2000) studied the pro-
cesses involved in bridging inferences. For a start, 

let us consider the following two sentences:
Keith drove to London yesterday.

The car kept overheating.
You had no trouble (hopefully!) in linking these 

sentences based on the assumption that Keith 

drove to London in a car that kept overheating.  
Garrod and Terras argued that there are two 
possible explanations for the way in which the 

bridging inference could be made. First, reading
 
the verb ÒdroveÓ in the Þ rst sentence may activate 

concepts relating to driving (especially ÒcarÓ). 

Second, readers may form a representation of 

the entire situation described in the Þ
 rst sen-
tence, and then relate information in the second 

sentence to that representation. The crucial 

difference is that the sentential context is irrel-

evant in the Þ rst explanation but is highly 

relevant in the second explanation.
logical inferences:
 inferences depending solely 
on the meaning of words.

bridging inferences:
 inferences that are drawn 

to increase the coherence between the current 

and preceding parts of a text; also known as 

backward inferences.

elaborative inferences:
 inferences that add 

details to a text that is being read by making use 

of our general knowledge; also known as forward 

inferences.

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
Garrod and Terras (2000) tried to distin-
guish between these two possibilities. They 
recorded eye movements while participants 

read a sentence such as, Ò"
Segment_703,"However, she was   disturbed by a loud scream from the back of   the class and the pen dropped on the ß  oorÓ.  This sentence was preceded by a sentence about   a teacher writing a letter or writing on a black-  board.

disturbed by a loud scream from the back of 

the class and the pen dropped on the ß
 oorÓ. 
This sentence was preceded by a sentence about 

a teacher writing a letter or writing on a black-

board. If context is important, participants should 

have found it harder to process the word ÒpenÓ  

when the previous sentence was about writing 

on a blackboard rather than writing a letter. 

In fact, the initial Þ xation on the word ÒpenÓ 

was uninß uenced by context. However, particip-

ants spent longer going back over the sentence 

containing the word ÒpenÓ when the preceding 

context was inappropriate.
What do the above Þ ndings mean? According 
to Garrod and Terras, there are 
two
 stages in 

forming bridging inferences. The Þ
 rst stage 
is 
bonding
, a low-level process involving the 
automatic activation of words from the preceding 

sentence. The second stage is 
resolution
, which 

involves making sure the overall interpretation 

is consistent with the contextual information. 

Resolution is inß uenced by context but bonding 

is not.
Anaphor resolution
Perhaps the simplest form of bridging inference 

is 
anaphor resolution
, in which a pronoun or 
noun has to be identiÞ ed with a previously 

mentioned noun or noun phrase. Here is an 

example: ÒFred sold John his lawnmower, and 

then he sold him his garden hoseÓ. It requires 

a bridging inference to realise that ÒheÓ refers 

to Fred rather than John. How do people make 

the appropriate anaphoric inference? Sometimes 

gender makes the task very easy (e.g., ÒJuliet 

sold John her lawnmower, and then she sold 

him her garden hoseÓ). Sometimes the number 

of the noun (singular versus plural) provides 

a useful cue (e.g., ÒJuliet and her friends sold 

John their lawnmower, and then they sold him 

their garden hoseÓ).
Evidence that gender information makes 
anaphor resolution easier was reported by 
Arnold, Eisenband, Brown-Schmidt, and Trues-

well (2000). Participants looked"
Segment_704,at pictures while   listening to text. Gender information (ÒheÓ or   ÒsheÓ) was used more rapidly to look at the   appropriate picture when it contained a male   and a female character than when it contained   two same-sex characters. Anaphor resolution is also easier when  pronouns are in the expe,Explores how memory influences cognition.,"emotion, attention, recognition",Nested under Chapter on memory,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in awareness,Aligned with contemporary studies on recognition,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_877," at pictures while 

listening to text. Gender information (ÒheÓ or 

ÒsheÓ) was used more rapidly to look at the 

appropriate picture when it contained a male 

and a female character than when it contained 

two same-sex characters.
Anaphor resolution is also easier when 
pronouns are in the expected order. Harley 

(2001) provided the following example:
Vlad sold Dirk his broomstick because he 
(1) 
hated it.

Vlad sold Dirk his broomstick because he 
(2) 
needed it.
The Þ rst sentence is easy to understand because
 
ÒheÓ refers to the Þ rst-named man (i.e., Vlad). 

In contrast, the second sentence is relatively 

hard to understand because ÒheÓ refers to the 

second-named man (i.e., Dirk).
Nieuwland and van Berkum (2006) asked 
participants low and high in working memory 

capacity to read sentences varying in the extent 

to which the context biased one interpretation 

of the pronoun:
No bias
(1) 
: Anton forgave Michael the problem 
because his car was a wreck.

Strong bias
(2) 
: The businessman called the 
dealer just as he left the trendy club.
Nieuwland and van Berkum used event-related  
potentials (ERPs; see Glossary) to assess pro-

noun processing. There were two main Þ
 ndings
 
(see Figure 10.7). First, individuals high in 

working memory capacity were more likely to 

take account of the two possible interpretations 

of the pronoun, indicating that they were more 

sensitive to subtleties of language. Second, there 

was a smaller probability of processing both 
anaphor resolution:
 working out the referent 
of a pronoun or noun by relating it to some 

previously mentioned noun or noun phrase.

Constructionist approach
Everyone agrees that various elaborative infer-

ences are made while we read text or listen to 

speech. However, there has been much theoretical 

controversy concerning the number and nature 

of the elaborative inferences typically drawn. 

The constructionist approach originally pro-

posed by Bransford (e.g., Bransford, Barclay, 

& Franks, 1972) represents a major theoretical 

position that inß
 uenced subsequent theoretical 
accounts (e.g., the constructionÐintegration 
model, the event-indexing model, and the 

experiential-simulations approach discussed 

later). Bransford argued that readers typically 

construct a relatively complete Òmental modelÓ 

of the situation and events referred to in the 

text. A key implication of the constructionist 

approach is that numerous elaborative infer-

ences are typically drawn while reading a text.
Most early research supporting the con-
structionist position involved using memory 

tests to assess inference drawing. For example, 

Bransford et al. (1972) presented participants 

with sentences such as, ÒThree turtles rested 

on a ß oating log, and a Þ sh swam beneath 

themÓ. They argued that participants would 

draw the inference that the Þ sh swam under 

the log. To test this, some participants on a 

subsequent recognition-memory test were given 

the sentence, ÒThree turtles rested on a ß
 oating 
log, and a Þ
 sh swam beneath itÓ. Most parti
-
cipants were conÞ
 dent this inference was the 
original sentence. Indeed, their level of con-

Þ
 dence was as high as it was when the original 
sentence was re-presented on the memory test!

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
Bransford et al. concluded that inferences from 
text are typically stored in memory just like 

information actually presented in the text.
Memory tests provide only an 
indirect
 
measure of inferential processes. The potential 

problem is that any inferences found on a 

memory test may be made at the time of test 

rather than during reading. Indeed, many infer-

ences found on memory tests reß
 ect recon-
structive processes occurring during retrieval. 

Evidence that elaborative inferences are often 

not drawn during initial reading is discussed 

in the next section in connection with the mini-

malist hypothesis. Before proceeding, however, 

note that the extent to which elaborative infer-

ences are drawn depends very much on the 

readerÕs goals. Calvo, Castillo, and Schmalhofer 

(2006) instructed some participants to read 

sentences for comprehension, whereas others 

were explicitly told to try to anticipate what 

might happen next. Participants in the latter 

condition drew more elaborative inferences 

than those in the former condition. Even when 

participants reading for compreh"
Segment_707,"ension drew   elaborative inferences, they did so more slowly   than those in the anticipation condition. Minimalist hypothesis The constructionist position has come under   increasing attack over the years. McKoon and   Ratcliff (1992) challenged this approach with   their  minimalist hypothesis :",Explores how recognition influences cognition.,"memory, attention, perception",Nested under Chapter on emotion,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in memory,Aligned with contemporary studies on awareness,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_1300,"ension drew 

elaborative inferences, they did so more slowly 

than those in the anticipation condition.
Minimalist hypothesis
The constructionist position has come under 

increasing attack over the years. McKoon and 

Ratcliff (1992) challenged this approach with 

their 
minimalist hypothesis
: ÒIn the absence of 
speciÞ
 c, goal-directed strategic processes, infer-
ences of only two kinds are constructed: those 

that establish locally coherent representations 

of the parts of a text that are processed con-

currently and those that rely on information 

that is quickly and easily availableÓ (p. 440).
Here are the main assumptions made by 
McKoon and Ratcliff (1992):
Inferences are either automatic or strategic 
† 
(goal directed).

Some automatic inferences establish local 
† 
coherence (two or three sentences making 

sense on their own or in combination with 

easily available general knowledge). These 
inferences involve parts of the text in working 
memory at the same time (this is working 
memory in the sense of a general-purpose 

capacity rather than the Baddeley multiple-

component working memory system dis-

cussed in Chapter 6).

Other automatic inferences rely on informa-
† 
tion readily available because it is explicitly 

stated in the text.

Strategic inferences are formed in pursuit 
† 
of the readerÕ
s goals; they sometimes serve 
to produce local coherence.

Most elaborative inferences are made at 
† 
recall rather than during reading.
The greatest difference between the 
minimalist hypothesis and the constructionist 

position concerns the number of automatic 

inferences formed. Constructionists claim that 

numerous automatic inferences are drawn in 

reading. In contrast, those favouring the mini-

malist hypothesis argue that there are strong 

constraints on the number of inferences gener
-
ated automatically.
Evidence
Dosher and Corbett (1982) obtained evidence 

supporting the distinction between automatic 

and strategic inferences."
Segment_708,"They focused on   instrumental inferences (e.g., ÒMary stirred her   coffeeÓ has ÒspoonÓ as its instrumental infer-  ence). In order to decide whether participants   generated these instrumental inferences during   reading, Dosher and Corbett used an unusual   procedure.

instrumental inferences (e.g., ÒMary stirred her 

coffeeÓ has ÒspoonÓ as its instrumental infer-

ence). In order to decide whether participants 

generated these instrumental inferences during 

reading, Dosher and Corbett used an unusual 

procedure. The time taken to name the colour 

in which a word is printed is slowed down if 

the word has recently been activated. Thus, if 

presentation of the sentence, ÒMary stirred her 

coffeeÓ, activates the word ÒspoonÓ, this should 

increase the time taken to name the colour in 

which the word ÒspoonÓ is printed. There was 

no evidence that the instrumental inferences 

had been formed with normal reading instruc-

tions. However, those inferences were formed 

when the participants guessed the instrument 

in each sentence as it was presented.
What do the above Þ ndings mean? First, 
whether an inference is drawn can depend on

the readerÕs intentions or goals, which is one 
of the central assumptions of the minimalist 

hypothesis. In other words, strategic inferences 

were formed but automatic ones were not. 

Second, the Þ ndings go against the construc-

tionist position. We need to infer the instrument  

used in stirring coffee to achieve full under-

standing, but such instrumental inferences were 

not
 drawn under normal reading conditions. 

The Þ ndings of Calvo et al. (2006) discussed 

earlier also support the hypothesis that the 

readerÕs goals inß uence whether elaborative 

inferences are drawn.
McKoon and Ratcliff (1992) assumed that 
automatic inferences are drawn to establish 

local coherence for information contained in 

working memory. However, global inferences 

(inferences connecting widely separated pieces 

of textual information) are not drawn auto-

matically. They presented short texts containing 

a global goal (e.g., assassi"
Segment_709,"nating a president)   and one or two local or subordinate goals (e.g.,   using a riß e; using hand grenades). Active use   of local and global inferences was tested by   presenting a test word after each text, with   participants instructed to decide rapidly whether   it had appeared in the text.

and one or two local or subordinate goals (e.g., 

using a riß e; using hand grenades). Active use 

of local and global inferences was tested by 

presenting a test word after each text, with 

participants instructed to decide rapidly whether 

it had appeared in the text.
What did McKoon and Ratcliff (1992) Þ
 nd? 
Local inferences were drawn automatically, but 

global inferences were not. These Þ
 ndings are 
more consistent with the minimalist hypothesis 

than with the constructionist position, in which 

no distinction is drawn between local and 

global inferences.
McKoon and Ratcliff (1992) pointed out 
that most studies reporting large numbers of 

elaborative inferences had used memory tests 

to assess inference drawing. Thus, the inferences 

may have been drawn at the time of the memory 

test rather than during reading. Supporting 

evidence was reported by Dooling and Chris-

tiaansen (1977). Some participants read a story 

about a ruthless dictator called Gerald Martin, 

and one week later were given a test of recogni-

tion memory. They were told just before the 

memory test that the story had really been 

about Adolf Hitler. This led them mistakenly 

to ÒrecogniseÓ sentences relevant to Hitler that 
had not appeared in the original story. The 

inferences about Hitler leading to false recogni-

tion could not have been drawn while the story 

was being read but must have been drawn just 

before or during the memory test. A somewhat 

similar study by Sulin and Dooling (1974) is 

discussed shortly.
Readers sometimes draw more inferences 
during reading than predicted by the minimalist 

hypothesis. For example, it is assumed by the 

minimalist hypothesis that readers do not 

generally infer the main goals. Poynor and 

Morris (2003) compared texts in which the 

goal of the protagonist [principal character] 

was explicitly stated or only implied. Later 

in the text there was a sentence in which the 

protagonist ca"

inconsistent with his / her goal. Readers took 

longer to read a sentence describing an incon-

sistent action than one describing a consistent 

action, regardless of whether the goal was 

explicit or implicit. Thus, readers inferred 

the protagonistÕs goal even when it was only 

implied.
According to the minimalist hypothesis, 
readers do not draw predictive inferences, 

which involve inferring what will happen next 

on the basis of the current situation. Contrary 

evidence was reported by Campion (2004), 

who presented readers with texts such as the 

following:
It was a pitch black night and a gigantic 

iceberg ß oated in the ocean, emerging 

by only Þ 
ve metres. The helmsman was 
attentive, but the ship advanced towards 

the iceberg and ran into it, causing a 

terrible noise.
What do you think happened next? Campion 

found that readers drew the predictive inference 

that the ship sank. However, this inference was
 
made somewhat tentatively. This was shown 

by the additional Þ nding that readers were slow 

to read the follow-up sentence: ÒWhat a big 

mistake, as the ship went down at sea.Ó Campion 

pointed out that predictive inferences were not 

drawn in previous research when predictable

events were only weakly associated with text 
information in the readerÕs knowledge.
Individual differences have been ignored 
in most of the research. Murray and Burke 

(2003) considered inference drawing in partici-

pants with high, moderate, or low reading 

skill. They were tested on predictive inferences 

(e.g., inferring ÒbreakÓ when presented with 

a sentence such as ÒThe angry husband threw 

the fragile vase against the wallÓ). All three 

groups showed some evidence of drawing 

these predictive inferences. However, these

Evaluation
The minimalist hypothesis clariÞ es which infer-

ences are drawn automatically when someone 

is reading a text. In contrast, constructionist 

theorists often argue that inferences needed 

to understand fully the situation described in 

a text are drawn automatically. This is rather 

vague, as there could be differences in opinion 

over exactly what information needs to be 

encoded for full understanding. There is 

evidence that the distinction between automatic 

and strategic inferences is an important one. 

Another strength of the minimalist hypothesis 

is the notion that many inferences will be 

drawn only if consistent with the readerÕs goals. 

Finally, many of the studies reporting more 

elaborative inferences than predicted by the 

minimalist hypothesis are ß awed because of 

their reliance on memory tests, which provide 

a very indirect assessment of processing during 

reading.
What are the limitations of the minimalist 
hypothesis? First, we cannot always predict 

accurately from the hypothesis 
which
 inferences 

will be drawn. For example, automatic infer-

ences are drawn if the necessary information 

is Òreadily availableÓ, but how do we establish 

t he precise degree of availability of some piece of  

information? Second, the minimalist hypothesis 

is 
too
 minimalist and somewhat underestimates 
the inferences drawn from text (e.g., Campion, 

2004; Poynor & Morris, 2003). Third, neither 

the minimalist nor the constructionist approach 

provides an adequate account of individual 

differences in inference drawing (e.g., Murray 

& Burke, 2003).
We end this evaluation section with the 
following reasonable conclusion proposed by 

Graesser et al. (1997, p. 183): ÒThe minimalist 

hypothesis is probably correct when the reader

STORY PROCESSING
If someone asks us to describe a story or book 

we have read recently, we discuss the major 

events and themes and leave out the minor 

details. Thus, our description is highly 
selective
, 
depending on the meaning extracted from the 

story while reading it and on selective processes 

operating at retrieval. Imagine our questionerÕs 

reaction if our description were 
not
 selective, 

but simply involved recalling random sentences 

from the story!
Gomulicki (1956) showed how selectively 
stories are comprehended and remembered. One 

group of participants wrote a pr”cis (a summary) 

of a story visible in front of them, and a second 

group recalled the story from memory. A third 

group was given each pr”cis and recall, and 

found it very hard to tell them apart. Thus, 

story memory resembles a pr”cis in that people 

focus on important information.
Our processing of stories or other texts 
involves relating the information in the text to 

relevant structured knowledge stored in long-

term memory. What we process in stories, how 

we process information in stories, and what 

we remember from stories we have read all 

depend in part on such stored information. We 

will initially consider theories emphasising

the importance of
 schemas
, which are well-
integrated packets of knowledge about the 

world, events, people, and actions. After that, 

we will turn to theories identifying in more 

detail the processes occurring when someone 

reads or listens to a story.
Schema theories
The schemas stored in long-term memory include"
Segment_713,"what are often referred to as  scripts  and  frames .  Scripts deal with knowledge about events and   consequences of events.

what are often referred to as 
scripts 
and 
frames
. 
Scripts deal with knowledge about events and 

consequences of events. For example, Schank 

and Abelson (1977) referred to a restaurant 

script, which contains information about the 

usual sequence of events involved in having a 

restaurant meal. In contrast, frames are know-

ledge structures relating to some aspect of the 

world (e.g., building). They consist of Þ
 xed 
structural information (e.g., has ß
 oors and 
walls) and slots for variable information 

(e.g., materials from which the building is 

constructed). Schemas are important because 

they contain much of the knowledge used to 

facilitate understanding of what we hear and 

read.
Schemas allow us to form 
expectations
. 
In a restaurant, for example, we expect to be 

shown to a table, to be given a menu by the 

waiter or waitress, to order food and drink, 

and so on. Schemas help us to make the world 

relatively predictable, because our expectations 

are generally conÞ
 rmed.
Evidence that schemas can inß
 uence story 
comprehension was reported by Bransford and 

Johnson (1972, p. 722). Here is part of the 

story they used:
The procedure is quite simple. First, you 

arrange items into different groups. 

Of course one pile may be sufÞ
 cient 
depending on how much there is to do. 

If you have to go somewhere else due to 

lack of facilities, that is the next step; 

otherwise, you are pretty well set. It is 

important not to overdo things. That is, 

it is better to do too few things at once 

than too many.
What on earth was that all about? Participants 
hearing the passage in the absence of a title 

rated it as incomprehensible and recalled an 

average of only 2.8 idea units. In contrast, those
 
supplied beforehand with the title ÒWashing 
clothesÓ found it easy to understand and recalled
 
5.8 idea units on average. Relevant schema

BartlettÕs theory
Bartlett (1932) was the Þ rst psychologist to argue 

persuasively that schemas play an important 

role in determining what we remember from 

stories. According to him, memory is affected 

not only by the presented story but also by the 

participantÕs store of relevant prior schematic 

knowledge. Bartlett had the ingenious idea of 

presenting people with stories producing a 

conß ict
 between what was presented to them 

and their prior knowledge. If, for example, 

people read a story taken from a different 

culture, prior knowledge might produce dis-

tortions in the remembered version of the story, 

making it more conventional and acceptable 

from the standpoint of their own cultural 

background. BartlettÕs findings supported his 

predictions. A substantial proportion of the 

recall errors made the story read more like a 

conventional English story. He used the term 

rationalisation
 to refer to this type of error.
Bartlett (1932) assumed that memory for 
the precise material presented is forgotten 

over time, whereas memory for the underlying 
schemas:
 organised packets of information 
about the world, events, or people stored in 

long-term memory.

rationalisation:
 in Bartlett™s theory, the 

tendency in recall of stories to produce errors 

conforming to the cultural expectations of the 

rememberer.

schemas is not. As a result, rationalisation

should increase at longer retention intervals.

However, Bartlett failed to give very   speciÞ  c instructions: ÒI thought it best, for the  purposes of these experiments, to try to inß  uence  the subjectsÕ procedure as little as possibleÓ   (p. 78).

speciÞ
 c instructions: ÒI thought it best, for the 
purposes of these experiments, to try to inß

(p. 78). As a result, some distortions observed 

by Bartlett were due to conscious guessing 

rather than deÞ cient memory. This was shown 

by Gauld and Stephenson (1967) using ÔThe 

War of the GhostsÕ. Instructions stressing the 

need for accurate recall (and thus presumably 

reducing deliberate guessing) eliminated almost 

half the errors usually obtained.
In spite of problems with BartlettÕs pro-
cedures, evidence from well-controlled studies 

has conÞ rmed his major Þ ndings. This was 

done by Bergman and Roediger (1999) using 

ÔThe War of the GhostsÕ. They found that 

participants had more rationalisation errors in 

their recall of the story after six months than 

after one week or 15 minutes.
Sulin and Dooling (1974) also supported 
BartlettÕs Þ ndings. They presented some 
parti-
cipants with a story about Gerald Martin: ÒGerald 

Martin strove to undermine the existing govern-

ment to satisfy his political 
ambitions. . . . He 

became a ruthless, 
uncontrollable dictator
. The 
ultimate effect of 
his rule was the downfall of 

his countryÓ (p. 256). Other participants were 
given the same story, but the main character 

was 
called Adolf Hitler. Those participants 
presented with the story about Adolf Hitler 

were much more likely than the other particip-

ants to believe incorrectly that they had read 

the sentence, ÒHe hated the Jews particularly 

and so persecuted them.Ó Their schematic know-

ledge about Hitler distorted their recollections 

of what they had read (see Figure 10.8). As 

Bartlett (1932) predicted, this type of distortion 

was more common at a long than a short reten-

tion interval, because 
schematic information is 

more long-lasting than 
information contained 
in the text.

Most of the research discussed so far used 
artiÞ
 cially constructed texts and the particip-
ants deliberately learned the material. Brewer 
and Treyens (1981) wondered whether schemas 

inß
 uence memory when information is acquired 
incidentally in a naturalistic situation. Their 

participants spent 35 seconds in a room resem-

bling a graduate studentÕs ofÞ ce before the 

experiment proper took place (see Figure 10.9). 

The room contained schema-consistent objects 

you would expect to Þ nd in a graduate studentÕs 

ofÞ
 ce (e.g., desk, calendar, eraser, pencils) and 
schema-inconsistent objects (e.g., a skull, a toy 

top). Some schema-consistent objects (e.g., books) 

were omitted.
After the participants moved to another 
room, they were unexpectedly tested on their 

memory for the objects in the Þ rst room. Many 

of them initially provided written free recall of 

all the objects they could remember, followed 

by a recognition memory test including words 

referring to objects, some of which had been 

present in the room and some of which had 

not. There were three main Þ
 ndings:
Participants recalled more schema-"

Objects that had 
(2) 
not
 been present in the 
room but were ÒrecognisedÓ with high 

conÞ
 dence were nearly all highly schema-
consistent (e.g., books, Þ
 ling 
cabinet). 
This is clear evidence for schemas leading 

to errors in memory
.
Most participants recognised many more 
(3) 
objects than they recalled. The objects 

recognised with high conÞ dence that were 
most likely to have been recalled were 

ones very consistent with the room schema
 
(e.g., typewriter). This suggests that the 

schema was used as a retrieval mechanism 

to facilitate recall.
Bartlett (1932) assumed that memorial 
distortions occur mainly because of schema-

driven reconstructive processes operating at 

retrieval. However, we have seen that schemas 

can inß uence comprehension processes (Bransford 

& Johnson, 1972) when a story is very difÞ
 cult 
to understand. In addition, as Bartlett pre-

dicted, schemas often inß uence the retrieval 

of information from long-term memory. For 

example, Anderson and Pichert (1978) asked 

participants to read a story from the perspec-

tive of a burglar or of someone interested in 

buying a home. After they had recalled the 

story, they shifted to the alternative perspective 

and recalled the story again. On the second 

recall, participants recalled more information 

that was important only to the second perspec-

tive or schema than they had done on the Þ
 rst 
recall (see Figure 10.10).
Altering the perspective produced a shift 
in the schematic knowledge accessed by the 

participants (e.g., from knowledge of what 

burglars are interested in to knowledge of what  

potential house buyers are interested in). Accessing 

different schematic knowledge enhanced recall, 

and thus provides support for the notion of 

schema-driven retrieval.

organised. At the upper level of the hierarchy, 
there are relatively large structures involving 

schemas and scripts. At the lower level, there 

are more speciÞc units of information. If that 

assumption is correct, we might expect some 

brain-damaged patients would have greater 

problems with accessing lower-level informa-

tion than schema- or script-based information. 

There should also be others who Þ nd it harder 

to use schema or script information than lower-

level information.
Which brain-damaged patients have special 
problems with accessing concept-based in-

formation? Many are patients with semantic 

dementia (see Glossary and Chapter 7). This is 

a condition involving severe problems accessing 

the meanings of words and objects but good 

executive functioning in the early stages of 

deterioration. Funnell (1996) found that EP, 

a patient with semantic dementia, retained 

reasonable access to script knowledge. For 

example, when the next research appointment 

was being arranged, EP went to the kitchen 

and collected her calendar and a ballpoint pen. 

EP also used a needle correctly when given 

a button to sew on to a shirt. However, her 

performance was extremely poor when tested 

on the meanings of common objects (e.g., ball-

point pen, needle, scissors). On one task, each 

object was presented with two additional objects, 

one of which was functionally associated with 
the use of the target objects (e.g., the ballpoint 

pen was presented with a pad of writing paper 

and a small printed book). She performed at 

chance level when instructed to select the func-

However, she showed evidence of script memory",Explores how emotion influences cognition.,"recognition, emotion, awareness",Nested under Chapter on awareness,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in perception,Aligned with contemporary studies on perception,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_1077,"ciated object.
Similar Þ ndings with another semantic 
dementia patient, KE, were reported by Snowden, 

GrifÞ
 ths, and Neary (1994). KE found it difÞ
 cult  
to identify and use her own objects when they 

moved to an unusual location in her home. 

However, she showed evidence of script memory 

by carrying out everyday tasks appropriately 

and by using objects (e.g., clothes pegs) correctly 

when in their usual location (e.g., her own peg-

bag). Other patients with semantic dementia 

show impaired script memory for relatively 

simple tasks (e.g., knowing how to cook; cutting 

the lawn) (Hodges & Patterson, 2007).
What brain-damaged patients have greater 
problems with accessing script-related infor-

mation than lower-level knowledge? Scripts 

typically have a goal-directed quality (e.g., 

to achieve the goal of having an enjoyable 

restaurant meal), and executive functioning 

within the prefrontal cortex is very useful in 

constructing and implementing goals. Sirigu, 

Zalla, Pillon, Grafman, Agid, and Dubois (1995)  

asked patients with prefrontal damage to generate 

and evaluate several types o f

Cosentino, Chute, Libon, Moore, and Gross-
man 
(2006) studied patients with 
fronto-temporal 
dementia
. This is a condition involving degener-

ation of the frontal lobe of the brain and often 

also parts of the temporal 
lobe, and is generally 
associated with poor 
complex planning and  
sequencing. These patients 
(as well as those with 
semantic dementia and healthy controls) were 

presented with various scripts. Some scripts con-

tained sequencing errors (e.g., dropping Þ sh in a  

bucket occurring 
before
 casting the Þ
 shing line), 
whereas others contained semantic or meaning 

errors (e.g., placing a ß ower on the hook in a 

story about Þ
 shing). Patients with semantic 
dementia and healthy controls both made as 

many sequencing errors as semantic ones (see 

Figure 10.11). In contrast, the temporo-frontal 

patients with poor executive functioning failed 

to detect almost twice as many sequencing 

errors as semantic ones. Thus, these patients 

had relatively intact lower-level semantic know-

ledge of concepts combined with severe impair-

ment of script-based knowledge.
Overall evaluation
Our organised schematic knowledge of the 

world is used to help text comprehension 

and recall. In addition, many of the errors and 

distortions that occur when we try to remember  

texts or stories are due to the inß
 uence of 
schematic information. There is plentiful evidence

consistent with the notion that the knowledge

What are the limitations of schema research? 
First, it has proved hard to identify the charac-

teristics of schemas. For example, there is no 

straightforward way to work out how much

extent to which that information is integrated.

terms of the activation of certain schemas, we

independent
 evidence of the existence 
(and appropriate activation) of those schemas. 

However, such evidence is generally not avail-

able. As Harley (2008, p. 384) pointed out, 

ÒThe primary accusation against schema and 

script-based approaches is that they are nothing 

more than re-descriptions of the data.Ó
Third, the conditions determining 
when

cesses should lead to the generation "

Kintsch™s construction Œ integration 
model
Walter Kintsch (1988, 1998) put forward a 
constructionÐintegration model specifying in 

some detail the processes involved in compre-

hending and remembering story information. 

It incorporates aspects of schema-based theories 

and Johnson-LairdÕs mental model approach 

(see Chapter 14). KintschÕs model assumes story 

comprehension involves forming propositions. 

A 
proposition
 is a statement making an assertion 
or denial; it can be true or false.
There is much evidence for the importance 
of propositions. Kintsch and Keenan (1973) 

varied the number of propositions in sentences 

while holding the number of words approxi-

mately constant. An example of a sentence with 

four propositions is: ÒRomulus, the legendary 

founder of Rome, took the women of the 

Sabine by force.Ó In contrast, the following 

sentence contains eight propositions: ÒCleopatraÕs 

downfall lay in her foolish trust of the Þ
 ckle 
political Þ gures of the Roman world.Ó The 

reading time increased by about one second 

for each additional proposition. This suggests 
that the sentences were processed proposition 

by proposition almost regardless of the number 

of words per proposition.
Ratcliff and McKoon (1978) also provided 
evidence for the existence of propositions. They 

presented sentences (e.g., ÒThe mausoleum that 

enshrined the tsar overlooked the squareÓ), 

followed by a recognition test in which parti-

cipants decided whether test words had been 

presented before. For the example given, the 

test word ÒsquareÓ was recognised faster when 

the preceding test word was from the same 

proposition (e.g., Ò"
Segment_723,"mausoleumÓ) than when it   was closer in the sentence but from a different   proposition (e.g., ÒtsarÓ). The basic structure of KintschÕs constructionÐ integration model is shown in Figure 10.12.   According to the model, the following states   occur during comprehension: Sentences in the text are t",Explores how recognition influences cognition.,"emotion, recognition, awareness",Nested under Chapter on perception,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in memory,Aligned with contemporary studies on emotion,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_843,"mausoleumÓ) than when it 

was closer in the sentence but from a different 

proposition (e.g., ÒtsarÓ).
The basic structure of KintschÕs constructionÐ
integration model is shown in Figure 10.12. 

According to the model, the following states 

occur during comprehension:
Sentences in the text are turned into pro-
†
positions representing the meaning of the

text.

These propositions are entered into a short-
†
term buffer and form a 
propositional net
.

Each proposition constructed from the text
†
retrieves a few associatively related proposi-

tions (including inferences) from long-term

memory.

The propositions constructed from the text
†
plus those retrieved from 
long-term
 
memory
jointly form the 
elaborated propositional
net
. This net usually contains many irrelevant
propositions.

A spreading activation process then selects
†
propositions for the text representation.

Clusters of highly interconnected proposi-

tions attract most activation and have the

greatest probability of inclusion in the text

representation. In contrast, irrelevant pro-

positions are discarded. This is the 
inte-

gration process
.

The

 is an organised

;
information about the relationship between
any two propositions is included if they

were processed together in the short-term

buffer. W
ithin the text representation, it is
hard to distinguish between propositions

based directly on the text and propositions

based on inferences.

As a result of these various processes, three
†
levels of representation are constructed:

representations or models).
The constructionÐintegration model may 
sound rather complex, but its key assumptions 

are straightforward. The processes involved in 

the construction of the elaborated propositional 

net are relatively 
inefÞ
 cient
, with many irrelevant 
propositions being included. This is basically 

a bottom-up approach, in that the elaborated 

propositional net is constructed without taking 

account of the context provided by the overall 
theme of the text. After that, the integration 

process uses contextual information from the 

text to weed out irrelevant propositions.
How do the assumptions of the constructionÐ
integration model differ from those of 

other models? According to Kintsch, Welsch, 

Schmalhofer, and Zimny (1990, p. 136), ÒMost 

other models of comprehension attempt to specify 

strong, ÔsmartÕ rules which, guided by schemata, 

arrive at just the right interpretations, activate 

just the right know ledge, and generate just the 

right inferences.Ó These strong rules are generally 

very complex and insufÞ
 ciently ß exible. In 
contrast, the weak rules incorporated into the 

constructionÐintegration model are robust and 

can be used in virtually all situations.
Evidence
Kintsch et al. (1990) tested the assumption that 

text processing produces three levels of repre-

sentation ranging from the surface level based 

directly on the text, through the propositional 

level, to the situation or mental model level 

(providing a representation similar to the one 

that would result from actually experiencing 

the situation described in the text). Participants 

read brief descriptions of various situations, 

and then their recognition memory was tested 

immediately or at times ranging up to four 

days later.

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
The forgetting functions for the surface, 
propositional, and situational representations 
were distinctively different (see Figure 10.13). 

There was rapid and complete forgetting of the  

surface representation, whereas information 

from the situational representation showed no 

forgetting over four days. Propositional infor-

mation differed from situational information 

in that there was forgetting over time, and it 

differed from surface information in that there 

was only partial forgetting. As predicted, the 

most complete representation of the textÕs 

meaning (i.e., the situation representation) was 

best remembered, and the least complete 

representation (i.e., the surface representation) 

was the worst remembered.
Another prediction of the model is that 
readers with more relevant knowledge should 

construct deeper levels of representation of 

a text than less knowledgeable ones. Caillies, 

Denhi‘re, and Kintsch (2002) presented texts 

describing the use of software packages to 

individuals whose knowledge ranged from non-

existent to advanced. As predicted, intermediate  

and advanced individuals showed superior text 

comprehension to the beginners. However, on 

another memory test (recognition memory for 

parts of the text), the beginner group actually 

performed 
better
 than the other groups. Why was 
this? The beginners had focused mainly on form-

ing a 
surface representation which was perfectly 
adequate for good recognition memory.
The readerÕs goals help to determine which 
r epresentations are formed. Zwaan (1994) argued 

that someone reading an excerpt from a nov"
Segment_726,"el   may focus on the text itself (e.g., the wording;   stylistic devices) and so form a strong surface   representation. In contrast, someone reading   a newspaper article may focus on updating his/  her representation of a real-world situation,   and so form a strong situation representation. As",Explores how emotion influences cognition.,"emotion, awareness, recognition",Nested under Chapter on emotion,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in perception,Aligned with contemporary studies on emotion,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_1266,"el 

may focus on the text itself (e.g., the wording; 

stylistic devices) and so form a strong surface 

representation. In contrast, someone reading 

a newspaper article may focus on updating his/

her representation of a real-world situation, 

and so form a strong situation representation. As  

predicted, memory for surface representations 

was better for stories described as literary, 

whereas memory 
for situation representations 

was better for stories described as newspaper 

reports (see Figure 10.14).
It is assumed within the model that inference 
processing involves a generation process (in 

which possible inferences are produced) and a 

subsequent integration process (in which the 

most appropriate inference is included in the 

text representation). Mason and Just (2004) 

obtained support for this part of the model in a  

brain-imaging study. When the generation process  

increased in difÞ culty, there was increased 

activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, 

suggesting that this brain area is involved in 

generating inferences. In contrast, increased 

difÞ
 culty in the integration process was associated 
with increased activity in the right-hemisphere 

language area including the inferior, middle, and 

superior temporal gyri and the angular gyrus. 

Thus, different brain areas are associated with 

the generation and integration processes.

base . . . top-down factors, such as reading per-

spective or reading goal, exert their inß
 uence 
at the integration phase.Ó It seems implausible 

that this is what 
always
 happens. Suppose you 

read a text that discusses four rare diseases. 

You are asked to imagine that a close friend 

has been diagnosed with one of those diseases, 

and your task is to inform common friends 

about it. It seems likely that this reading goal 

would cause you to spend a relatively long time 

processing relevant sentences (i.e., dealing with 

your friendÕs disease) and relatively little time pro-

cessing irrelevant sentences. This is precisely what 

Kaakinen and Hyın− found. The Þ
 nding that 
reading goal inß uenced the early stages of text 

processing suggests strongly that top-down 

factors can inß
 uence the 
construction phase 
as well as the integration 
phase, which is incon-
sistent with the model.
Evaluation
The constructionÐintegration model has the 

advantage over previous theories that the ways 

in which text information combines with the 

readerÕs related knowledge are spelled out 

in more detail. For example, the notion that 

propositions for the text representation are 

selected on the basis of a spreading activ-

ation process operating on propositions drawn 

from the text and from stored knowledge is 

an interesting one. Another strength is that 
According to the constructionÐintegration 
model, textual information is Þ rst linked with 

general world or semantic knowledge. After 

that, it is linked to contextual information from  

the rest of the text. Cook and Myers (2004) 

tested this assumption using various passages. 

Here is an excerpt from one passage:

On the Þ rst day of Þ
 lming, ÒAction!Ó 
was called by the actress so that 

shooting could begin . . . 
What was of interest was how long the readers

appropriate in terms of our knowledge, which

However
, the context of the passage (in italics) 
provides a reason why it might not be the 

director who is in charge. According to the

ledge that actresses do not direct Þ

event-indexing model, to which we next turn.
Event-indexing model
According to the event-indexing model (Zwaan 

& Radvansky, 1998), readers monitor Þ
 ve aspects  
or indexes of the evolving situation model at 

the same time when they read stories:
The protagonist
(1)

the previous one.

Spatiality
(4) 
: the relationship between the 
spatial setting of the current event and a 

previous event.

Intentionality
(5) 
: the relationship between the
 
characterÕs goals and the present event.
As readers work through a text, they con-
tinually update the situation model to reß
 ect 
accurately the information presented with respect
 
to all Þ ve aspects or indexes. 
Discontinuity 

(unexpected changes) in any of the Þ
 ve aspects 
there is reasonable evidence for the three levels 

of representation (surface, propositional, and 

situation) speciÞ ed in the model. Finally, it is 

predicted accurately that readers will often Þ
 nd 
it hard to discriminate between information 

actually presented in a text and inferences 

based on that information (as in the study by 

Bransford et al., 1972). The reason is that very 

similar propositions are formed in either 
case.
What are the modelÕs limitations? First, the 
assumption that only bottom-up processes 

are used during the construction phase of 

text 
processing is dubious. One implication 
o f  that assumption is that readers only engage 

in 
selective
 processing based on top-down pro-
cesses at the subsequent integration phase. The 

Þ
 nding that readersÕ goals can lead them to 
allocate visual attention selectively very early 

in text processing (Kaakinen and Hyın−, 2007) 

indicates that text processing is more ß
 exible 
than assumed by Kintsch.
Second, it is assumed that only general world 
and semantic knowledge is used in addition to 

text information during the formation of pro-

positions in the construction phase. However, 

the notion that other sources of information 

(e.g., contextual information) are used 
only
 at 

the integration phase was disproved by Cook 

and Myers (2004).
Third, the assumption that readers invariably  
construct several propositions when reading a 

text has not received strong "
Segment_730,"support. We will   see later that some theorists (e.g., Kaup, Yaxley,    the only meaningful representation formed is   a perceptual simulation  resembling a situation  representation. Fourth, Graesser et al. (1997) argued that  Kintsch ignored two levels of discourse repre-  sentation.

We will 

see later that some theorists (e.g., Kaup, Yaxley, 


the only meaningful representation formed is 

a perceptual simulation

Fourth, Graesser et al. (1997) argued that 
Kintsch ignored two levels of discourse repre-

sentation. One is the 
text genre level
, which is 

concerned with the nature of the text (e.g., 

narrative, description, jokes, exposition). The 

other is the 
communication level
, which refers 

to the ways in which the writer communicates 

with his/her readers. For example, some writers 

present themselves as invisible story-tellers.

resonance view, the time should be longer in the  
re-enablement condition than in the enablement 

condition because outdated information inter-

feres with processing the target sentence. The 

Þ
 ndings were as predicted by the here-and-now 
view.
Claus and Kelter (2006) found that readers 
often update their knowledge even when it is 

effortful. Participants were presented with 

passages describing four events that occurred 

in a given chronological order. In some passages, 

the events were not presented in the correct 

order Ð the Þ rst event was presented 
after
 the 

second and third events. Thus, the Þ
 rst event 
was a ß ashback. The duration of the second 

event was short (e.g., ÒFor half an hour they 

ß

ÒFor Þ ve hours they ß y above the countrysideÓ).

readers put the four events in the correct chrono-

Evaluation
The greatest strength of the event-indexing 

model is that it identiÞ es key processes involved 

in creating and updating situation models. As 

predicted, reading times increase when readers 

respond to changes in any of the Þ
 ve indexes 
or aspects. The modelÕs emphasis on the con-

struction of situation models is probably well 

placed. As Zwaan and Radvansky (1998, p. 177) 

argued, ÒLanguage can be regarded as a set of 

processing instructions on how to construct a 

mental representation of the described situation.Ó 

In addition, the here-and-now view of situation-

model updating has received support.
What are the limitations of the event-in-
dexing model? First, it is not entirely correct 

to regard the various aspects of a situation 

as entirely separate. Consider the following 

sentence from Zwaan and Radvansky (p. 180): 

ÒSomeone was making noise in the backyard. 

Mike had left hours ago.Ó This sentence pro-

vides information about temporality but also 
of a situation (e.g., a change in the spatial setting; 

a ß ashback in time) requires more processing 

effort than when all Þ ve aspects or indexes 

remain the same. It is also assumed that the 

Þ
 ve aspects are monitored 
independently
 of 
each other. It follows that processing effort 

should be greater when two aspects change at

Zwaan and Madden (2004) distinguished 
between two views on updating situation models. 

One is the 
here-and-now view
, in which the 

most current information is more available 

than outdated information. The other is the 

resonance view
, according to which new infor-
mation in a text resonates with

the comprehension process. The here-and-now 

view forms part of the event-indexing model.
Evidence
Support for the prediction that reading a sentence 

involving discontinuity in one aspect takes longer  

than one with no discontinuity was reported 

by Rinck and Weber (2003). They considered 

shifts (versus continuity) in the protagonist, 

temporality, and spatiality. The reading time 

per syllable was 164 ms with no shifts and 220 

with one shift. This increased to 231 ms with 

two shifts and 248 ms with three shifts.
Support for the here-and-now view of 
updating was reported by Zwaan and Madden 

(2004). In one of their stories, all participants 

read the following target sentence: ÒBobby 

began pounding the boards together with the 

hammer.Ó In different conditions, the preceding 

sentences indicated that the hammer was always 

available (enablement condition), was never 

available because it was lost (disablement con-

dition), or had been unavailable because it was 

lost but had now been found (re-enablement 

condition). What was of most theoretical impor-

tance was the time taken to read the target 

sentence in the re-enablement condition. 

According to the here-and-now view, the time 

should be the same as in the enablement con-

dition because use of the hammer is consistent 

with the current situation. According to the

integration model. It is assumed that the 
only
 
meaningful representation that is formed is a 
perceptual simulation, which contrasts with 

the three representations assumed within the 

constructionÐintegration model.
Evidence
Support for the experiential-simulations approach 

was reported by Zwaan et al. (2002). Partici-

pants read sentences such as the following: 

ÒThe ranger saw an eagle in the skyÓ or ÒThe 

rang"
Segment_733,"er saw an eagle in the nestÓ. They were then   presented with a picture, and decided rapidly   whether the object in the picture had been   mentioned in the sentence.

They were then 

presented with a picture, and decided rapidly 

whether the object in the picture had been 

mentioned in the sentence. On ÒYesÓ trials, the 

picture was a match for the implied shape of 

the object (e.g., an eagle with outstretched wings 

after the Òin the skyÓ sentence) or was not a 

match (e.g., an eagle with folded wings after the  

Òin the skyÓ sentence). Participants responded 

signiÞ
 cantly faster when the objectÕs shape in 
the picture matched that implied by the sentence 

(see Figure 10.15). This suggests that people con-

struct a perceptual simulation of the situation 

described by sentences.
What happens when people are presented 
with negated sentences such as, ÒThere was no 

eagle in the skyÓ or ÒThere was no eagle in the 

nestÓ? Do they continue to create experiential 

simulations in the same way as when presented 

with sentences describing what is the case? 

Kaup et al. (2007) used the same paradigm as 
permits the causal inference that Mike was not 

the person making the noise.
Second, situation models are not always 
constructed. Zwaan and van Oostendorp (1993) 

found that most readers failed to construct 

a situation model when reading a complex 

account of the details of a murder scene. This 

probably happened because it was cognitively 

demanding to form a situation model Ð particip-

ants explicitly instructed to form such a model 

read the text very slowly.
Third, the event-indexing model claims 
that readers update their situation model to 

take account of new information. However, 

this generally did not happen when people 

read stories in which their original impression 

of an individualÕs personality was refuted by 

subsequent information (Rapp & Kendeou, 

2007).
Fourth, the event-indexing model has 
relatively little to say about the 
internal repre-

sentations
 of events that readers and listeners 

form when engaged in language comprehension. 

Progress in unders"
Segment_734,"tanding such internal repre-  sentations has emerged from the experiential-  simulations approach, which is discussed next.

As Zwaan (2008) argued, the two approaches 

are complementary: the focus of the event-

indexing model is at a fairly general level, 

whereas that of the experiential-simulations 

approach is at a more speciÞ
 c level.
Experiential-simulations approach
The experiential-simulations approach has been 

advocated by several theorists (e.g., Kaup, Yaxley, 


StanÞ
 eld, & Yaxley, 2002). Its crucial assump-
tion was expressed by Kaup et al. (2007, p. 978): 

ÒComprehension is tied to the creation of rep-

resentations that are similar in nature to the 

representations created when directly experi-

encing or re-experiencing the respective situations 

and events.Ó Thus, situation models contain many 

perceptual details that would be present if the 

described situation were actually perceived.
The experiential-simulations approach is 
more 
economical
 than the constructionÐ

sentence when its shape was appropriate in 

the context of the sentence (see Figure 10.16). 

The similarity in the Þ 

and Zwaan (2006) and Zwaan et al. (2002) 

suggests that the processing of negative sen-

tences involves very similar initial experiential 

simulations to those produced by corresponding 

afÞ rmative sentences.
If readers simply created the same ex-
peri
ential simulation whether the situation in 

question had actually occurred or had been 

negated, chaos and error would result! Kaup 

et al. (2006) found that readers presented with 

negative sentences initially simulate the negated 

situation but then rapidly create an experiential 

simulation of the correct meaning of the 

sentence. This second simulation is produced 

within about 1.5 seconds or so.
Evaluation
The notion that the comprehension process 

involves 
constructing a perceptual simulation 
of the situation described is an exciting one. 

However, what is needed is more systematic 

research to identify the circumstances in which 

the experiential-simulations approach is appli-

cable. For example, constructing perceptual 

simulations is likely to be cognitively demanding 

so that individuals often lack sufÞ
 cientprocess-
ing resources to construct them. In addition, 

the experiential-simulations approach has little 

to say about the processes involved in compre-

hending abstract material.
 Parsing
† 
Sentence processing involves parsing and the assignment of meaning. The garden-path 

model is a two-stage model in which the simplest syntactic structure is selected at the Þ
 rst 
stage using the principles of minimal attachment and late closure. In fact, semantic infor-

mation is often used earlier in sentence processing than proposed by the model. According

the same time. According to the unrestricted race model, all sources of information are 
used to identify a single syntactic structure for a sentence. If this structure is disconÞ
 rmed, 
there is extensive re-analysis. Studies using ERPs support the view that several sources of 

information (including word meanings and context) inß uence sentence processing at a 

very early stage. The common assumption that sentences are eventually interpreted 

correctly is often wrong Ð we actually use heuristics and are prone to error.
Pragmatics
†
The notion that the literal meaning of metaphors is accessed before the non-literal mean-
ing is incorrect. Non-literal meanings are often accessed as rapidly as literal ones. There

is support for the graded salience hypothesis, according to which salient messages (whether

literal or non-literal) are processed initially. According to the predication model, under
-
standing metaphors involves selecting features of the predicate that are relevant to the

argument and inhibiting irrelevant predicate features. Individuals high in working memory

capacity are better at such inhibition. Listeners generally try to use their knowledge of

the common ground when understanding what a speaker is saying. However, processing

limitations often prevent them from doing this fully, which sometimes makes it appear

that they are using the egocentric heuristic.
Individual differences: working memory capacity
†

There is evidence that individuals having high working memory capacity are better at  sentence comprehension than those with low capacity, in part because they have greater  attentional control and can suppress irrelevant information.

research has suggested that comprehension processes of high-capacity individuals are

characterised by greater efÞ 
ciency, adaptability, and synchronisation of brain activation
than are those of low-capacity individuals.
Discourse processing
†
We typically make logical and bridging inferences (e.g., anaphor resolution). According
to the constructionist approach, numerous elaborative inferences are typically drawn when

we read a text. According to the minimalist hypothesis, only a few inferences are drawn

automatically; additional strategic inferences depend on the readerÕs goals. The evidence

is generally more supportive of the minimalist hypothesis than the constructionist approach.

However, the minimalist hypothesis is too minimalist and readers sometimes make more

elaborative inferences than expected by the hypothesis.
Storyprocessing
†
According to schema theory
, schemas or organised packets of knowledge inß
 uence what
we remember of stories. Schema inß 
uence comprehension and retrieval processes. There
is some evidence of a double dissociation between schema knowledge and concept know-
ledge in brain-damaged patients. According to KintschÕs constructionÐintegration model,

three levels of representation of a text are constructed. Top-down processes occur earlier

in comprehension than assumed by the model. According to the event-indexing model,

readers monitor Þ ve aspects of the evolving situational model, with discontinuity in any

aspect creating difÞ culties in situation-model construction. According to the experiential-

simulations approach, we construct perceptual simulations during comprehension.

 nd writing much harder than speaking, which 
suggests that there are important differences 
between them. The main similarities and dif-

ferences between speaking and writing will 

now be considered.
Similarities
The view that speaking and writing are similar 

receives some support from theoretical approaches 

to speech production and writing. It is assumed 

there is an initial attempt to decide on the 

overall meaning to be communicated (e.g., Dell, 

Burger, & Svec, 1997, on speech production; 

Hayes & Flower, 1986, on writing). At this 

stage, the actual words to be spoken or written 

are not considered. This is followed by the 

production of language, which often proceeds 

on a clause-by-clause "

studied an individual (Eric Sotto) who dictated 

word-processed academic letters using a voice-

dictating word-processed letters than word 

processing them, but the letters he produced 

did not differ in readability or in typographical 

and grammatical errors. However, there were 

fewer long sentences when dictation was used, 

because Eric Sotto found it harder to change 

the structure of a sentence when dictating it.
Gould (1978) found that even those highly 
practised at dictation rarely dictated more than 

35% faster than they wrote. This is notable 
INTRODUCTION
We know more about language comprehension 

than language production. Why is this? We 

can control the material to be comprehended, 

but it is harder to constrain an individualÕs 

production of language. A further problem in 

accounting for language production (shared 

with language comprehension) is that more 

than a theory of language is needed. Language 

production is basically a goal-directed activity 

having communication as its main goal. People 

speak and write to impart information, to be 

friendly, and so on. Thus, motivational and 

social factors need to be considered in addition 

to purely linguistic ones.
The two major topics considered in this 
chapter are speech production and writing, 

including coverage of the effects of brain 

damage on these language processes. More is 

known about speech production than about 

writing. Nearly everyone spends more time 

talking than writing, and so it is of more practical 

value to understand the processes involved in 

talking. However, writing is an important skill 

in most societies.
There is much controversy concerning the 
extent to which the psychological processes 

involved in spoken and written language are 

the same or different. They are similar in that

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
Writers typically have direct access to 
(4) 
what they have produced so far, whereas 
speakers do not. However, Olive and
 
Piolat (2002) found no difference in the 

quality of the texts produced by writers 

having (or not having) access to visual 

feedback of what they had written.

ÒWriting is in essence a more conscious 
(5) 
process than speaking . . . spontaneous dis-

course is usually spoken, self-monitored 

discourse is usually writtenÓ (Halliday, 
1987, pp. 67Ð 
69).
What are the consequences of the above 
differences between speaking and writing? Spoken 
language is often informal and simple in struc-

ture, with information being communicated 

rapidly. In contrast, written language is more 

formal and has a more complex structure. 

Writers need to write clearly because they do 

not receive immediate feedback, and this slows 

down the communication rate.
Some brain-damaged patients have writing 
skills that are largely intact in spite of an almost 

total inability to speak and a lack of inner 

speech. For example, this pattern was observed 

in EB, who had suffered a stroke (Levine, 

Calvanio, & Popovics, 1982). Other patients can 

speak ß uently but Þ nd writing very difÞ
 cult. 
However, the higher-level processes involved 

in language production (e.g., planning; use of 

knowledge) may not differ between speaking 

and writing.
SPEECH AS 
COMMUNICATION
For most people (unless there is something 
seriously wrong with them), speech nearly always 

occurs as conversation in a social context. 

Grice (1967) argued that the key to successful 

communication is the Co-operative Principle, 

according to which speakers and listeners "
Segment_741,"must    try to be co-operative. In addition to the Co-operative Principle,  Grice proposed four maxims the speaker should   heed: given that people can speak Þve or six times   faster than they can write. Gould (1980) video-  taped people while they composed letters.   Planning took up two-thirds of",Explores how perception influences cognition.,"attention, perception, awareness",Nested under Chapter on emotion,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in perception,Aligned with contemporary studies on attention,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_412,"must  

try to be co-operative.
In addition to the Co-operative Principle, 
Grice proposed four maxims the speaker should 

heed:
given that people can speak Þve or six times 

faster than they can write. Gould (1980) video-

taped people while they composed letters. 

Planning took up two-thirds of the total com-

position time for both dictated and written 

letters, which explains why dictation was only 

slightly faster than writing.
More evidence suggesting that speech pro-
duction and writing involve similar processes 

comes from the study of patients with BrocaÕs 

aphasia (see later in the chapter), whose speech 

is grammatically incorrect and lacking ß
 uency. 
Most such patients have deÞ cits in sentence 

production whether speaking or writing (Benson 

& Ardila, 1996). However, Assal, Buttet, and 

Jolivet (1981) reported an exceptional case of 

a patient whose writing was very ungrammatical  

but whose speech was largely unaffected.
Differences
There are several differences between speaking 

and writing (see Cleland & Pickering, 2006, 

for a review). Written language uses longer and 

more complex constructions, as well as longer 

words and a larger vocabulary. Writers make 

more use than speakers of words or phrases 

signalling what is coming next (e.g., but; on 

the other hand). This helps to compensate for 

the lack of prosody (rhythm, intonation, and 

so on, discussed shortly) that is important in 

spoken language.
Five differences between speaking and writing 
are as follows:
Speakers know precisely who is receiving 
(1) 
their messages.

Speakers generally receive moment-by-
(2) 
moment feedback from the listener or 

listeners (e.g., expressions of bewilderment) 
and adapt what they say in response to 
verbal and non-verbal feedback from
 
listeners.

Speakers generally have much less time 
(3) 
than writers to plan their language pro-

duction, which helps to explain why 

spoken language is generally shorter and 

less complex.

Common ground
It is often assumed that speakers try hard 
toensure that their message is understood. 

According to Clark (e.g., Clark & Krych, 2004), 

speakers and listeners typically work together 

to maximise 
common ground
, i.e., mutual 

beliefs, expectations, and knowledge. In other 

words, speakers and listeners try to get Òon 

the same wavelengthÓ.
To what extent do speakers pay attention 
to the common ground? Horton and Keysar 

(1996) distinguished between two theoretical 

positions:
The initial design model
(1) 
: this is based on 
the principle of optimal design, in which 

the speakerÕs initial plan for an utterance 
takes full account of the common ground 

with the listener.
The monitoring and adjustment model
(2) 
: 
according to this model, speakers plan 

their utterances initially on the basis of 

information available to them 
without
 
considering the listenerÕs perspective. 
Maxim of quantity
†
: the speaker should be
as informative as necessary, but not more

so.

Maxim of quality
†
: the speaker should be
truthful.

Maxim of relation
†
: the speaker should say
things that are relevant to the situation.

Maxim of manner
†
: the speaker should make

What needs to be said (maxim of quantity)
depends on what the speaker wishes to describe 

(the referent). It is also necessary to know the 

object from which the referent must be distin-

guished. It is sufÞ
 
cient to say, ÒThe boy is good 
at footballÓ, if the other players are all men, 

but not if some of them are also boys. In the 

latter case, it is necessary to be more speciÞ

footballÓ).

Sacks, Schegloff, and Jefferson (1974) found 

that those involved in a conversation tend to 

follow certain rules. For example, when the 

speaker gazes at the listener, this is often an 

invitation to the listener to become the speaker. 

If the speaker wishes to continue speaking, 

he/she can indicate this by hand gestures or 

Þ
 lling pauses with meaningless sounds (e.g., 
ÒErrrrrrÓ).
Brennan (1990) argued that one common 
way in which a conversation moves from one 

speaker to another is via an 
adjacency pair
. 

What the Þ rst speaker says provides a strong 

invitation to the listener to take up the con-

versation. A question followed by an answer 

is a very common example of an adjacency 

pair. If the Þ rst speaker completes what he/she 

intended to say without producing the Þ
 rstpart 
of an adjacency pair, then the next turn goes 

to the listener.
Sacks et al. (1974) found that those involved in a 
conversation tend to follow certain rules. For 

example, if the speaker wishes to continue 

speaking, he/she can indicate this by using hand 

gestures.

 the mutual knowledge and 
beliefs shared by a speaker and listener.

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
Ferreira (2008, p. 209) argued along similar 
lines: ÒSpeakers seem to choose utterances that 
are especially easy for them to say, speciÞ
 cally 
by producing more accessible, easy-to-think-of 

material sooner, and less accessible, harder-to-

think-of material later.Ó He reviewed evidence 

indicating that speakers often produce ambigu-

ous sentences even though such sentences pose 

special difÞ culties for listeners. This approach 

often works well in practice, be"
Segment_744,cause listeners   are typically provided with enough information   to understand ambiguous sentences. The study by Horton and Keysar (1996)  was limited in that the listeners did not speak.   Common ground can be achieved much more   easily in a situation involving interaction and   dialogue (Clark,Explores how recognition influences cognition.,"awareness, attention, perception",Nested under Chapter on perception,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in attention,Aligned with contemporary studies on recognition,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_507,"cause listeners 

are typically provided with enough information 

to understand ambiguous sentences.
The study by Horton and Keysar (1996) 
was limited in that the listeners did not speak. 

Common ground can be achieved much more 

easily in a situation involving interaction and 

dialogue (Clark & Krych, 2004). There were 

pairs of participants, with one being a director 

who instructed the other member (the builder) 

how to construct Lego models. Errors in the 

constructed model were made on 39% of trials 

when no interaction was possible compared to 

only 5% when the participants could interact. 

In addition, directors often very rapidly altered 

what they said to maximise the common ground 

between them and the builders in the interactive 

condition. For example, when Ken (one of the 

builders) held a block over the right location 

while Jane (one of the directors) was speaking, 

she almost instantly took advantage by inter-

rupting herself to say, ÒYes, and put it on the 

right-hand half of the Ð yes Ð of the green 

rectangle.Ó
These plans are then monitored and cor-

rected to take account of the common 

ground.
Horton and Keysar asked participants to 
describe moving objects so the listener could 

identify them. These descriptions were pro-

duced rapidly (speeded condition) or slowly 

(unspeeded condition). There was a shared-

context condition in which the participants 

knew the listener could see the same additional 

objects they could see, and a non-shared-

context condition in which the participants 

knew the listener could 
not
 see the other 

objects. If the participants made use of the 

common ground, they should have utilised 

contextual information in their descriptions 

only in the shared-context condition.
Participants in the unspeeded condition 
used the common ground in their descriptions.

each other beforehand. It is more demanding 
to keep track of the other personÕs knowledge 

in such situations than when two long-term 

friends have a conversation. Another limitation 

in most studies is that the common ground 

relates to information presented in visual dis-

plays. In everyday life, the common ground 

often refers to past events, knowledge of 

mutual acquaintances, knowledge of the world, 

and so on, as well as information directly 

present.
Evaluation
Communication would be most effective if 

speakers took full account of listenersÕ know-

ledge and the common ground, but this is often 

too cognitively demanding to do. In practice, 

speakers make more use of the common ground 

when time is not limited, when interaction is 

possible between speakers and listeners, and 

when listeners state that they have a problem.
One limitation of most research in this 
area is that speakers and listeners do not know 
How do speakers deal with the common ground?
Bard, Anderson, Chen,"
Segment_746,"Nicholson, Havard, and   Dalzel-Job (2007) agreed with Horton and Keysar    (1996) that speakers typically fail to take full   account of the common ground.They identiÞ ed   two possible strategies speakers might take with   respect to the common ground: Shared responsibility: the speaker may expec",Explores how recognition influences cognition.,"emotion, memory, perception",Nested under Chapter on emotion,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in attention,Aligned with contemporary studies on emotion,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_153," Nicholson, Havard, and 

Dalzel-Job (2007) agreed with Horton and Keysar  

(1996) that speakers typically fail to take full 

account of the common ground.They identiÞ ed 

two possible strategies speakers might take with 

respect to the common ground:
Shared responsibility: the speaker may expect 
(1) 
the listener to volunteer information if he/

she perceives there to be a problem with 

the common ground.

Cognitive overload: the speaker may try to  
(2) 
keep track of his/her own knowledge as well 

as that of the listener, but generally Þ
 nds that 
this requires excessive cognitive processing.
Bard et al. (2007) asked speakers to describe 
the route on a map so another person could 

reproduce it. Unknown to the speaker, the other 

person was a confederate of the experimenter. 

Each speaker had two kinds of information 

indicating that the confederate was having dif-

Þ culties in reproducing the route: (1) the con-

federate said he/she had a problem; or (2) the 

confederateÕs fake eye movements were focused 

away from the correct route.
What would we expect to Þnd? According 
to the shared responsibility account, the speaker 

should pay more attention to what the confeder-

ate said than to his/her direction of gaze. Only the 

former involves the confederate volunteering 

information. According to the cognitive overload 
account, the speaker should focus more on the gaze 

feedback than on what the confederate said 

because it is easier to process gaze information. 

In fact, speakers took much more account of what 

the confederate said than his/her gaze pattern 

(see Figure 11.2).
The take-home message is that speakers 
generally focus mainly on their own knowledge 

rather than their listenerÕs. Presumably they do 

this to make life easier for themselves. However, 

speakers do attend to the listenerÕs lack of know-

ledge when he/she says something is amiss.

done in various ways. For example, the speaker 
can repeat what the previous speaker said with 

a rising intonation or with an additional question 

(Pickering & Garrod, 2004). The approach here 

is consistent with the notion of shared respon-

sibility emphasised by Bard et al. (2007).
PLANNING OF SPEECH
The Þ rst stage in speech production generally 

involves deciding what message you want to 

communicate. Most of the time, you plan some 

of what you are going to say before speaking. 

However, there has been much controversy 

concerning the 
amount
 of forward planning 

that occurs. Several theorists (e.g., Garrett, 

1980) have argued that the planning of speech 

may extend over an entire 
clause
, a part of a 

sentence containing a subject and a verb. There 

is support for this view from the study of 

speech errors (see Garrett, 1980). For example, 

word-exchange errors (discussed later) involve 

two words changing places. Of importance, 

the words exchanged often come from different 

phrases but the same clause (e.g., ÒMy chair 

seems empty without my roomÓ).
Additional evidence that planning may be 
at the clause level was reported by Holmes 

(1988). Speakers talked spontaneously about 

various topics, and then other participants read 

the utterances produced. Speakers (but not 

readers) often had hesitations and pauses before 

the start of a clause, 
suggesting they were plan-
ning the forthcoming clause.
Other evidence suggests that speech planning 
may be at t"

Interactive alignment model
Pickering and Garrod (2004) accepted in their 

interactive alignment model that speakers and 

listeners often lack the processing resources 

to maximise the common ground. As a conse-

quence, two people involved in a conversation 

often do not 
deliberately
 try to infer the other 

personÕs representation of the current situation. 

However, these situation representations often 

overlap substantially as a result of various fairly 

automatic processes. Thus, speakers and listeners 

can frequently achieve common ground in a 

relatively effortless way. For example, speakers 

often copy phrases and even sentences they heard 

when the other person was speaking. Thus, the 

other personÕs words serve as a prime or prompt. 

In addition, speakers often make extensive use of  

the ideas communicated by the other person.
One of the ways in which speakers and 
listeners get on the same wavelength is via 

syntactic priming. 
Syntactic priming
 occurs when 
a previously experienced syntactic structure 

inß
 uences current processing. Here is a con-
crete example. If you have just heard a passive 

sentence (e.g., ÒThe man was bitten by the 

dogÓ), this increases the chance that you will 

produce a passive sentence yourself. This occurs 

even when you are not consciously aware 

of copying a previous syntactic structure (see 

Pickering & Ferreira, 2008, for a review).
Evidence of syntactic priming was reported 
by Cleland and Pickering (2003). A confederate 

of the experimenter described a picture to 

participants using an adjectiveÐnoun order 

(e.g., Òthe red sheepÓ) or a nounÐrelative-clause 

order (e.g., Òthe sheep thatÕs redÓ). Participants 

tended to use the syntactic structure they had 

heard even when the words in the two sentences 

were very different. However, there was stronger 

syntactic priming when the noun remained the 

same (e.g., sheepÐsheep) than when it did not 

(e.g"
Segment_749,"., sheepÐknife). Syntactic priming makes it   easier for those involved in a conversation to   co-ordinate information. What happens when syntactic priming and  other processes fail to achieve common ground?    According to the model, speakers expect the   other person to sort the problem out. This",Explores how recognition influences cognition.,"perception, recognition, emotion",Nested under Chapter on awareness,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in perception,Aligned with contemporary studies on awareness,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_606,"., sheepÐknife).

that participants fully planned their responses 
before speaking. However, the Þ
 ndings differed 
in a second experiment in which participants 

had to start producing their answers to math-

ematical problems very rapidly for them to be 

counted. In these circumstances, some planning 

occurred before speaking, with additional plan-

ning occurring during speaking. Thus, speakers 

did only as much prior planning as was feasible 

in the time available before starting to speak.
Spieler and GrifÞ n (2006) also found 
evidence of ß exibility in a study on individual 

differences. Speakers who spoke the fastest 

tended to be the ones whose speech was least 

ß
 uent. The implication is that fast speakers 
engaged in less planning of speech than slow 

speakers, and this relative lack of planning time 

impaired the ß uency of what they said.
Evaluation
Progress has been made in discovering the factors 

determining the amount of forward planning 

in which speakers engage. In general, studies 

in which speakers are free from constraints as 

to 
what
 to say and 
when
 to say it (e.g., Garrett,  
1980; Holmes, 1988) indicate that speech plan-

ning is fairly extensive and probably includes 

entire phrases "
Segment_750,"or clauses. However, when the   task is more artiÞ cial and the same sentence frame   is used repeatedly (e.g., GrifÞ  n, 2001; Martin,  Miller, & Vu, 2004), planning is more limited.   Not surprisingly, there is less forward planning   when speakers are under time pressure (e.g.,   Ferreira & Swets",Explores how attention influences cognition.,"memory, perception, awareness",Nested under Chapter on recognition,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in awareness,Aligned with contemporary studies on recognition,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_749,"or clauses. However, when the 

task is more artiÞ cial and the same sentence frame 

is used repeatedly (e.g., GrifÞ
 n, 2001; Martin, 
Miller, & Vu, 2004), planning is more limited. 

Not surprisingly, there is less forward planning 

when speakers are under time pressure (e.g., 

Ferreira & Swets, 2002). Finally, there are sub-

stantial individual differences among speakers 

(e.g., Spieler & GrifÞ n, 2006) Ð some people 

seem 
unable to follow the advice to Òkeep your 
mouth 
closed until your mind is in gearÓ.
What are the limitations of research in 
this area? First, many studies have used very 

artiÞ
 cial tasks, and so Þ ndings are unlikely to 
generalise to more naturalistic situations. Second, 

the main dependent variable is typically the 

time to speech onset or the length of the pause 

between successive utterances. It is hard to 

know what speakers are doing during such 

time intervals or to assess the precise extent of 

their forward planning.
words expressing a single idea and smaller in 

scope than a clause. Martin, Miller, and Vu (2004)  

asked participants to describe moving pictures. 

The sentences had a simple initial phrase (e.g., 

ÒThe ball moves above the tree and the Þ
 ngerÓ) 
or a complex initial phrase (e.g., ÒThe ball and 

the tree move above the Þ ngerÓ). Speakers took 

longer to initiate speech when using complex 

initial phrases, suggesting they were planning 

the initial phrase before starting to speak.
In contrast, GrifÞ n (2001) argued that speech 
planning is extremely limited. Participants were  

presented with displays containing three pictured 

objects and responded according to the following 

sentence frame: ÒThe A and the B are above 

the C.Ó The time taken to start speaking was

point was reported by Ferreira and Swets (2002). 

Participants answered mathematical problems 

varying in difÞ culty level, and the time taken 

to start speaking and the length of time spent 

speaking were recorded. If there were complete 

planning before speaking, the time taken to start  

speaking should have been longer for more 

difÞ
 cult problems than for easier ones, but the 
time spent speaking would not vary. In con-

trast, if people started speaking before planning 

their responses, then the time taken to start 

speaking should be the same for all problems. 

However, the duration of speaking should be 

longer with more difÞ

ÒohÓ and ÒwellÓ were used more often in casual

These differences may occur because speakers 

need to respond more to what the other person 

has said in conversations than in interviews.

BASIC ASPECTS OF 
SPOKEN LANGUAGE
On the face of it (by the sound of it?), speech 
production is straightforward. It seems almost 

effortless as we chat with friends or acquain-

tances. We typically speak at 2Ð3 words a 

second or about 150 words a minute, and this 

rapid speech rate Þ ts the notion that speaking 

is very undemanding of processing resources.
The reality of speech production is often 
very different from the above account. We use 

various strategies when talking to reduce pro-

cessing demands while we plan what to say next 

(see Smith, 2000, for a review). One example 

is 
preformulation
, which involves reducing pro-
cessing costs by producing phrases used before. 

About 70% of our speech consists of 
word 

combinations we use repeatedly 
(Altenberg, 
1990). 
Kuiper (1996) analysed the speech of two groups 

of people (auctioneers and sports commentators) 

who often need to speak very rapidly. Speaking 

quickly led them to make very extensive use 

of preformulations (e.g., ÒThey are on their 

wayÓ; ÒThey are off and racing nowÓ).
Another strategy we use to make speech 
production easier is 
underspeci˚ cation
, which 

involves using simpliÞ ed expressions in which 

"
Segment_753,"the full meaning is not expressed explicitly.   Smith (2000) illustrated underspeciÞ  cation with  the following: ÒWash and core six cooking apples.

the following: ÒWash and core six cooking apples.

Discourse markers
There are important differences between 

spontaneous conversational speech and pre-

pared speech (e.g., a public talk). As Fox Tree 

(2000) pointed out, several words and phrases 

(e.g., well; you know; oh; but anyway) are far 

more common in spontaneous speech. These 

discourse markers
 do not contribute directly 

to the content of utterances but are nevertheless  

of value. Flowerdew and Tauroza (1995) found 

that participants understood a videotaped 
preformulation:
 this is used in speech 
production to reduce processing costs by saying 

phrases often used previously.

As you may have noticed, speakers often gesture 

during telephone conversations, even though 

these gestures are not visible to the listener.
Bavelas, Gerwing, Sutton, and Prevost (2008) 
found that speakers make any gestures while 

talking to someone face-to-face than over the 

telephone, which suggests that gestures 
are
 often 
used for communication purposes. Why do 

speakers make any gestures when on the tele-

speakers use prosodic cues varies considerably 

from study to study. Speakers are less likely 

to use prosodic cues if they simply read aloud 

ambiguous sentences rather than communi-

cating spontaneously. For example, Keysar and 

Henly (2002) asked participants to read am-

biguous sentences to convey a speciÞ
 c meaning, 
with listeners deciding which of two meanings 

was intended. The speakers did not use prosodic 

cues (or used them ineffectively), because the 

listeners only guessed correctly 61% of the time. 

Speakers failed to make their meaning clearer 

because they overestimated how much of the time 

listeners understood the intended meaning.
Snedeker and Trueswell (2003) argued that 
prosodic cues are much more likely to be 

provided when the context fails to clarify the 

meaning of an ambiguous sentence. Speakers 

said ambiguous sentences (e.g., ÒTap the frog 

with the ß owerÓ: you either use the ß
 ower to 
tap the frog or you tap the frog that has the 

ß
 ower). They provided many more prosodic 
cues when the context was consistent with both 

interpretations of the sentence.
Suppose we discover in some situation that 
speakers generally provide prosodic cues that 

resolve syntactic ambiguities. Does that neces-

sarily mean that speakers are responsive to the 

needs of their listener(s)? According to Kraljic 

and Brennan (2005), it does not. Speakers pro-

ducing spontaneous sentences made extensive 

use of prosodic cues, and listeners successfully 

used these cues to disambiguate what they heard.

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
Types of error
There are several types of speech error other 
than those mentioned already. One type of 

error is the 
spoonerism
, which occurs when 
the initial letter or letters of two words are 
switched. It is named after the Reverend 

William Archibald Spooner, who is credited 

with several memorable examples (e.g., ÒYou 

have hissed all my mystery lecturesÓ). Alas, 

most of the Reverend SpoonerÕs gems were the 

result of much painstaking effort.
One of the most famous kinds of speech 
error is the 
Freudian slip
, which reveals the 

speakerÕs true desires. Motley (1980) studied 

Freudian slips by trying to produce sex-related 

spoonerisms. Male participants said out loud 

pairs of items such as 
goxi furl
 and 
bine foddy
. 

The experimenter was a male or a female Òwho 

was by design attractive, personable, very pro-

vocatively attired, and seductive in behaviourÓ 

(p. 140). Motley predicted (and found) that 

the number of spoonerisms (e.g., 
goxi furl
 
turning into 
foxy girl
) was greater when the 

passions of the male participants were inß
 amed 
by the female experimenter. In other experiments 

(see Motley, B"
Segment_756,"aars, & Camden, 1983), male   participants were given word pairs such as  tool  kits  and  fast luck . There were more sexual   spoonerisms (e.g.,  cool tits ) when the situation   produced sexual arousal.

participants were given word pairs such as 
tool 
kits
 and 
fast luck
. There were more sexual 

spoonerisms (e.g., 
cool tits
) when the situation 

produced sexual arousal.
Semantic substitution
 errors occur when 
the correct word is replaced by a word of 

similar meaning (e.g., ÒWhere is my tennis batÓ 

instead of ÒWhere is my tennis racquet?Ó). In 

99% of cases, the substituted word is of the 

same form class as the correct word (e.g., 

nouns substitute for nouns). Verbs are much 

less likely than nouns, adjectives, or adverbs 
SPEECH ERRORS
Our speech is imperfect and prone to various 

kinds of error. Many psychologists have argued 

that we can learn much about the processes 

involved in speech production by studying 

the types of error made and their relative fre-

quencies. There are various reasons why the 

study of speech errors is important. First, we 

can gain insights into how the complex cogni-

tive system involved in speech production 

works by focusing on what happens when it 

malfunctions.
Second, speech errors can shed light on 
the extent to which speakers plan ahead. For 

example, there are 
word-exchange errors 
in 

which two words in a sentence switch places 

(e.g., ÒI must let the house out of the catÓ 

instead of ÒI must let the cat out of the houseÓ). 

The existence of word-exchange errors suggests 

that speakers engage in forward planning of 

their utterances.
Third, comparisons between different 
speech errors can be revealing. For example, 

we can compare word-exchange errors with 

sound-exchange errors
 in which two sounds 

exchange places (e.g., Òbarn doorÓ instead of 

Òdarn boreÓ). Of key importance, the two 

words involved in word-exchange errors are 

typically further apart in the sentence than 

the two words involved in sound-exchange 

errors. This suggests that planning of the 

words to be used occurs at an earlier stage 

than planning of the sounds to be spoken.

way are very similar to those obtained from 

analysing tape-recorded conversations (Garnham, 

Oakhill, & Johnson-Laird, 1982). In recent 

years, there has been an increase in laboratory 

studies designed to produce certain kinds of 

speech error.

used a plural verb with such sentences because 
family is a collective noun. This tendency was 

greater when the noun closest to the verb was 

more obviously plural (e.g., 
rats
 ends in Ðs, 

which is a strong predictor of a plural noun).
McDonald (2008) asked participants to 
decide whether various sentences were gram-

matically correct. This was done with or with-

out an externally imposed load on working 

memory. Participants with this load found it 

especially difÞ cult to make accurate decisions 

concerning subjectÐverb agreement. This sug-

gests that we need to use considerable processing 

resources to avoid number-agreement errors.
THEORIES OF SPEECH 
PRODUCTION
Theorists agree that speech production involves 
various general processes, but there are dis-

agreements concerning the nature of these 

processes and how they interact. In this section, 

we will discuss two of the most inß
 uential 
theories of speech production. First, there is 

spreading-activation theory (Dell, 1986). Accord-

ing to this theory, the processes involved"
Segment_758,"in   speech production occur in parallel (at the same   time) and very different kinds of information   can be processed together. These assumptions   suggest that the processes involved in speech   production are very ß exible or even somewhat   chaotic. Second, there is the WEAVER + +  model   (L",Explores how attention influences cognition.,"attention, awareness, emotion",Nested under Chapter on attention,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in awareness,Aligned with contemporary studies on awareness,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_318," in 

speech production occur in parallel (at the same 

time) and very different kinds of information 

can be processed together. These assumptions 

suggest that the processes involved in speech 

production are very ß exible or even somewhat 

chaotic. Second, there is the WEAVER
+ +
 model  
(Levelt, Roelofs, & Meyer, 1999). According 

to this model, processing is serial and proceeds 

in an orderly fashion. These assumptions imply 

that the processes involved in speech production 

are highly regimented and structured. As we 

will see, both theoretical approaches have much 

to recommend them and some compromise 

between them is probably appropriate.
Spreading-activation theory
Dell (1986) argued in his spreading-activation 

theory that speech production consists of four 

levels:
to undergo semantic substitution (Hotopf, 

1980).
Morpheme-exchange errors
 involve inß
 ections  
or sufÞ xes remaining in place but attached to 

the wrong words (e.g., ÒHe has already trunk-

ed two packsÓ). An implication of morpheme-

exchange errors is that the positioning of inß
 ections 
is dealt with by a rather separate process from 

the one responsible for positioning word stems 

(e.g., ÒtrunkÓ; ÒpackÓ). The word stems (e.g., 

trunk; pack) seem to be worked out 
before
 the 

inß
 ections are added. This is the case because 
the spoken inß
 ections or sufÞ xes are generally 
altered to Þ t with the new word stems to which  

they are linked. For example, the ÒsÓ sound in 

the phrase Òthe forks of a prongÓ is pronounced 

in a way appropriate within the word ÒforksÓ. 

However, this is different to the ÒsÓ sound in 

the original word ÒprongsÓ (Smyth, Morris, 

Levy, & Ellis, 1987).
Finally, we consider 
number-agreement 
errors
, in which singular verbs are mistakenly 

used with plural subjects or vice versa. We are 

prone to making such errors in various circum-

stances. For example, we have problems with 

collective nouns (e.g., government; team) that 

are"
Segment_759,"actually singular but have characteristics   of plural nouns. We should say, ÒThe govern-  ment has made a mess of thingsÓ but some-  times say, ÒThe government have made a mess   of thingsÓ. We also make errors when we make   a verb agree with a noun close to it rather than   with the subject of t",Explores how emotion influences cognition.,"perception, attention, memory",Nested under Chapter on memory,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in attention,Aligned with contemporary studies on recognition,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_236," actually singular but have characteristics 

of plural nouns. We should say, ÒThe govern-

ment has made a mess of thingsÓ but some-

times say, ÒThe government have made a mess 

of thingsÓ. We also make errors when we make 

a verb agree with a noun close to it rather than 

with the subject of the sentence. For example, 

we complete the sentence fragment, ÒThe player  

on the courtsÓ with Ò
were
 very goodÓ. Bock 

and Eberhard (1993) found frequent number-

agreement errors with such sentences, but prac-

tically none at all when participants completed 

word fragments such as, ÒThe player on the 

court . . .Ó.
Why
 do we make number-agreement errors? 
According to Haskell and MacDonald (2003), 

we use several sources of information. For 

example, consider the two sentence fragments, 

ÒThe family of mice . . .Ó and ÒThe family of 

rats . . .Ó. Strictly speaking, the verb should be 

singular in both cases. However, many participants

 select the items for inclusion 
in the representation of the to-be-spoken

example, if the categorical rules at the syn-

tactic level dictate that a verb is required at a

is sometimes more activated than the correct 

one. The existence of spreading activation 

means that numerous nodes are

at the same time, which increases the likelihood  

of errors being made in speech.
Evidence
What kinds of error are predicted by the theory? 

First, and of particular importance, there 

is the 
mixed-error effect
, which occurs when 

an incorrect word is both semantically and 

phonemically related to the correct word. Dell 
Semantic level
† 
: the meaning of what is to be  
said or the message to be communicated.

Syntactic level
† 
: the grammatical structure 
of the words in the planned utterance.

Morphological level
† 
: the 
morphemes
 (basic 
units of meaning or word forms) in the 

planned sentence.

Phonological level
† 
: the phonemes (basic 
units of sound).
As mentioned already
, it is assumed within 
DellÕ
s spreading-activation theory that process-
ing occurs in parallel (at the same time) at all 

levels (e.g., semantic; syntactic). In addition, 

processing is 
interactive
, meaning that pro-

cesses at any level can inß uence those at any 

other level. In practice, however, Dell (1986) 

accepted that processing is generally more 

advanced at some levels (e.g., semantic) than 

others (e.g., phonological).
Unsurprisingly, the notion of 
spreading 
activation
 is central to DellÕs (1986) spreading-

activation model. It is assumed that the nodes 

within a network (many corresponding to 

words) vary in their activation or energy. When 

a node or word is activated, activation or 

energy spreads from it to other related nodes. 

For example, strong activation of the node 

corresponding to ÒtreeÓ may cause some activa-

tion of the node corresponding to ÒplantÓ. 

According to the theory, spreading activation 

can occur for sounds as well as for words

is a

 (dictionary) in the form of a con-

nectionist network. It contains nodes for 

concepts, words, morphemes, and phonemes.

all the nodes connected to it (see Chapter 1).

the skyÓ). This happens because all the words 
in the sentence tend to become activated during 

speech planning.
Fourth, anticipation errors should often 
turn into exchange errors, in which two words 

within a sentence are swapped (e.g., ÒI must 

write a wife to my letterÓ). Remember that the 

activation level of a selected item immediately 

reduces to zero. Therefore, if ÒwifeÓ has been 

selected too early, it is unlikely to be selected 

in its correct place in the sentence. This allows 

a previously unselected and highly activated 

item such as ÒletterÓ to appear in the wrong 

place. Many speech errors are of the exchange 

variety.
Fifth, anticipation and exchange errors 
generally involve words moving only a rela-

tively short distance within the sentence. Those

current consideration will tend to be more 

activated than those relevant to more distant 

parts of the sentence. Thus, the Þ
 ndings are in 
line with the predictions of spreading-activation 

theory.
Sixth, speech errors should tend to consist 
of actual words rather than nonwords (the 

lexical bias effect
). The reason is that it is easier 

for words than nonwords to become activated 

because they have representations in the lexicon. 

This effect was shown by Baars, Motley, and 

MacKay (1975). Word pairs were presented 

brieß
 y, and participants had to say both words 
rapidly. The error rate was twice as great when 

the word pair could be re-formed to create two  

new words (e.g., Òlewd ripÓ can be turned into 

Òrude lipÓ) than when it could not (e.g., ÒLuke 

riskÓ turns into Òruke liskÓ). The explanation 

of the lexical bias effect is more complicated 

than is assumed within the spreading-activation 
(1986) quoted the example of someone saying, 

ÒLetÕs stopÓ, instead of, ÒLetÕs startÓ, where 

the word ÒstopÓ is both semantically and pho-

nemically related to the correct word (i.e., 

ÒstartÓ). The existence of this effect suggests 

that the various levels of processing
 interact
 

ß
 exibly with each other. More speciÞ
 cally, the 
mixed-error effect suggests that semantic and 

phonological factors can both inß
 uence word 
selection at the same time.
It is hard with the mixed-error effect to 
work out how many incorrect words would 

be phonemically related to the correct word 

by chance. Stronger evidence was provided 

by Ferreira and GrifÞn (2003). In their key 

condition, participants were presented with an 

incomplete sentence such as, ÒI thought that 

there would still be some cookies left, but there 

were . . .Ó followed by picture naming (e.g., of 

a priest). Participants tended to produce the

Second, errors should belong to the appro-

the categorical rules and the syntactic trafÞ

do
 belong to 

the appropriate category (e.g., nouns replacing 

nouns; Dell, 1986). We might predict that some 

patients would suffer damage to the syntactic 

trafÞ
 c cop and so make numerous syntactic 
errors. Precisely that was found by Berndt, 

Mitchum, Haendiges, and Sandson (1997) in 

a study on patients with 
aphasia
 (impaired 

language abilities due to brain damage). The 

patients were given the task of naming pictures 

and videos of objects (noun targets) and actions 

(verb targets). The errors made by some of the 

patients nearly always involved words belong-

ing to the correct syntactic category, whereas 

those made by other patients were almost 

randomly distributed across nouns and verbs. 

It seems reasonable to argue that the latter 

patients had an impaired syntactic trafÞ
 c cop.
Third, many errors should be anticipation 
errors, in which a word is spoken earlier in the 

sentence than appropriate (e.g., ÒThe sky is in 
aphasia:
 impaired language abilities as a result 
of brain damage.

lexical bias effect:
 the tendency for speech 

errors to consist of words rather than 

nonwords.

: sounds or words are spoken
 
later than they should be (e.g., Òbeef 

needleÓ instead of Òbeef noodleÓ). These 

errors reß ect failure to monitor what one 
is about to say or planning failure.
Dell et al.Õ
s key assumption was that expert 
speakers plan ahead more than non-expert 

speakers, and so a higher proportion of their 

speech errors will be anticipatory. In their own 

words, ÒPractice enhances the activation of the 

present and future at the expense of the past. So,  

as performance gets better, perseverations become 

relatively less common.Ó The activation levels 

of sounds and words that have already been 

spoken are little affected by practice. However, 

the increasing activation levels of present and 

future sounds and words with practice prevent 

the past from intruding into present speech.
Dell et al. (1997) assessed the effects of 
practice on the anticipatory proportion (the 

proportion of total errors [anticipation 
+
 per-

severation] that is anticipatory). In one study, 

participants were given extensive practice at

found that the effect depends in part o n  a 

self-monitoring system that inhibits

speech errors.
According to spreading-activation theory, 
speech errors occur when the wrong word is 

more highly activated than the correct one, and 

so is selected. Thus, there should be numerous 

errors when incorrect words are readily available.

Evaluation
Spreading-activation theory has various strengths. 

First, the mixed-error effect indicates that the 

processing associated with speech production 

can be highly interactive, as predicted theoret-

ically. Second, several other types of speech error 

can readily be explained by the theory. Third, 

the theoryÕs emphasis on spreading activation 

provides links between speech production and 

other cognitive activities (e.g., word recognition; 

McClelland & Rumelhart, 1981). Fourth, our 

ability to produce novel sentences may owe much 

to the widespread activation between processing 

levels assumed within the theory.
What are the limitations of the theory? 
First, it has little to say about the processes 

operating at the semantic level. In other words, 

it de-emphasises issues relating to the construc-

tion of a message and its intended meaning. 

Second, while the theory predicts many of the 

speech errors that occur in speech production, 

it is not designed to predict the 
time
 taken 

to produce spoken words. Third, the theory 

focuses very much on the types of error made 

in speech. However, the interactive processes 

emphasised by the theory are more apparent 

in speech-error data than in error-free data 

(Goldrick, 2006). Fourth, an interactive system 

such as proposed within spreading-activation 

theory seems likely to produce many more 

errors than are actually observed in speech.

There are three main levels within the
†
network:
At the highest level are nodes representing
Ð
lexical concepts.

At the second level are nodes each
Ð
re
presenting a 
lemma
 from the mental
lexicon. Lemmas are representations of

words that Òare speciÞ
 ed syntactically
and semantically but not phonologicallyÓ

(Harley, 2008, p. 412). Thus, if you

know the meaning of a word you are

about to say and that it is a noun but

you do not know its pronunciation, you

have accessed its lemma.

At the lowest level are nodes representing
Ð
word forms in terms of morphemes

(basic units of meaning) and their pho-

nemic segments.
Dell et al. (1997) argued that speech errors 
are most likely when the speaker has not formed 
a coherent speech plan. In such circumstances, 

there will be relatively few anticipatory errors, 

and so the anticipatory proportion will be low. 

Thus, the overall error rate (anticipatory 
+
 
perseverative) should correlate 
negatively
 with 

the anticipatory proportion. Dell et al. worked 

out the overall error rate and the anticipatory 

proportion for several sets of published data. 

The anticipatory proportion decreased from 

about 0.75 with low overall error rates to 

about 0.40 with high overall error rates (see 

Figure 11.3).
Vousden and Maylor (2006) tested the 
theory by assessing speech errors in eight-

year-olds, 11-year-olds, and young adults 

who said tongue twisters aloud at a slow or 

fast rate. There were main Þ ndings. First, the 

anticipatory proportion increased as a function 

of age. This is predicted by the theory, because 

older children and young adults have had 

more practice at producing language. Second, 

fast speech produced a higher error rate than 

slow speech and also resulted in a lower antici-

patory proportion. This is in agreement wi"

What happens is known as 
lexicalisation
, 
which is Òthe process in speech production 

whereby we turn the thoughts underlying 

words into sounds. We translate a semantic 

representation (the meaning of a content word) 

into its phonological representation or form 

(its sound)Ó (Harley, 2008, p. 412).
In sum, WEAVER
++
 is a discrete, feed-
forward model. It is discrete, because the 

speed-production system completes its task of 

identifying the correct lemma or abstract word 

before starting to work out the sound of the 

selected word. It is feed-forward, because 
Speech production involves various pro-
†
cessing stages following each other in 
serial
fashion (one at a time).

Speech errors are avoided by means of a
†
checking mechanism.
It is easy to get lost in the complexities of
this model. However, it is mainly designed to 

show how word production proceeds from 
meaning (lexical concepts and lemmas) to
 
sound (e.g., phonological words). There is a 

stage of lexical selection, at which a lemma 

(representing word meaning

 syntax) is 
selected. A given lemma is generally selected

Levelt et al. (1999) assumed that the lemma

mation (syntactic information indicates whether 

the word is a noun, a verb, adjective, and so on).  

Accordingly, individuals in the tip-of-the-tongue 

state should have access to syntactic infor-

mation. In many languages (e.g., Italian and 

German), part 
of the syntactic information 
about nouns is in the form of grammatical 

gender (e.g., masculine, feminine). Vigliocco, 

Antonini, and Garrett (1997) carried out a 

study on Italian participants who guessed the

and Coltheart (2008), in a study in which 

German speakers guessed the grammatical 

gender and initial phoneme of nouns when in 

a tip-of-the-
tongue state. Theoretically, access to 

grammatical g en d er 
information precedes access 

to phonological information. As a result, 

participants should have been more successful 

at guessing the Þ rst phoneme when they had 

access to accurate gender information. That 

was
 not
 the case, thus casting doubt on the 

notion that 
syntactic information is available  

before phono
logical information.
The theoretical assumption that speakers 
have access to semantic and syntactic infor-

mation about words 
before
 they have access 

to phonological information has been tested 

in studies using event-related potentials (ERPs; 

see Glossary). For example, van Turennout, 

Hagoort, and Brown (1998) measured ERPs 

while their Dutch participants produced noun 

phrases (e.g., Òrode tafelÓ meaning Òred tableÓ). 
processing proceeds in a strictly forward (from 

meaning to sound) direction.
Evidence
We can see the distinction between a lemma 

and the word itself in the Òtip-of-the-tongueÓ 

state. We have all had the experience of having 

a concept or idea in mind while searching in 

vain for the right word to describe it. This 

frustrating situation deÞ nes the tip-of-the-tongue 

state. As Harley (2008) pointed out, it makes 

much sense to argue that the tip-of-the-tongue 

state occurs when semantic processing is suc-

cessful (i.e., we activate the correct lemma or 

abstract word) but phonological processing is 

unsuccessful (i.e., we cannot produce the sound 

of the word).
The most obvious explanation for the tip-
of-the-tongue state is that it occurs when the 

links between the semantic and phonological 

systems are relatively weak. Evidence con-

sistent with that view was reported by Harley 

and "
Segment_770,"Bown (1998). Words sounding unlike nearly   all other words (e.g., apron; vineyard) were   much more susceptible to the tip-of-the-tongue   state than words sounding like several other   words (e.g., litter; pawn).

much more susceptible to the tip-of-the-tongue

logical forms of words susceptible to the 

tip-of-the-tongue state make them hard to 

retrieve.
The tip-of-the-tongue state is an extreme form 
of pause, where the word takes a noticeable 

time to come out Ð although the speaker has a 

distinct feeling that they know exactly what they 

want to say. © image100/Corbis.

presented distractor pictures. The names of 
the objects in the pictures were phonologically 

related (e.g., dogÐdoll; ballÐwall) or unrelated. 

According to Levelt et al.Õs model, the phono-

logical features of the names for distractor 

pictures should not have been activated. Thus, 

speed of naming target pictures should not 

have been inß
 uenced by whether the names of 
the two pictures were phonologically related. 

In fact, the naming of target pictures was faster 

when accompanied by phonologically related 

distractors. These Þ ndings are consistent with 

spreading-activation theory.
More problems for WEAVER
++
 come from 
a study on bilinguals by Costa, Caramazza, 

and Sebastian-Galles (2000). Bilinguals who 

spoke Catalan and Spanish named pictures in 

Spanish. The main focus was on words that 

look and sound similar in both languages (e.g., 

ÒcatÓ is ÒgatÓ in Catalan and ÒgatoÓ in Spanish). 

According to WEAVER
++
, bilinguals should 

only access 
one
 lemma or abstract word at a 

time, and so it should be irrelevant that the 

Catalan word is very similar to the Spanish 

one. In fact, however, the naming times for 
Syntactic information about the nounÕs gender 

was available 40 ms before its initial phoneme.
Indefrey and Levelt (2004) "

Lexical selection occurs within about 175 ms 

of picture presentation, with the appropriate 

phonological (sound) code being retrieved 

between 250 and 300 ms of stimulus presenta-

tion. After that, a phonological word is generated 

at about 455 ms. Finally, after a further 145 ms  

or so, the sensori-motor areas involved in word  

articulation become active (see Figure 11.5). 

These timings are all consistent with predic-

tions from WEAVER

.
According to WEAVER
++
, abstract word 
or lemma selection is completed before phono-

logical information about the word is accessed. 

In contrast, it is assumed within DellÕs spreading-

to what typically happens. That conclusion 
emerges from Indefrey and LeveltÕs (2004) 

meta-analysis of studies on the timing of dif-

Segment_772,"ferent processes in word production. Second,   the development of LeveltÕs theoretical approach   had the advantage of shifting the balance of   research away from speech errors and towards   precise timing of word-production processes   under laboratory conditions.

Second, 

the development of LeveltÕs theoretical approach 

had the advantage of shifting the balance of 

research away from speech errors and towards 

precise timing of word-production processes 

under laboratory conditions. As Levelt, Schriefers, 

Vorberg, Meyer, Pechman, and Havinga (1991, 

p.615) pointed out, ÒAn exclusively error-based

approach to . . . speech production is as ill-

conceived as an exclusively illusion-based 

approach in vision research.Ó Third, WEAVER
++
 
is a simple and elegant model making many 

testable predictions. It is probably easier to test  

WEAVER
++
 than more interactive theories 

such as DellÕs spreading-activation theory.
What are the limitations of WEAVER
++
? 
First, it has a rather narrow focus, with the 

emphasis being on the production of single 

words. As a result, several of the processes 

involved in planning and producing entire 

sentences are not considered in detail.
Second, extensive laboratory evidence 
indicates that there is much more interaction 

between different processing levels than assumed 

within WEAVER
++
. Relevant studies include 

those by Costa et al. (2000) and Meyer and 

Damian (2007). There is also evidence (e.g., 

Smith & Wheeldon, 2004) that processing within 

sentences is more interactive than can be 

accounted for on WEAVER
++
.
Third, much of the evidence concerning 
speech errors suggests there is considerable 

parallel processing during speech production. 

Speech errors such as word-exchange errors, 

sound-exchange errors, the mixed-error effect, 

and the lexical bias effect are all somewhat 

difÞ
 cult to explain on WEAVER
++
. Rapp and 
Goldrick (2000, p. 478) carried out a computer 

simulation and found that, ÒA simulation 

incorporating the key assumptions of a discrete 

feedforward theory of spoken naming did 

not exhibit either mixed error or lexical bias 

effects.Ó
Fourth, as Harley (2008, p. 416) pointed 
out, ÒIt is "
Segment_773,not clear that the need for lemmas  such words were signiÞ cantly faster for bilinguals   than for monolinguals.

The tasks used in most of the research 
discussed up to this point have required the 

production of single words and so are far 

removed from speech production in everyday 

life. Can similar Þndings to those with single 

words be obtained when people have to pro-

duce entire sentences? Evidence that the answer 

is, ÒYesÓ, was reported by Smith and Wheeldon 

(2004). Participants described a moving scene 

presented to them. On some trials, they produced 

sentences involving two semantically related 

nouns (e.g., ÒThe saw and the axe move apartÓ). 

On other trials, the sentences to be produced 

involved two phonologically related nouns (e.g., 

ÒThe cat and the cap move upÓ). On still other 

trials, the two nouns were semantically and 

phonologically unrelated (e.g., ÒThe saw and 

the cat move downÓ).
What did Smith and Wheeldon (2004) Þ
 nd? 
First, there was a semantic interference effect 

even when the two nouns were in different 

phrases within the sentence. Second, there was 

a phonological facilitation effect, but only 

when the two nouns were in the same phrase. 

Both Þ ndings suggest strongly that there is 

more parallel processing of words within 

to-be-spoken sentences than assumed within 

WEAVER
++
, and this is more so with semantic 

processing than with phonological processing. 

The same conclusion follows from a considera-

tion of several of the speech errors discussed 

earlier in the chapter. Of particular relevance 

here are word-exchange and sound-exchange 

errors Ð the two words involved in word-

exchange errors tend to be further apart than 

those involved in sound-exchange errors. The 

take-home message is that planning of words 

(in terms of their meaning) precedes planning 

of sounds.

COGNITIVE 
NEUROPSYHOLOGY: 

SPEECH PRODUCTION
The cognitive neuropsychological approach to 
aphasia started in the nineteenth century. It has 

been claimed that some aphasic or language-

disordered patients have relatively intact access 

to syntactic information but impaired access 

to content words (e.g., nouns, verbs), whereas 

other aphasic patients show the opposite pattern. 

The existence of such a pattern (a double dis-

sociation) would support the notion that speech 

production involves separable stages of syntactic 

processing and word Þ
 nding, and would be 
consistent with theories such as spreading-

activation theory and WEAVER
++
.
There is a "

(2003) studied a patient with anomia, FAV, who 

described most scenes with normal ß
 uency. It 
seemed as if he had a feedback mechanism 

allowing him to predict in advance which words

According to Levelt et al.Õs (1999a)

 model, patients might have dif-

Þ
 culties in naming for two reasons. First, there 
could be a problem in lemma or abstract word 

selection, in which case naming errors would 

be similar in meaning to the correct word. 

Second, there could be a problem in word-form 

selection, in which case patients would be 

unable to Þ nd the appropriate phonological 

form of the word.
Evidence
A case of anomia involving a semantic impair-

ment (deÞ cient lemma selection?) was reported 

by Howard and Orchard-Lisle (1984). When 

the patient, JCU, named objects shown in 

pictures, she would often produce the wrong 

answer when given the Þ
 rst phoneme or sound 
of a word closely related to the target object. 

However, if she produced a name very different 

in meaning from the object depicted, she rejected 

it 86% of the time. JCU had access to 
some
 

semantic information but this was often insuf-

Þ
 cient for accurate object naming.
to BrocaÕs area. De Bleser also studied seven 

very clear cases of BrocaÕs aphasia. Four had 

damage to BrocaÕs area but the others had 

damage to WernickeÕs area.
According to Dick, Bates, Wulfeck, Utman, 
Dronkers, and Gernsbacher (2001), the notion 

that patients with BrocaÕs aphasia have much 

greater problems in speaking grammatically 

than patients with WernickeÕs aphasia may be 

incorrect. They pointed out that this Þ
 nding 
has been obtained in studies involving English-

speaking patients. In contrast, studies on patients 

who speak richly inß ected languages (e.g., Italian 

an"

How can we explain these   Þ  ndings? In most languages, grammatical changes  to nouns and verbs are indicated by changes to    the words the",Explores how attention influences cognition.,"recognition, emotion, attention",Nested under Chapter on awareness,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in recognition,Aligned with contemporary studies on awareness,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_1124,"d German) indicate that WernickeÕs aphasia 

patients make comparable numbers of gram-

matical errors to patients with BrocaÕs aphasia 

(Dick et al., 2001). How can we explain these 

Þ
 ndings? In most languages, grammatical changes 
to nouns and verbs are indicated by changes to  

the words themselves (e.g., the plural of 
ÒhousesÓ 

is ÒhousesÓ; the past tense of ÒseeÓ is Ò s
awÓ). This 
is known as inß ection. English is a less inß
 ected 
language than most. According to Dick et al. 

(2001), this is important. The fact that English is  

not a very inß ected language means that the gram-

matical limitations of English-speaking patients 

with WernickeÕs aphasia are less obvious than 

those of patients speaking other languages.
Evaluation
The distinction between BrocaÕs aphasia 

and WernickeÕs aphasia has become less popu-

lar for various reasons. First, both forms of 

aphasia are commonly associated with gram-

matical errors and word-Þ
 nding difÞ culties or 
anomia (discussed shortly), thus blurring the 

distinction.
Second, the terms BrocaÕs aphasia and 
WernickeÕs aphasia imply that numerous brain-

damaged patients all have similar patterns of 

language impairment. In fact, however, patients 

exhibit very different symptoms.
Third, the emphasis has shifted away from 
descriptions of broad patterns of language 

impairment towards systematic attempts to 

understand relatively speciÞ c cognitive impair-

ments. These more speciÞ c impairments include  
anomia:
 a condition caused by brain damage 
in which there is an impaired ability to name 

objects.

It is generally assumed theoretically that there 
are separate stages for working out the syntax 

or grammatical structure of utterances and for 

producing the content words to Þ t that gram-

matical structure (e.g., Del"
Segment_778,"l, 1986). Patients   who can apparently Þ nd the appropriate words    but not order them grammatically suffer from    agrammatism  or non-fluent aphasia, a con-  dition traditionally associated with BrocaÕs   area.

Patients 

who can apparently Þ nd the appropriate words  

but not order them grammatically suffer from
 

agrammatism
 or non-fluent aphasia, a con-

dition traditionally associated with BrocaÕs 

area. In the next section, we discuss patients 

with jargon aphasia, who allegedly have much 

greater problems with word Þ nding than with 

producing grammatical sentences. If such 

a double dissociation (see Glossary) could be 

found, it would support the view that there 

are separable stages of processing of grammar 

and word Þ
 nding.
Patients with agrammatism tend to pro-
duce short sentences containing content words 

(e.g., nouns, verbs) but lacking function words 

(e.g., the, in, and) and word endings. This makes 

good sense because function words play a key 

role in producing a grammatical structure for 

sentences. Finally, patients with agrammatism 

often have problems with the comprehension 

of syntactically complex sentences.
Evidence
Saffran, Schwartz, and Marin (1980a, 1980b) 

studied patients with agrammatism. One patient 

produced the following description of a woman 

kissing a man: ÒThe kiss . . . the lady kissed . . . 

the lady is . . . the lady and the man and the 

lady . . . kissing.Ó In addition, Saffran et al. 

found that agrammatic aphasics had great 

difÞ
 culty in putting the two nouns in the cor-
rect order when describing pictures containing 

two living creatures.
Kay and Ellis (1987) studied a patient, EST, 
who could apparently select the correct abstract  

word or lemma but not the phonological form 

of the word. He seemed to have no signiÞ
 cant 
impairment to his semantic system, but had 

great problems in Þ nding words other than 

very common ones. Kay and Ellis argued that 

his condition resembled, in greatly magniÞ
 ed 
form, that of the rest of us when in the tip-of-

the-tongue state.
Lambon Ralph, Moriarty, and Sage (2002) 
argued that the evidence on anomia could be 

explained without recourse to "
Segment_779,"lemmas or abstract   words. They assessed semantic /conceptual func-  tioning, phonological functioning, and lemma   functioning in aphasics. Their key Þ  nding was  that the extent of anomia shown by individual   aphasics was predicted well simply by consider-  ing their general semantic and phonol",Explores how memory influences cognition.,"emotion, memory, perception",Nested under Chapter on emotion,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in attention,Aligned with contemporary studies on awareness,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_853,"lemmas or abstract 

words. They assessed semantic /conceptual func-

tioning, phonological functioning, and lemma 

functioning in aphasics. Their key Þ
 nding was 
that the extent of anomia shown by individual 

aphasics was predicted well simply by consider-

ing their general semantic and phonological 

impairments. Thus, severe anomia was found 

in patients who had problems in accessing the 

meaning and the sounds of words. There was 

no evidence to indicate a role for an abstract 

lexical level of representation (i.e., the lemma).
Findings apparently inconsistent with those 
of Lambon Ralph were reported by Ingles, 

Fisk, Passmore, and Darvesh (2007). They 

studied a patient, MT, who had severe anomia 

with 
no
 apparent semantic or phonological 
impairment. Ingles et al. suggested that she 

might have an impairment in mapping semantic 

representations onto phonological ones even 

though both systems were intact. The fact that 

MT used the strategy of reciting the phonemes 

of the alphabet as cues to assist her retrieval 

of words is consistent with that suggestion.
Evaluation
Most research on anomia is consistent with 

Levelt et al.Õs (1999) notion that problems with 

word retrieval can occur at two different stages: 

(1) abstract word selection or lemma selection; 

and (2) accessing the phonological form of the 

word. However, a simpler explanation may well 

be preferable. According to this explanation, 

anomia occurs in patients as a fairly direct 

consequence of their semantic and phonological 

impairments.
agrammatism:
 a condition in which speech 
production lacks grammatical structure and 

many function words and word endings are 

omitted; often also associated with 

comprehension difÞ culties.

(Harley, 2008). Some of this variation can be 
explained with reference to a model proposed 
"
Segment_780,"by Grodzinsky and Friederici (2006), who   argued that different aspects of syntactic pro-  cessing occur in different brain areas. They   used evidence mainly from functional neuro-  imaging to identify three phases of syntactic   processing, together with the brain areas   involved (see Figure 11",Explores how recognition influences cognition.,"emotion, attention, perception",Nested under Chapter on attention,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in emotion,Aligned with contemporary studies on memory,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_122,"
by Grodzinsky and Friederici (2006), who 

argued that different aspects of syntactic pro-

cessing occur in different brain areas. They 

used evidence mainly from functional neuro-

imaging to identify three phases of syntactic 

processing, together with the brain areas 

involved (see Figure 11.7):
At this phase, local phrase structures are 
(1) 
formed after word category information 

(e.g., noun; verb) has been identiÞ
 ed. The 
frontal operculum and anterior superior 

temporal gyrus are involved.

At this phase, dependency relationships 
(2) 
among the various sentence elements are 

calculated (i.e., who is doing what to whom?). 

BrocaÕ
s area (BA44/45) is involved. For 
example, Friederici, Fiebach, Schlewesky
, 
Bornkessel, and von Cramon (2006) found  

that activation in BrocaÕs area was greater 

with syntactically complex sentences than 

with syntactically simple ones. This is the 

phase of most relevance to agrammatism.
Evidence that agrammatic patients have 
particular problems in processing function words 

was reported by Biassou, Obler, Nespoulous, 

Dordain, and Harris (1997). Agrammatic patients 

given the task of reading words made signiÞ
 -
cantly more phonological errors on function 

words than on content words. Guasti and 

Luzzatti (2002) found that agrammatic patients 

often failed to adjust the form of verbs to take 

account of person or number, and mostly used 

only the present tense of verbs.
Beeke, Wilkinson, and Maxim (2007) 
argued that the artiÞ cial tasks (e.g., picture 

description) used in most research may have 

led researchers to 
underestimate
 the gram-

matical abilities of agrammatic patients. 

They supported this argument in a study on 

a patient with agrammatism who completed 

tests of spoken sentence construction and 

was videotaped having a conversation at home 

with a family member. His speech appeared 

more grammatical in the more naturalistic 

situation.

Jargon aphasia
Patients with agrammatism can Þ
 nd the content 
words they want to say but cannot produce 
grammatically correct sentences. Patients 

suffering from 
jargon aphasia
 apparently show 

the opposite pattern. They seem to speak fairly 

grammatically, leading many experts to assume 

they have a largely intact syntactic level of 

processing. Unlike patients with agrammatism, 

jargon aphasics experience great difÞ
 culty in 
Þ
 nding the right words. They often substitute 
one word for another and also produce 
neo-

logisms
 (made-up words; see below). Finally, 

jargon aphasics typically seem unaware that 

their speech contains numerous errors, and can 

become irritated when others do not understand 

them (see Marshall, 2006, for a review).
We can illustrate the speech errors made by  
jargon aphasics by considering RD (Ellis, Miller, 

and Sin, 1983). Here is his description of a 

picture of a scout camp (the words he seemed 

to be searching for are given in brackets):
A b-boy is swiÕing (SWINGING) on 

the bank with his hand (FEET) in 

the stringt (STREAM). A table with 

ostrum (SAUCEP

Burkhardt, Avrutin, Pi
n
ango, and Ruigendijk 
(2008) argued that agrammatic patients have 

limited processing capacity speciÞ
 cally affecting 
syntactic processing. Agrammatics were reason-

ably successful at resolving syntactic complexities  

in sentences, but took a considerable amount 

of time to do so. The implication was that they 

had a processing limitation rather than loss of 

the necessary syntactic knowledge. Within the 

context of Grodzinsky and FriedericiÕs (2006) 

model, this effect would be mainly at the second 

phase of syntactic processing.
Evaluation
Research on agrammatism supports the notion 

that speech production involves a syntactic 

level at which the grammatical structure of a 

sentence is formed. Progress has been made in 

identifying reasons why individuals with agram-

matism have problems in syntactic comprehen-

sion and grammatical speech. They often seem to  

have reduced resources for syntactic processing. 

Evidence that different brain areas are involved 

in different aspects of syntactic processing may 

prove of lasting value in developing an under-

standing of the various symptoms associated 

with agrammatism.
What are the limitations of research on 
agrammatism? First, as Harley (2008, p. 438) 

pointed out, ÒIf it [i.e., agrammatism] is a 

meaningful syndrome, we should Þ
 nd that

element loss, and a syntactic comprehension

the target word. Second, a jargon aphasic, LT, 
had a strong tendency to produce consonants 

common in the English language regardless of 

whether they were correct when he was picture 

naming (Robson, Pring, Marshall, & Chiat, 

2003). Third, Goldman, Schwartz, and Wilshire 

(2001) found evidence suggesting that jargon 

aphasics tend to include recently used phonemes  

in neologisms, presumably because they still 

retained some activation.
Why
 are jargon aphasics poor at monitor-
ing 
and correcting their own speech? Several 
answers have been suggested (Marshall, 2006). 

One possibility is that jargon aphasics Þ
 nd it 
hard to speak and to monitor their own speech 

at the same time. Some support for that hypo-

thesis was reported by Shuren, Hammond, Maher, 

Roth, and Heilman (1995). A jargon aphasic 

indicated whether his responses on a picture 

naming test were correct. His judgements were 

right 90% of the time when he listened to a 

tape of his own voice some time after perform-

ing the test compared to only 6.7% right when 

he made immediate judgements.
Another possibility was suggested by Mar-
shall, Robson, Pring, and Chiat (1998). They 

studied a jargon aphasic, CM, who named 

pictures and repeated words he had produced 

on the naming task. He was much be"

[CMÕs] monitoring difÞ culties arise when he is 

accessing phono logy from semantics.Ó This ability 

was re quired when naming pictures because 

he had to access the meaning of each picture 

(semantics) before deciding how to pronounce 

its name (phonology).
Evaluation
We have an increased understanding of the 

processes underlying the neologisms produced 

by jargon aphasics. However, it is unclear 

whether the same processes are responsible for 

neologisms resembling the target word phono-

logically closely or not at all. In addition, there 

are several possible reasons why jargon aphasics 

fail to monitor their own speech effectively for 
impaired jargon aphasic can still communicate 

a great deal. They can convey anger, delight, 

puzzlement, surprise, and humour.Ó
Evidence
How grammatical is the speech of jargon 

aphasics? The fact that they produce numerous 

neologisms makes it hard to answer this question. 

However, the neologisms they produce are often 

imbedded within phrase structures (Marshall, 

2006). If jargon aphasics have some ability to 

engage in syntactic processing, their neologisms 

or made-up words might possess appropriate 

preÞ
 xes or sufÞ xes to Þ t into the syntactic 
structure of the sentence. For example, if the 

neologism refers to the past participle of a 

verb, it might end in Ð ed. Evidence that jargon 

aphasics do modify their neologisms to make 

them Þ t syntactically was reported by Butter-

worth (1985).
Some of the problems in assessing jargon 
aphasicsÕ grammaticality can be seen if we 

consider the following utterance (taken from 

Butterworth & Howard, 1987): ÒIsnÕt look 

very dear, is it?Ó The sentence certainly looks 

ungrammatical. However, Butterworth and 

Howard argued that the patient had blended 

or combined two syntactic options (i."
Segment_785,"e., ÒdoesnÕt   look very dearÓ and ÒisnÕt very dearÓ). Why  do jargon aphasics produce neolo- gisms? Some of their neologisms are phono-  logically related to the target word, whereas   others are almost unrelated phonologically, and   it is unclear whether the same mechanisms are   involved. Olson,",Explores how attention influences cognition.,"recognition, perception, emotion",Nested under Chapter on perception,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in awareness,Aligned with contemporary studies on awareness,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_917,"e., ÒdoesnÕt 

look very dearÓ and ÒisnÕt very dearÓ).
Why
 do jargon aphasics produce neolo-
gisms? Some of their neologisms are phono-

logically related to the target word, whereas 

others are almost unrelated phonologically, and 

it is unclear whether the same mechanisms are 

involved. Olson, Romani, and Halloran (2007) 

studied VS, an 84-year-old woman with jargon 

aphasia. Her neologisms (regardless of how 

phonologically related to target words) were 

affected in similar ways by factors such as word 

frequency, imageability, and length, suggesting 

that there might be a single underlying deÞ
 cit. 
Olson et al. concluded that this deÞ
 cit may 
occur at a level of phonological encoding that 

follows immediately after lexical access.
What
 determines the phonemes found 
in the neologisms of jargon aphasics? We will 

consider three factors. First, as we have seen, 

some of the phonemes often resemble those in

WRITING: THE MAIN 
PROCESSES
Writing involves the retrieval and organisation 
of information stored in long-term memory. In 

addition, it involves complex thought processes. 

This has led several theorists (e.g., Kellogg, 

1994; Oatley & Djikic, 2008) to argue that 

writing is basically a form of thinking. According 

to Kellogg (1994, p. 13), ÒI regard thinking 

and writing as twins of mental life. The study 

of the more expressive twin, writing, can offer 

insights into the psychology of thinking, the 

more reserved member of the pair.Ó Thus, 

although writing is an important topic in its 

own right (no pun intended!), it is 
not
 separate 
from other cognitive activities.
The development of literacy (including 
writing skills) can enhance thinking ability. 

Luria (1976) studied two groups in Uzbekistan 

in the early 1930s, only one of which had 

received brief training in literacy. Both groups 

were asked various questions including the 

following: ÒIn the Far North, where there is 

snow, all bears are white. Novaya Zemlya is 

in the Far North. What colour are the bears 

there?Ó Only 27% of those who were illiterate 

produced the right answer compared to 100% 

of those who had partial literacy.
Key processes
Hayes and Flower (1986) identiÞ ed three key 

writing processes:
The 
(1) 
planning process
: this involves pro-
ducing ideas and organising them into a 

writing plan to satisfy the writerÕs goals.
One of the three key processes in writing is the 
revision process, in which we evaluate what we 

have written.This can occur at all levels from 

individual words to the entire structure of our 

writing.

Metacognitive knowledge

Hayes and Flower (1986) also identified 

strategic knowledge as important. This concerns 
ways of organising the goals and sub-goals of 

writing to construct a coherent writing plan. 

Good writers use strategic knowledge ß
 exibly 
to change the structure of the writing plan if 

problems arise.
Sentence generation
Kaufer, Hayes, and Flower (1986) found that 

essays were always at least eight times longer 

than outlines or writing plans. The technique 

of asking writers to think aloud permitted 

Kaufer et al. to explore the process of sentence 

generation. Expert and average writers accepted 

about 75% of the sentence parts they verba-

lised. The length of the average sentence part was 

11.2 words for the expert writers compared to 

7.3 words for the average writers. Thus, good 

writers use larger units or Òbuilding blocksÓ.
Revision
Revision is a key (and often underestimated) 

process in writing. Expert writers devote more 

of their writing time to revision than non-

expert ones (Hayes & Flower, 1986). Of 

importance, expert writers focus more on the 

coherence and structure of the arguments ex-

pressed. Faigley and Witte (1983) found that 

34% of revisions by experienced adult writers 

involved a change of meaning against only 

12% of the revisions by inexperienced college 

writers.
Evaluation
No one denies that planning, sentence genera-

tion, and revision are all important processes 

in writing. However, these three processes can-

not be neatly separated. We saw that in the 

study by Levy and Ransdell (1995). In addition, 

the processes of planning and sentence genera-

tion are almost inextricably bound up with"
Segment_788,"each other. Kellogg (1994) discussed studies involving dir-  e  cted retrospection.

Kellogg (1994) discussed studies involving dir-

e 
cted retrospection. On average, writers devoted 
about 30% of their time to planning, 50% to 

sentence generation, and 20% to revision.
Levy and Ransdell (1995) analysed writing 
processes systematically. As well as asking their 

participants to verbalise what they were doing, 

Levy and Ransdell obtained videorecordings 

as they wrote essays on computers. The per-

centage of time devoted to planning decreased 

from 40 to 30% during the course of the study. 

Surprisingly, the length of time spent on each 

process before moving on to another process 

was often very short. In the case of text genera-

tion, the median time was 7.5 seconds, and it 

was only 2.5 seconds for planning, reviewing, 

and revising. These Þ ndings suggest that the 

various processes involved in writing are heavily 

interdependent and much less separate than 

we might imagine.
Levy and Ransdell (1995) reported a Þ
 nal 
interesting Þ
 nding Ð writers were only partially 
aware of how they allocated time. Most over-

estimated the time spent on reviewing and 

revising, and underestimated the time spent on 

generating text. The writers estimated that they 

spent just over 30% of their time reviewing 

and revising, but actually devoted only 5% of 

their time to those activities!
Kellogg (1988) considered the effects of 
producing an outline (focus on the main themes) 

on subsequent letter writing. Producers of out-

lines spent more time in sentence generation 

than no-outline participants, but less time in 

planning and reviewing or revising. Producing 

an outline increased the quality of the letter. 

Why was this? Producers of outlines did not 

have to devote so much time to planning, 

which is the hardest process in writing.
Planning
Writing depends heavily on the writerÕs know-

ledge. Alexander, Schallert, and Hare (1991)

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
With increasing writing expertise, most 
adolescents shift from the knowledge-telling 
strategy to the knowledge-transforming strategy. 

This involves use of a 
rhetorical 
problem space
 
and a content problem space. Rhetorical problems 

relate to the achievement of the goals of the 

writing task (e.g., ÒCan I strengthen the argu-

ment?Ó), whereas content 
problems relate to 

the specific information to be 
written down 
(e.g., ÒThe case of Smith vs. Jones strengthens 

the argumentÓ). There 
should be movement 

of information in both 
directions between the 

content space and the rhetorical space. This 

happens more often with skilled writers.
Bereiter, Burtis, and Scardamalia (1988) 
argued that knowledge-transforming strategists 

would be more likely than knowledge-telling 

strategists to produce high-level main points 

capturing important themes. Children and adults 

wrote an essay. Those producing a high-level 

main point used on average 4.75 different know-

ledge-transforming processes during planning. 

In contrast, those producing a low-level main 

point used only 0.23 knowledge-transforming 

processes on average.
Successful use of the planning process also 
depends on the writerÕs relevant knowledge. Adults 

possessing either much knowledge or relatively 

little on a topic were compared by Hayes and 

Flower (1986). The experts produced more goals 

and sub-goals, and so constructed a more complex 

overall writing plan. In addition, the expertsÕ 

various goals were much more interconnected.
Expert writers also differ from non-expert 
ones in their ability to use the revision process. 

Hayes, Flower, Schriver, Stratman, and Carey 

(1985) found that expert writers

The 

expert writers correctly identiÞ
 e d  the nature of  
the problem in 74% of cases against

for the non-expert writers.
Levy and Ransdell (1995) found that writers 
who produced the best essays spent 40% more 

of their time reviewing and revising them than 

those producing the essays of poorest quality. 

Revisions made towards the end of the writing 

session were especially important.
Another issue is that Hayes and Flower 
(1986) de-emphasised the social aspect of much 

writing. As is discussed shortly, writers need 

to take account of the intended readership for 

the texts they produce. This is one of the most 

difÞ
 cult tasks faced by writers, especially when 
the readership is likely to consist of individuals 

having very different amounts of relevant 

knowledge.
Writing expertise
Why
 are some writers more skilful than others? 

As with any complex cognitive skill, extensive 

and deliberate practice over a prolonged period 

of time is very important (see Chapter 12). 

Practice can help to provide writers with addi-

tional relevant knowledge, the ability to write 

faster (e.g., using word processing), and so on. 

We will see shortly that the working memory 

system (see Chapter 6) plays a very important 

role in writing. All of the components of work-

ing memory have limited capacity, and it is 

likely that writing demands on these com-

ponents decrease with practice. That would 

provide experienced writers with spare process-

ing capacity to enhance the quality of what 

they are writing.
Individual differences in writing ability 
probably depend mostly on planning and revi-

sion processes. Bereiter and Scardamalia (1987) 

argued that two major strategies are used in 

the planning stage:
A knowledge-telling strategy.
(1) 
A knowledge-transforming strategy.
(2) 
The knowledge-telling strategy involves 
writers simply writing down everything they 

know about a topic with minimal planning.

of the knowledge possessed by others made 
their texts more understandable.
Instructing writers explicitly to consider the 
readerÕs needs often produces beneÞ
 cialresults. 
Holloway and McCutcheon (2004) found that 

the revisions made to a text by students aged 

about 11 or 15 were improved by the instruction 

to Òread-as-the-readerÓ. However, 
feedback
 from 

readers is especially effective. Schriver (1984) 

asked students to read an imperfect text and 

predict the comprehension problems another 

reader would have. Then the students read a 

readerÕs verbal account produced while he/she 

tried to understand that text. After the students 
Knowledge-crafting: focus on 
the reader
Kellogg (2008) argued that really expert writers 
attain the knowledge-crafting stage. This is an 

advance on the knowledge-transforming stage: 

ÒIn . . . knowledge-crafting, the writer is able to 

hold in mind the authorÕs ideas, the words of 

the text itself, and the imagined readerÕs inter-

pretation of the textÓ (p. 5). As can be seen 

in Figure 11.8, the distinctive feature of the 

knowledge-crafting stage is its focus on the 

readerÕs needs.
It is important to consider the reader because 
of the

ordinating cognitive activities. Other components 
of the working memory system are the visuo-

spatial sketchpad (involved in visual and spatial 

processing) and the phonological loop (involved 

in verbal rehearsal). All of these components 

have limited capacity. As we will see, writing 

can involve any or all of these working memory 

components (see Olive, 2004, for a review).
Evidence
According to KelloggÕs working memory theory, 

all the main processes involved in writing depend 

on the central executive component of working 

memory. As a consequence, writing quality is 

likely to suffer if 
any
 writing process is made 

more difÞ cult. As predicted, the quality of the 

written texts was lower when the text had to 

be written in capital letters rather than in normal 

handwriting (Olive & Kellogg, 2002).
How can we assess the involvement of the 
central executive in writing? One way is to 

measure reaction times to auditory probes 

presented in isolation (control condition) or 

while 
participants are engaged on a writing task. 
If writi"
Segment_793,"ng uses much of the available capacity   of working memory (especially the central   executive), then reaction times should be longer   in the writing condition.

conditions:

: a text had

Olive and Kellogg (2002) found that 
composition was more demanding than trans-

cription (see Figure 11.9), because composition
 
involves planning and sentence generation. In 
had been given various texts plus readersÕ 

accounts, they became better at predicting the 

problems readers would have with new texts.
Sato and Matsushima (2006) found the 
quality of text writing by 15-year-old students 

was not improved by instructing them to attend 

to potential readers, perhaps because the 

instructions were not sufficiently detailed. 

However, feedback from the readers about 

the comprehension problems they encountered 

was effective, and the beneÞ ts transferred to 

subsequent writing.
Carvalho (2002) used a broader approach 
based on procedural facilitation. In this tech-

nique, writers evaluate what they have written 

for relevance, repetition, missing details, and 

clarity to readers after writing each sentence. 

Student participants exposed to this technique 

wrote more effectively and were more responsive 

to readersÕ needs subsequently.

on producing text they Þ

reduced by providing writers with detailed 

feedback from readers.
Working memory
Most people Þ nd writing difÞ cult and effortful, 

because it involves several different cognitive 

processes such as attention, thinking, and 

memory. According to Kellogg (2001a, p. 43), 

ÒMany kinds of writing tasks impose consider-

able demands on working memory, the system 

responsible for processing and storing information 

on a short-term basis.Ó The key component of 

the working memory system (discussed at length 

in Chapter 6) is the central executive, an attention-

like process involved in organising and co-

indicating that all three writing processes are 
very demanding. Second, reviewing was more 

demanding than planning and translating. Third, 

word processing was more demanding than 

writing in longhand.
Why
 is reviewing/revising the text that has 
been produced so demanding? According to 

Hayes (2004), text reviewing or revision involves 

language comprehension processes plus addi-

tional processes (e.g., problem solving and 

decision making). Roussey and Piolat (2008) 

used the probe technique, and found that re-

viewing was more demanding of processing 

resources than comprehension. This was more 

so for participants low in working memory 

capacity (see Chapter 10), suggesting that text 

reviewing or revising is especially demanding 

for such individuals.
Vanderberg and Swanson (2007) adopted 
an individual-difference approach to assess the 

involvement of the central e"

They considered writing performance at the   general  (e.g., planning, sentence generation,   revision) and at the  speciÞ  c  (e.g., grammar,  punctuation) levels.

revision) and at the 
speciÞ
 c
 (e.g., grammar, 
punctuation) levels. Individuals with the most 

effective central executive functioning had the 

best writing performance at both levels.
What about the other components of 
working memory? Chenoweth and Hayes (2003) 

asked participants to perform the task of typing 

sentences to describe cartoons on its own or 

while repeating a syllable continuously (syllable 

repetition uses the phonological loop and is 

known as articulatory suppression). Articulatory 

suppression caused writers to produce shorter 

sequences of words in rapid succession, sug-

gesting that it suppressed their Òinner voiceÓ. 

It could be argued that the reason why articula-

tory suppression impaired writing performance 

was because the writing task was a fairly com-

plex one. Hayes and Chenoweth (2006) invest-

igated this issue by asking their participants 

to trans cribe or copy texts from one computer 

window to another. In spite of the apparent 

simplicity of this writing task, participants 

transcribed more slowly and made more errors 

when the task was accompanied by articulatory 

suppression.
addition, composition 
+
 transcription is more 

demanding than composition. Thus, writers 

can apparently engage in higher-level processes 

(e.g., planning) 
and
 lower-level processes (writing 
words) at the same time.
Kellogg (2001a) assumed that writers with 
much relevant knowledge about an essay topic 

would have large amounts of well-organised 

information stored in long-term memory. This 

knowledge should reduce the effort involved 

in writing an essay. He asked students with 

varying degrees of relevant knowledge to write 

an essay about baseball, and used the probe 

technique to assess processing demands. As

quality of writing and on the processes used 

during writing. However, research to date has 

barely addressed these issues (e.g., Roussey & 

Piolat, 2008).
Word processing
There has been a substantial increase in the 

use of word processors in recent years. Most 

evidence suggests that this is a good thing. 

Goldberg, Russell, and Cook (2003) carried 

out meta-analyses (combining Þ
 ndings from 
many studies) to compare writing performance 

when students used word processors or wrote 

in longhand. Here are their conclusions: ÒStudents 

who use computers when learning to write are 

not only more engaged in their writing but 

they produce work that is of greater length 

and higher qualityÓ (p. 1). One reason why 

word processing leads to enhanced writing 

quality is because word-processed essays tend 

to be better organised than those w"
Segment_797,"ritten in   longhand (Whithaus, Harrison, & Midyette,   2008). Kellogg and Mueller (1993) compared  text produced by word processor and by   writing in longhand. There were only small   differences in writing quality or the speed   at which text was produced. However, use   of the probe technique in",Explores how perception influences cognition.,"awareness, recognition, perception",Nested under Chapter on emotion,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in attention,Aligned with contemporary studies on awareness,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_988,"ritten in 

longhand (Whithaus, Harrison, & Midyette, 

2008).
Kellogg and Mueller (1993) compared 
text produced by word processor and by 

writing in longhand. There were only small 

differences in writing quality or the speed 

at which text was produced. However, use 

of the probe technique indicated that word 

processing involved more effortful planning 

and revision (but not sentence generation) 

than writing in longhand. Those using word 

processors were much less likely than those 

writing in longhand to make notes (12% versus 

69%, respectively), which may explain the 

Þ ndings.
In sum, we should not expect word pro-
cessing to have a dramatic impact on writing 

quality. Factors such as access to relevant 

knowledge, skill at generating sentences, and 

ability to revise text effectively are essential to 

high-quality writing, and it is not clear whether 

these factors are much inß uenced by the way 

in which the text is written.
We turn now to the visuo-spatial sketchpad. 
Levy and Ransdell (2001) found that a visuo-

spatial task (detecting when two consecutive 

characters were in the same place or were similar 

in colour) increased writersÕ initial planning time. 

Kellogg, Oliver, and Piolat (2007) asked students 

to write descriptions of concrete (e.g., house; 

pencil) and abstract (e.g., freedom; duty) nouns 

while performing a detection task. The writing 

task slowed detection times for visual stimuli 

only
 when concrete words were being described. 

Thus, the visuo-spatial sketchpad is more involved 

when writers are thinking about concrete objects 

than abstract ones.
Evaluation
The main writing processes are very demanding 

or effortful and make substantial demands on 

working memory (especially the central execu-

tive). The demands on the central executive may 

be especially great during revision or reviewing 

(Kellogg, 2001b; Roussey & Piolat, 2008). The 

phonological loop and the visuo-spatial sketchpad 

are also "
Segment_798,"both involved in the writing process.   However, the involvement of the visuo-spatial   sketchpad depends on the type of text being   produced (Kellogg et al., 2007). It is not clear   that writing performance  necessarily  depends   on the involvement of the phonological  loop.  Some patients with",Explores how memory influences cognition.,"perception, awareness, emotion",Nested under Chapter on memory,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in recognition,Aligned with contemporary studies on attention,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_1254,"both involved in the writing process. 

However, the involvement of the visuo-spatial 

sketchpad depends on the type of text being 

produced (Kellogg et al., 2007). It is not clear 

that writing performance 
necessarily
 depends 

on the involvement of the phonological
 loop. 
Some patients with a severely impaired phono-

logical loop nevertheless have essentially 

normal written language (Gathercole & Baddeley, 

1993).
The main limitation of KelloggÕs theoretical 
approach is that it does not indicate clearly 

why
 processes such as planning or sentence 

generation are so demanding. We need a more 

Þ
 ne-grain analysis of writersÕ strategies during 
the planning process. The theory focuses on 

the effects of writing processes on working 

memory. However, working memory limita-

tions probably inß
 uence 
how
 we allocate our 
limited resources during writing. For example, 

we may shift rapidly from one writing process 

to another when our processing capacity is in 

danger of being exceeded. It would be useful 

to know more about the ways in which the 

various components of working memory 
interact

SPELLING
Spelling is an important aspect of writing, and 
has been the subject of considerable research 

interest. We will base our discussion on a theor-

etical sketch map of the main processes and 

structures involved in spelling heard words 

according to Goldberg and Rapp (2008; see 

Figure 11.10):
There are two main routes between hearing
†
a word and spelling it: (1) the lexical route

(left-hand side of Figure 11.10) and the

non-lexical route (right-hand side). There

are some similarities here with the dual-route

cascaded model of reading (Coltheart et al.,

2001, see Chapter 9).

The lexical route contains the informa-
†
tion needed to relate phonological (sound),

semantic (meaning), and orthographic (spe"
Segment_799,"ll-  ing) representations of  words to each other. Thus, this route to spelling a heard word   involves accessing detailed information   about all features of the word. It is the main  route we use when spelling familiar words  whether the relationship between the sound   units (phonemes) and units",Explores how perception influences cognition.,"perception, attention, emotion",Nested under Chapter on attention,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in attention,Aligned with contemporary studies on recognition,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_15,"ll-

ing) representations of 
words to each other.
Thus, this route to spelling a heard word 

involves accessing detailed information 

about all features of the word. It is the main 
route we use when spelling familiar words 
whether the relationship between the sound
 
units (phonemes) and units of written 

language (graphemes) is regular (e.g., ÒcatÓ) 

or irregular (e.g., ÒyachtÓ).

The non-lexical route does 
†
not
 involve gaining
access to detailed information about the 

sound, meaning, and spelling of heard words.
 
Instead, this route uses stored rules to con-

vert sounds or phonemes into groups of
 
letters or graphemes. We use this route when  

spelling unfamiliar words or nonwords. It 

produces correct spellings when the relation-

ship between phonemes and graphemes is 

regular or common (e.g., ÒcatÓ). However, 

it produces systematic spelling errors when 

the relationship is irregular or uncommon 

(e.g., ÒyachtÓ; ÒcombÓ).

would have some success in generating appro-
priate spellings of nonwords. In addition, he/

she would be more accurate at spelling regular 

words (i.e., words where the spelling can be 

worked out from the sound) than irregular 

words. Patients with these symptoms suffer from 

surface dysgraphia
. Macoir and Bernier (2002)

better for words about which she could access 

semantic information than those about which 

she could not (85% versus 19%, respectively). 

This makes sense given that the 
semantic system 

forms part of the 
lexical 
route.
Strong evidence that patients with surface 
dysgraphia often have poor access to lexical 

information about words was reported by 

Bormann, Wallesch, Seyboth, and Blanken 

(2009). They studied MO, a male German 

patient. When he heard two words (e.g., Òlass 

dasÓ meaning Òleave itÓ), he often wrote them 

as a single meaningless word (e.g., ÒlasdasÓ).
Are the two routes independent?
We have seen that an important distinction 

exists between lexical and non-lexical routes 

to spelling. Do these two routes operate inde-

pendently or do they interact with each other? 

There is increasing evidence that they often inter-

act. Rapp, Epstein, and Tainturier (2002) studied 

LAT, a patient w it h  
AlzheimerÕs disease. He made  
many errors in spelling, but used 
the phonemeÐ

grapheme system reasonably well.He 
showed  
Both routes make use of a 
†
graphemic buffer
.
This brieß y holds graphemic representations
consisting of abstract letters or letter groups

just before they are written or typed.
Lexical route: phonological 
dysgraphia
What would happen if a brain-damaged patient 
could make very little use of the non-lexical 

route but the lexical route was essentially intact? 

He/she would spell known words accurately, 

because their spellings would be available in 

the orthographic output lexicon. However, 

there would be great problems with unfamiliar 

words and nonwords for which relevant informa-

tion is 
not
 contained in the orthographic out-

put lexicon. The term 
phonological dysgraphia
 
is applied to patients with these symptoms. 

Several patients with phonological dysgraphia 

have been studied. Shelton and Weinrich (1997) 

studied a patient, EA, who could not write 

correctly any of 55 nonwords to dictation. 

H"
Segment_801,"owever, the patient wrote 50% of regular   words and 45% of irregular words correctly.

A simpler hypothesis to explain the spelling  
problems of patients with phonological dys-

graphia is that they have a severe deÞ
 cit with 
phonological processing (processing involving 

the sounds of words). According to this hypo-

thesis, such patients should have problems on 

any
 task involving phonological processing 

even if it did not involve spelling at all. Rapcsak 

et al. (2009) obtained support for this hypo-

thesis. Patients with phonological dysgraphia 

performed poorly on phonological tasks such as  

deciding whether two words rhymed or pro-

ducing a word rhyming with a target word.
Non-lexical route: surface 
dysgraphia
If a patient had damage to the lexical route 
and so relied largely on the phonemeÐ grapheme  

conversion system in spelling, what would 

happen? Apart from producing misspellings 

sounding like the relevant word, such a patient

 a store in which graphemic 
information about the individual letters in a word  

is held immediately before spelling the word.

phonological dysgraphia:
 a condition caused 

by brain damage in which familiar words can be 

spelled reasonably well but nonwords cannot.

surface dysgraphia:
 a condition caused by 

brain damage in which there is poor spelling of 

irregular words, reasonable spelling of regular 

words, and some success in spelling nonwords.

made a few semantic errors, and his spelling 

was affected by word concreteness and word 

class (e.g., noun; verb). Of particular impor-

produced Òfragment errorsÓ, which involved 

omitting two or more letters when writing a 

word. This may have happened because the 

letter information reaching his graphemic 

buffer was degraded.
Graphemic buffer
The lexical and non-lexical routes both lead 

to the graphemic buffer (see Figure 11.10). It 

is a memory store in which graphemic informa-

tion about the letters in a word is held brieß
 y 
prior to spelling it. Suppose a brain-damaged 

patient had damage to the graphemic buffer 

so that information in it decayed unusually 

rapidly. As a result, spelling errors should increase 

with word length. This is what has been found 

(see Glasspool, Shallice, & Cipolotti, 2006, for 

a review). In addition, individuals with damage 

to the graphemic buffer make more spelling 

errors in the middle of words than at the start 

and end of words. Many of these spelling errors 

involve transposing letters because it is especially 

difÞ
 cult to keep track of the correct sequence 
of letters in the middle of words.

that LAT was using the non-lexical route.
Rapp et al. found that LAT made other errors 
suggesting he was using 
the lexical route. For 

example, he spelled ÒbouquetÓ as BOUKET 

and ÒknowledgeÓ as KNOLIGE. These spell-

ings suggest some use of the non-lexical route.

Suppose we asked healthy participants 
to spell various words and nonwords. If the 

two routes are independent, we would expect 

the spelling of nonwords to involve 
only
 the 

phonemeÐgrapheme conversion system within 

the non-lexical route. In fact, there are lexical 

inß
 uences on nonword spelling (Campbell, 1983; 
Perry, 2003). For example, an ambiguous spoken 

nonword (vi:m in the international phonetic 

alphabet) was more likely to be spelled as 

VEAM after participants had heard the word 

ÒteamÓ, as VEEM after the word ÒdeemÓ, and 

as VEME after the word ÒthemeÓ.
Delattre, Bonin, and Barry (2006) com-
pared speed of written spelling of regular and 

irregular words in healthy participants. A key 

difference between these two categories of 

words is that irregular words produce a 
conß
 ict
 
between the outputs of the lexical and non-

lexical routes, whereas regular ones do not. Thus, 

Þ
 nding that it takes longer to write irregular 
than regular words would provide evidence 

that the two routes interact with each other. 

That is precisely what Delattre et al. found.

For example, he was very 

good at deciding which of two homophones 

(e.g., obeyÐobay) was correct. There are many 

other similar cases (see Tainturier & Rapp, 

2001, for a review). The limitation with such 

evidence is that full knowledge of the letters 

in a word is essential for spelling but is often 

not needed for accurate reading. Thus, there 

may be many patients with poorer spelling 

than reading simply because spelling is a harder 

task. For example, MLB was a French woman 

whose ability to spell irregular words was very 

poor. However, she performed at chance level 

on the difÞ
 cult reading task of deciding which 
letter strings formed words when the nonwords 

were pronounced the same as actual words 

(e.g., BOATH; SKOOL) (Tainturier, 1996).
What Þ ndings suggest that there is only 
one orthographic lexicon? First, most brain-

damaged patients with a reading impairment 

(dyslexia) generally also have a spelling impair-

ment (dysgraphia), and the reverse is often also 

the case. In addition, patients having particular 

problems with reading nonwords typically also 

have speciÞ c problems in spelling nonwords, 

and those who Þ nd it hard to read irregular 

words generally have difÞ culties in spelling such  

words (see Tainturier & Rapp, 2001). Some 

patients even show great similarity between 

the speciÞ
 c words they can read and those they 
can spell (Berhmann & Bub, 1992).
Second, Holmes and Carruthers (1998) 
presented normal participants with Þ
 ve versions  
of words they could not spell: the correct version; 

their own misspelling; the most popular mis-

spelling (if it differed from their own mis-

s pelling); and two or three other misspellings. 

The participants showed 
no
 ability to select 

the correct spelling over their own misspelling 

regardless of their conÞ
 dence in their decisions

which research has revealed a surprising degree 

of complexity about the processes involved 

in spelling. There is reasonable evidence that 

the spelling of heard words can be based on 

a lexical route or a non-lexical route. Some of 

the strongest support comes from studies on 

individuals with surface dysgraphia having a 

severely impaired lexical route and from those 

with phonological dysgraphia having a severely 

impaired non-lexical route. The lexical route, 

with its phonological input lexicon, semantic 

system, and orthographic input lexicon, is much 

more complex than the non-lexical route, and 

it is not surprising that some individuals (e.g., 

those with deep dysgraphia) have a partially 

intact and partially impaired lexical route.
What are the limitations of theory and 
research in this area? First, the notion that 

phonological dysgraphia is due to a 
speciÞ c
 

problem with turning sounds into groups of 

letters may be incorrect. It is entirely possible 

that phonological dysgraphia involves a much 

more
 general
 problem with phonological pro-

cessing. 
Second, we need to know more 
about 
the interactions between the two routes assumed 

to be involved in spelling. Third, the precise rules 

used in phonemeÐgrapheme conversion have 

not been clearly identiÞ ed. Fourth, much remains  

to be discovered about the ways in which the 

three components of the lexical route combine 

to produce spellings of heard words.
How many orthographic lexicons 
are there?
Knowledge of word spellings is important in 
reading and writing. The simplest assumption 

is that there is a 
single
 orthographic lexicon used 
for both reading and spelling. An alternative 

assumption is that an input orthographic lexicon 

is used in reading and a separate orthographic 

output lexicon is used in spelling.

reading and spelling tasks for words and pseudo-
words was associated with damage in a shared 

network in the left hemisphere. This suggests 

that common brain areas are involved in reading  

and spelling words, and is consistent with the 

notion of a single orthographic lexicon.
Evaluation
It is very hard to obtain deÞ nitive evidence on the  

issue of one versus two orthographic lexicons. 

However, most evidence from normal and from 

brain-damaged individuals supports the assum 
p-
tion that there is a single orthographic lexicon. 

This makes sense given that it is presumably 

more efÞ cient for us to have only one ortho-

graphic lexicon.
spelling ability was much worse than their 

reading ability (unexpectedly poor spellers), 

suggesting that the processes involved in spelling 

and reading are different. They were compared 

to another group of students having comparable 

reading ability but better spelling. When both 

groups were given a more difÞ cult reading test 

(e.g., deciding whether ÒpilrgimÓ; ÒsenrtyÓ were 

words), the two groups did not differ. Thus, the 

discrepancy between the reading and spelling 

performance of the unexpectedly poor spellers 

was more apparent than real and disappeared 

when the complex reading task was used.

Speech as communication
†
The key to successful communication in a conversation involves use of the Co-operative
Principle. Common ground is easier to achieve when speakers and listeners interact with

each other
. SpeakersÕ failures to use the common ground seem to depend more on notions
of shared responsibility than on cognitive overload. According to the interactive alignment

model, speakers and listeners often achieve common ground fairly effortlessly by copying

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
 Planning of speech
† 
There has been controversy as to whether speech planning extends over a phrase or a 
clause. Forward planning is fairly extensive when speakers have relative freedom about 

what to say and when to say it. However, there is much less planning when the same 

sentence frame is used repeatedly or speakers are under time pressure.
 
Basic aspects of spoken language
† 
The demands on speech production are reduced by preformulation and underspeciÞ
 cation. 
The existence of syntactic priming suggests that speakers form syntactic representations 

separate from meaning and phonology. Discourse markers (commonly found in spontane-

ous speech) assist listenersÕ comprehension (e.g., by signalling shifts of topic). Speakers 

often use prosodic cues, but their use does not seem to indicate any particular responsive-

ness of speakers to the listener
.

They sug-

words to be used occurs earlier than the planning of the sounds 
to be spoken. Number-agreement errors are common when we are faced with conß
 icting 
information because avoiding them requires considerable processing resources.
 
Theories of speech production
† 
According to DellÕs spreading-activation theory, speech production involves semantic, 

syntactic, morphological, and phonological levels, with processing being parallel and inter-
active. The theory accounts for most speech errors, but predicts more errors than are 

actually found. The proportion of speech errors that are anticipatory is greater among 

individuals who make relatively few errors. WEA

 is a discrete, feed-forward model 
based on the assumption of serial processing. Neuroimaging evidence provides some sup-

port for the processing sequence assumed within the model. WEAVER
++
 cannot account 

for the extensive interactions involving words within a sentence or different processing 

levels for individual words.
 Cognitive neuropsychology: speech production
† 
There is a traditional distinction between BrocaÕs aphasia (slow, ungrammatical, and non-

ß
 uent speech) and W
ernickeÕs aphasia (ß uent speech often lacking meaning), but it is not 
clear-cut. Anomia seems to depend mainly on semantic and phonological impairments and 

may not involve problems with lemma selection. Patients with agrammatism produce sen-

tences 
lacking grammatical structure and with few function words, which supports the 
notion that there is a syntactic level of processing. Agrammatics seem to have reduced 

resources for syntactic processing, but the range of deÞ cits they show precludes any sweeping  

generalisations. The speech of jargon aphasics is reasonably grammatical. They produce 

many neologisms but are generally unaware of doing so. Their neologisms often include

FURTHER READING
50% to sentence generation, and 20% (or less) to revision. Good writers use a knowledge-

transforming rather than knowledge-telling strategy; this helps them to produce high-level 

main points. Good writers also spend more time revising than do other writers. Expert 

writers attain the knowledge-crafting stage in which the focus is on the readerÕs needs. 

Reviewing places more demands on the central executive component of working memory 

than planning or translating. The phonological loop and the visuo-spatial sketchpad are 

also involved in writing. Writing performance tends to be better when essays are word 

processed rather than written in longhand.
Spelling
†
It is generally assumed that there are separate lexical and non-lexical routes in spelling, with
the former being used to spell familiar words and the latter being used to spell unfamiliar

words and nonwords. Both routes make use of a graphemic buffer that brieß
 y holds
graphemic representations. Patients with phonological dysgraphia have damage to the

lexical route, whereas those with surface dysgraphia have damage to the non-lexical route.

However, there is some evidence that phonological dysgraphia involves a very general

impairment in phonological processing. The two routes often interact with each other.

The evidence suggests that a single orthographic lexicon is used in reading and spelling.

THINKING AND REASONING
Our ability to reß ect in a complex way on 
our lives, to plan and solve problems that arise 

on a daily basis, is the bedrock of thinking

They   range from solving puzzles in the newspaper   to troubleshooting (or not!) when our car breaks   down to developing a new theory of the universe.

However, as in all things human, 

the ways in which we think (and reason and 

make decisions) are many and varied. They 

range from solving puzzles in the newspaper 

to troubleshooting (or not!) when our car breaks 

down to developing a new theory of the universe. 

Below we consider a sample of the sorts of 

things to which we apply the term ÒthinkingÓ.
First, a fragment of Molly BloomÕs sleepy 
thoughts from James JoyceÕs 
Ulysses
 (1922 
/1960, 
pp. 871Ð 872), about Mrs Riordan:
God help the world if all women in the 

world were her sort down on bathingsuits 

and lownecks of course nobody wanted 

her to wear I suppose she was pious 

because no man would look at her twice 

I hope I™ll never be like her a wonder 

she didn™t want us to cover our faces but 
she was a well educated woman certainly 

and her gabby talk about Mr
. Riordan 
here and Mr. Riordan there I suppose he 

was glad to get shut of her.
Next, a person (S) answering an experimenterÕs 

(E) question about regulating the thermostat 

on a home-heating system (Kempton, 1986, 

p.83):
E: LetÕs say youÕre in the house and youÕre 
cold. 
. . . LetÕs say itÕs a cold day, you want 
to do something about it.
S: Oh, what I might do is, I might turn the 
thing up high to get out, to get a lot of 
air out fast, then after a little while turn 

it off or turn it down.
E: Uh-huh.

S: So, there also, you know, these issues 
about, um, the rate at which the thing 

produces heat, the higher the setting is, 

the more heat thatÕs produced per unit of 

time, so if youÕre cold, you want to get 

warm fast, um, so you turn it up high.
Finally, here is the Þ rst author trying to use 

PowerPoint:
Why has the Artwork put the title in the 

wrong part of the slide? Suppose I try to 

put a frame around it so I can drag it up 

to where I want it. Ah-ha, now if I just 

summon up the arrows I can move the 

top bit up, and then I do the same with 

the bottom bit. If I move the bottom bit 

up more than "
Segment_812,"the top bit, then the title   will ˚ t in okay. These three samples illustrate several gen- eral aspects of thinking.

than the processes themselves (see Chapter 16).
 
Furthermore, even when we can introspect 

on our thoughts, our recollections of them are 

often inaccurate. Joyce reconstructs well the

are typically 
involved in most problem-solving 
and reasoning 
tasks (see Chapter 14).
We will brieß y describe the structure of this 
section of the book. Chapter 12 is concerned 

primarily with the processes involved in problem 

solving. We include research concentrating on 

the role of learning in problem solving, with 

a particular emphasis on the knowledge and 

skills possessed by experts.
Chapter 13 deals with the important topics 
of judgement and decision making. Among the 

questions posed (and answered!) in this chapter 

are the following: What are the main factors 

inß
 uencing our decisions? Why do we some-
times ignore relevant information? What kinds 

of biases impair our judgement and our decision 

making? A central theme is that we use heuristics, 

or rules of thumb, that are simple to use but 

prone to error.
Chapter 14 deals mainly with deductive 
reasoning but with some coverage of inductive 

reasoning. We discuss major theories of reason-

ing, and also address broader issues that span 

the three chapters in this section. First, we 

consider the extent to which the same brain areas 

are involved in various forms of higher-level 

cognition. Second, we discuss the key question, 

ÒAre humans rational?Ó As you might expect 

from psychologists, the answer is, ÒYes and "
Segment_813,"noÓ, rather than a deÞ nite ÒYesÓ or ÒNoÓ! character of idle, associative thought in Molly   BloomÕs internal monologue.

character of idle, associative thought in Molly 

BloomÕs internal monologue. However, if we 

asked her to tell us her thoughts from the 

previous Þ ve minutes, little of it would be 

recalled.
Second, thinking varies in the extent to 
which it is directed. It can be relatively un-

directed, as in the case of Molly Bloom letting 

one thought slide into another as she is on the 

point of slipping into a dream. In the other 

two cases, the goal is much clearer and more 

well-deÞ ned.
Third, the amount and nature of the know-
ledge used in different thinking tasks varies 

enormously. For example, the knowledge required 

in the PowerPoint case is quite limited, even 

though it took the author concerned a fair 

amount of time to acquire it. In contrast, Molly 

Bloom is using a vast amount of her knowledge  

of people and of life.
The next three chapters (12Ð14) are con-
cerned with the higher-level cognitive processes 

involved in thinking and reasoning (see the Box 

below). Bear in mind that we use the 
same
 

cognitive system to deal with all these types of 

thinking. As a result, many distinctions among 

different 
forms of thinking and reasoning are 
rather arbitrary and camouß

similarities in

PROBLEM SOLVING AND EXPERTISE
cerned with the effects of learning than is most 
research on problem solving. In addition, the 

knowledge transferred from the past to the 

present extends beyond that directly relevant 

to problem solving.
The third topic is expertise. There are over-
laps between expertise and problem solving, 

in that experts are very efÞ cient at solving 

numerous problems in their area of expertise. 

However, there are also some important dif-

ferences. First, most traditional research on 

problem solving involved problems requiring 

no special training or knowledge for their 

solution. In contrast, studies on expertise have 

typically involved problems requiring consider-

able knowledge. Second, there is more focus on  

individual differences in research on expertise 

than in research on problem solving. Indeed, a 

central issue in expertise research is to identify 

the main differences (e.g., in knowledge; in strat-

egic processing) between experts and novices.
There is also overlap between the areas of 
transfer and expertise. One of the key reasons 

why experts perform at a much higher level than 

novices is because they can transfer or make 

use of their huge stock of relevant knowledge. 

What is of fundamental importance to both 

areas is an emphasis on understanding the 

processes involved in learning.
In sum, there are important similarities 
among the areas of problem solving, transfer, 

and expertise. For example, they all involve 

problems requiring individuals to generate their 

own options (possible answers), and then to 

use their ability and knowledge to select the

three examples here. First, you have an urgent 

meeting in another city and so must get there 

rapidly. However, the trains generally run late, 

your car is old and unreliable, and the buses 

are slow. Second, you are struggling to work 

out the correct sequence of operations on your 

computer to perform a given task. You try to 

remember what you needed to do with your 

previous computer. Third, you are an expert 

chess player in the middle of a competitive 

match against a strong opponent. The time 

clock is ticking away, and you have to decide 

on your move in a complicated position.
The above examples relate to the three main 
topics of this chapter. The Þ rst topic is problem 

solving, which Mayer (1990, p. 284) deÞ
 ned 
as Òcognitive processing directed at 
transforming 

a given situation into a goal 
situation when 

no obvious method of solution is available to 

the problem solver.Ó As we will see, most prob-

lems studied by psychologists 
are such that it 

is clear when the goal has 
been reached.
The second topic is transfer, which is con-
cerned with the beneÞ cial (or adverse) effects 

of previous learning and problem solving on 

some current task or problem. This is a very 

important topic (yes, it is!) because we constantly 

make use of past experience and knowledge to 

assist us in our current task. There is reasonable 

overlap between the areas of problem solving 

and transfer. However, transfer is more con-

best choice from those options. However, as 
we will see, there are also good reasons why 

rather separate bodies of theory and research 

have built up around each of the three areas.

(1) 
It involves controlled processes and is not 
(2) 
totally reliant on automatic processes.

A problem only exists when someone
 
(3) 
lacks the relevant knowledge to produce 

an immediate solution. Thus, a problem 

for most people (e.g., a mathematical 

calculation) may not be so for someone 

with relevant expertise (e.g., a professional
 
mathematician).
There is an important distinction between 
well-deÞ
 ned and ill-deÞ
 ned problems. 
Well-
deÞ ned problems
 are ones in which all aspects 

of the problem are clearly speciÞ
 ed: these 
include the initial state or situation, the range 

of possible moves or strategies, and the goal 

or solution. The goal is well-speciÞ
 ed, meaning 
it is clear when the goal has been reached. A maze 

is a well-deÞ ned problem in which escape from 

it (or reaching the centre, as in the Hampton 

Court maze) is the goal. Mind you, the Þ
 rst 
author has managed to get completely lost on 

the way out from the centre of the Hampton Court 

maze on more than one occasion! Chess can also  

be regarded as a well-deÞ ned problem, although 

obviously an extremely complex one. It is well-

deÞ
 ned in the sense that there is a standard 
initial state, the rules specify all legitimate rules, 

and the goal is to achieve checkmate.
In contrast, 
ill-deÞ
 ned problems
 are under-
speciÞ
 ed. Suppose you have locked your keys 
inside your car, and want to get into it without 

causing any damage. However, you have urgent 

business elsewhere, and there is no one around 

to help you. In such circumstances, it may be 

very hard to identify the best solution to the 

problem. For example, breaking a window will 

solve the immediate problem but will obviously 

create additional problems.
Most everyday problems are ill-deÞ
 ned 
problems. In contrast, psychologists have focused 

mainly on well-deÞ ned problems. Why is this? 

One important reason is that well-deÞ
 ned 
problems have an optimal strategy for th"

As a result, we can   identify the errors and deÞ ciencies in the strate-  gies  adopted by human problem  solvers.

There is a further distinction between

12 PROBLEM SOLVING AND EXPERTISE 
461
The Monty Hall problem
We can illustrate key issues in problem solving 
with the notorious Monty Hall problem. It is 

named after the host of an American television 

show, and is a well-deÞ ned and knowledge-lean 

problem:
Suppose you™re on a game show and you™re 

given the choice of three doors. Behind one 

door is a car, behind the others, goats. You 

pick a door, say, Number 1, and the host, 

who knows what™s behind the doors, opens

goat. He then says to you, ﬁDo you want to 

switch to door Number 2?ﬂ Is it to your 

advantage to switch your choice?
If you stayed with your Þ rst choice, you are 
in good company. About 85% of people make 
that decision (Burns &Wieth, 2004). Unfortunately, 

it is wrong!There is actually a two-thirds chance 

of being correct if you switch your choice.
Many people (including you?) furiously 
dispute this answer.We will use two ways to 

convince you that switching doubles your 

chances of winning the car. First, when you made 

your initial choice of picking one door out of 

three at random, you clearly only had a one-third 

chance of winning the car. Regardless of whether 

your initial choice was correct, the host can 

open a door that does not have the prize behind 

it.Thus, the hostÕs action sheds 
no light at all 
on

knowledge, because most of the necessary infor-
mation is given in the problem statement. Most  

traditional research on problem solving has 

involved the use of knowledge-lean problems. 

In contrast, research on expertise (discussed 

later) has typically involved knowledge-rich 

problems.
Gestalt approach
The American psychologist Thorndike (1898) 

carried out early research on problem solving. 

Hungry cats in closed cages could see a dish 

of food outside the cage. The cage doors opened 

when a pole inside the cage was hit. Initially, 

the cats thrashed about and clawed the sides 

of the cage. After some time, however, the cat 

hit the pole inside the cage and opened the 

door. On repeated trials, the cats gradually 

learned what was required. Eventually, they 

would hit the pole almost immediately and so 
gain access to the food. Thorndike was un-

impressed by the catsÕ performance, referring 

to their apparently almost random behaviour 

as 
trial-and-error learning
.
The Gestaltists (German psychologists ß
 our-
ishing in the 1930s) objected to the fact that 

there was a purely arbitrary relationship between 

the catsÕ behaviour (hitting the pole) and the 

desired consequence (the opening of the cage 

door) in ThorndikeÕs research. A key difference 

between ThorndikeÕs approach and that of 

the Gestaltists is captured in the distinction 

between reproductive and productive thinking. 
Þ rst choice was correct, and you would win 

by refusing to switch. Thus, switching succeeds 

with two out of three scenarios (2 and 3) and 

fails with only scenario (1), thus producing a 

two-thirds chance that switching will succeed.
Why do people fail on this problem?We 
will focus on three reasons. First, many people 

use the number-"
Segment_820,"of-cases heuristic or rule of   thumb (ÒIf the number of alternatives is N, then   the probability of each one is 1/NÓ) (Shimojo   & Ichikawa, 1989). Second, De Neys and   Verschueren (2006) argued that the Monty   Hall pr oblem places substantial demands on the  central executive, an attention-like",Explores how attention influences cognition.,"memory, attention, recognition",Nested under Chapter on recognition,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in recognition,Aligned with contemporary studies on emotion,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_1118,"of-cases heuristic or rule of 

thumb (ÒIf the number of alternatives is N, then 

the probability of each one is 1/NÓ) (Shimojo 

& Ichikawa, 1989). Second, De Neys and 

Verschueren (2006) argued that the Monty 

Hall pr
oblem places substantial demands on the 
central executive, an attention-like component 

of working memory (see Chapter 6).There 

were 22% correct responses on the problem 

when presented on its own but only 8% when 

participants had to perform a demanding task 

at the same time.
Third, Burns andWieth (2004) argued that 
the central problem is that people make errors 

when thinking about 
causality
 Ð the hostÕs actions 
may seem random but are actually not so. 
Accordingly, they made the problemÕs causal 

structure clearer. In their version, there are 

three boxers, one of whom is so good he is 

certain to win any bout. You select one boxer 

and then the other two boxers Þ
 ght each other. 
The winner of the Þ rst Þ ght then Þ ghts the 

boxer initially selected, and you win if you 

choose the winner of this second bout. You 

decide whether to stay with your initial choice or  

switch to the winner of the Þ rst bout. Fifty-one 

per cent of the participants made the correct 

decision to switch compared to only 15% with 

the standard three-door version.This difference 

occurred because it is easy to see that the boxer 

who won the Þrst bout did so because of skill 

rather than random factors.
In sum, the Monty Hall problem shows 
our fallibility as problem solvers.We produce 

wrong answers because we use heuristics or 

rules of thumb, because our processing capa-

city is limited, and because we misrepresent 

problems (e.g., misunderstanding their causal 

structure).

 a type of learning 
in which the solution is reached by producing 

fairly random responses rather than by a 

process of thought.

12 PROBLEM SOLVING 
AND EXPERTISE 
463
Reproductive thinking
 involves the re-use of 
previous experiences, and was the focus of 

ThorndikeÕs research. In contrast, 
productive 

thinking
 involves a novel restructuring of the 

problem and is more complex than reproductive 

thinking.
Kıhler (1925) showed that animals can 
engage in productive problem solving. A caged 

ape called Sultan could only reach a banana 

outside the cage by joining two sticks together. 

The ape seemed lost at Þ rst. However, after 

Sultan had put two sticks together by accident, 

he rapidly joined the sticks together. According 

to Kıhler, the ape had shown 
insight
, which 

involves a sudden restructuring of a problem 

and is often accompanied by the Òah-ha experi-

enceÓ. However, Sultan had spent the early 

months of his life in the wild and so could have  

previously learned how sticks can be combined. 

Birch (1945) found that apes raised in captivity 

showed little evidence of the kind of insightful 

problem solving observed by Kıhler (1925). 

Thus, the apparent insight shown by Sultan 

may have been due to a slow learning process 

rather than a sudden ß ash of insight.
Maier (1931) used the Òpendulum problemÓ 
to study insight in humans. Participants were 
brought into a room containing various objects 

(e.g., poles, pliers, extension cords), plus two 

strings hanging from the ceiling (see Figure 12.2).  

The task was to tie together the two strings, 

but they were too far apart for the participants 

to reach one string while holding the other. 

The most ÒinsightfulÓ (but rare) solution was 

to tie the pliers to one of the strings and then 

to swing the string like a pendulum. In this 

way, it was possible to hold one string and to 

catch the other on its upswing.
Maier found that insight and problem solu-
tion could be facilitated by having the experi-

menter apparently accidentally brush against 

the string to set it swinging. Maier claimed "

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
the participants were not consciously aware of 
being inß uenced by the experimenterÕs action. 

However, there is evidence for a 
conscious
 cue 

effect. Battersby, Teuber, and Bender (1953) found 

that the experimenter could greatly speed up 

solution times on the pendulum problem by 

highlighting 
objects that might be relevant to 
the problem.
Does insight exist?
The Gestaltists did not provide convincing 

evidence that insight really exists. Subsequent 

research, however, has Þ lled that gap. One 

approach is based on introspective evidence. 

For example, Metcalfe and Weibe (1987) recorded 

participantsÕ feelings of ÒwarmthÓ (closeness 

to solution) while engaged in problems assumed  

to involve or not to involve insight. Warmth 

increased progressively during non-insight prob-

lems, 
as expected if they involve a sequence of 

processes. With insight problems, in contrast, 

the warmth ratings remained at the same low 

level until suddenly increasing dramatically just 

before the solution was reached.
It is somewhat misleading to categorise 
problems as involving or not involving insight 

because any given problem can be solved in vari-

ous 
ways. For example, Bowden, Jung
-Beeman, 
Fleck, and Kounios (2005) used Compound 

Remote Associate problems. On each problem,  

three words were presented (e.g., ÒfenceÓ, ÒcardÓ, 

and ÒmasterÓ), and par"
Segment_823,"ticipants had to think of    a word (e.g., ÒpostÓ) that would go with each of    them to form a compound word. The partici-  pants indicated that insight (i.e., the answer   suddenly popped into their mind) was involved   on some trials but not on others. In one experiment, Bowden et al. (2005)  use",Explores how recognition influences cognition.,"perception, attention, memory",Nested under Chapter on perception,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in memory,Aligned with contemporary studies on memory,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_1194,"ticipants had to think of  

a word (e.g., ÒpostÓ) that would go with each of  

them to form a compound word. The partici-

pants indicated that insight (i.e., the answer 

suddenly popped into their mind) was involved 

on some trials but not on others.
In one experiment, Bowden et al. (2005) 
used fMRI. Differences in brain activity between 

insight and non-insight trials centred on the 

right hemisphere. More speciÞ cally, the anter-

ior superior temporal gyrus (ridge) in the right 

hemisphere (see Figure 12.3) was activated only 

when solutions involved insight. This is a brain 

area involved in processing distant semantic 

relations between words and more speciÞ
 cally 
in re-interpretation and semantic integration. 
In a second experiment, Bowden et al. recorded 

event-related potentials (ERPs; see Glossary). 

There was a burst of high-frequency brain activity 

one-third of a second before participants indi-

cated that they had achieved an insightful 

solution. This brain activity was centred on 

the right anterior superior temporal gyrus.
Bowden and Beeman (1998) had previously 
found that the right hemisphere plays an impor-

tant role in insight. 
Participants were presented 

with problems similar to those found on the 

Remote Associates Test. Before solving each 

problem, they were shown the solution word 

or an unrelated word and decided whether the 

word provided the solution. The word was 

presented to the left or the right hemisphere. 

Participants responded much faster when the 

word (solution or unrelated) was presented to 

the right hemisphere.
Why is the right hemisphere more associ-
ated with insight than the left hemisphere? 

According to Bowden and Jung-Beeman (2007), 

integration of weakly active and distant asso-

ciations occurs mostly in the right hemisphere. 

Thus, for example, connecting weakly related 

sentences occurs mainly in the right-hemisphere 

temporal areas (e.g., Mason & Just, 2004). These 

processing"
Segment_824,"activities are very relevant for pro-  ducing insight. In contrast, strong activation   of closely connected associations occurs mostly   in the left hemisphere.

Insight involves replacing one way of 
thinking about a problem with a new and more 

efÞ
 cient way. This implies that cognitive con-
ß
 ict is involved, and there is much evidence 
that the anterior cingulate cortex is activated 

during the processing of cognitive conß
 ict. Jing 
Luo and his associates have carried out much 

relevant research (see Luo & Knoblich, 2007, 

for a review). Some of this research has involved 

the presentation of mystifying sentences (e.g., 

ÒThe haystack was important because the cloth 

rippedÓ) followed by a cue designed to produce 

insight (e.g., ÒparachuteÓ). Processing of this 

Òinsight cueÓ was associated with increased 

activity in the anterior cingulate cortex.

 verbal problems were presented. Problems

solved using insight were preceded by increased 
activity in medial frontal areas including the 

anterior cingulate cortex as well as temporal 

areas associated with semantic processing. These 

Þ
 ndings suggest preparation for engaging in 
conß
 ict resolution and for semantic processing. 
In contrast, problems solved without the use 

of insight were preceded by increased activity 

in the occipital area, suggestive of an increase 

in visual attention.
One criterion for insight is that it occurs 
suddenly and unexpectedly and is consistent 

with our subjective experience. Novick and 

Sherman (2003) addressed the crucial issue of 

whether what is true of our subjective experi-

ence is also true of the underlying process. 

Anagrams and non-anagrams were presented 

very brieß y (469 or 953 ms), after which the 
participants (expert and non-expert anagram

What can we conclude from Novick and 
ShermanÕs (2003) research? Much 
relevant
 
processing apparently occurs before insight 

anagram solutions, as is shown by the above-

chance performance. However, people have 

no conscious awareness of such processing. 

How, then, can we account for the fact that 

insight solutions differ from non-insightful 

solutions in speed and subjective experience? 

Perhaps 
insight solutions are based on parallel 
processing 
(several processes occurring at the 
same time), whereas non-insightful solutions

In sum, there is reasonable (but not over-
whelming) evidence to suggest that insight does 

exist. Subjective report, behavioural evidence, 

and neuroimaging evidence all support a dis-

tinction between problem solutions based on 

insight and those based on more deliberate 

thought processes. The mechanisms underlying

Past experience
Past experience generally increases our ability 

to solve problems. However, Duncker (1945) 

argued that this is not always the case. He 

studied functional Þ xedness, in which we fail 

to solve problems because we assume from past 

experience that any given object has only a limited 

number of uses. Note in passing that MaierÕs 

(1931) pendulum problem involves functional 

Þ
 xedness Ð participants failed to realise that 
pliers can be used as a pendulum weight.
Duncker gave his participants a candle, a 
box of nails, and several other objects. Their 

task was to attach the candle to a wall next to 

a table so it did not drip onto the table below. 

Most participants tried to nail the candle 

directly to the wall or to glue it to the wall by 

melting it. Only a few decided to use the inside 

of the nail-box as a candle holder, and to nail 

it to the wall. Duncker argued that the parti-

cipants ÒÞ xatedÓ on the boxÕs function rather 

than its use as a platform. More correct solutions 

were produced when the nail-box was empty 

at the start of the experiment, presumably 

because that situation made the box appear 

less like a container.
Duncker (1945) argued that functional 
Þ
 xedness occurred in his study because of his 
participantsÕ past experience with boxes. Using 

that argument, German and Defeyter (2000) 

suggested that young children with very limited 

past experience with boxes might be immune 

to functional Þ xedness. They used a set-up 

similar to that of Duncker with Þve, six, and 
seven year olds initially shown a box functioning 

or not functioning as a container. After that, 

the time taken to use the box as a support was 

measured. There were two key Þ
 ndings (see 
Figure 12.4). First, only the performance of the 

Þ
 ve year olds was unaffected by having previ-
ously been shown the box used as a container.

Luchins (1942) and Luchins and Luchins

They used water-jar problems involving three 

water jars of varying capacity. The task was to 

imagine pouring water from one jar to another 

to Þ nish up with a speciÞ ed amount in one of 

the jars. Here is a sample problem: Jar A can 

hold 28 quarts of water, Jar B 76 quarts, and 

Jar C 3 quarts. You must end up with exactly 

25 quarts in one of the jars. The solution is 

not hard: Jar A is Þ lled, and then Jar C is Þ
 lled 
from it, leaving 25 quarts in Jar A. Of parti-

cipants who had previously been given similar 

problems, 95% solved it. Other participants

managed to solve this comparatively easy 

problem!
What do the above Þ ndings mean? Luchins 
(1942) emphasised the notion of 
Einstellung
 or 

mental set. The basic idea is that people tend to  

use a well-practised strategy on problems even 

when it is inappropriate or sub-optimal. In the 

words of Luchins (p. 15), ÒOne . . . is led by a 

mechanical application of a used method.Ó

the Gestalt approach into his representa-

tional change theory based on the following 

assumptions:
The way in which a problem is currently
¥
represented or structured in the problem

solverÕs mind serves as a memory probe to

retrieve related knowledge from long-term

memory (e.g., operators or possible actions).

The retrieval process is based on spreading
¥
activation among concepts or items of know-

ledge in long-term memory.

An impasse or block occurs when the way
¥
a problem is represented does not permit

retrieval of the necessary operators or

possible actions.

The impasse is broken when the problem
¥
representation is changed. The new mental

representation acts as a memory probe for

relevant operators in long-term memory.

Thus, it extends the information available

to the problem solver.

Changing the problem representation can
¥
occur in various ways:
Ð
Elaboration or addition of new problem

information.
Ð Constraint relaxation, in which inhibi-
tions on what is regarded as permissible

are removed.
Ð
Re-encoding, in which some aspect

of the problem representation is re-

interpreted (e.g., a pair of pliers is re-

interpreted as a weight in the pendulum

problem).
Insight occurs when an impasse is broken,
¥
and the retrieved knowledge operators are

sufÞ
 cient to solve the problem.
OhlssonÕ
s theory is based squarely on Gestalt
theory
. Changing the problem representation 
in OhlssonÕs theory is very similar to restruc-

turing in the Gestalt approach, and both theories 

emphasise the role of insight in producing 

problem solution. The main difference is that 

Ohlsson speciÞed in more detail the processes 

leading to insight.
Evidence
Changing the problem representation often leads 

to solution. Consider the mutilated draught-

758,148 possible permutations of the dominoes! 
What is needed is to represent each domino as 

an object covering one white and one black 

square (re-encoding) and to represent the 

draughtboard as having lost two black (or two 

white) squares (elaboration). It then becomes 

clear that the 31 dominoes cannot cover the 

mutilated board.
Knoblich, Ohlsson, Haider, and Rhenius 
(1999) showed the importance of constraints 

in reducing the likelihood of insight. Participants 

were given problems such as those shown in 

Figure 12.6. As you can see, you would need 

to know all about Roman numerals to solve 

the problems! The task involved moving a 

single
 stick to produce a true statement in place 

of the initial false one. 
Some problems (Type A) 

only required changing 
two of the values in the 
equation (e.g., VI 
=
 VII 
+
 I becomes VII 
=
 VI 
+
 I).  
In contrast, other problems (Type B) involved 

a less obvious change in the representation 

of the equation (e.g., IV 
=
 III 
−
 I becomes 

IV 
−
 III 
=
 I).
Knoblich et al. argued that our experience 
of arithmetic tells us that many operations 

change the values (numbers) in an equation (as 

is the case with Type A problems). In contrast, 

relatively few operations change the operators 

(i.e., 
+
, 
−
, and 
=
 signs) as is required in Type

As predicted, it was much harder   for participants to relax the normal constraints   of arithmetic (and thus to show insight) for  Type B problems than for Type A ones (see   Figure 12.6).

As predicted, it was much harder 

for participants to relax the normal constraints 

of arithmetic (and thus to show insight) for 
Type B problems than for Type A ones (see 

Figure 12.6).
Knoblich et al.Õs (1999) study does not 
provide
 direct
 evidence about the underlying 

processes causing difÞ culties with Type B 

problems. Accordingly, Knoblich et al. (2001) 

recorded eye movements while participants 

were solving matchstick arithmetic problems. 

Participants initially spent much more time 

Þ
 xating the values than the operators for 
both types of problem. Thus, participantsÕ initial 

representation was based on the assumption 

that values rather than operators needed to 

be changed.
Reverberi, Toraldo, DÕAgostini, and Skrap 
(2005) argued that the lateral frontal cortex 

is the part of the brain involved in imposing 

constraints on individualsÕ processing when 

confronted by an insight problem. It follows 

that patients with damage to that brain area 

would 
not
 impose artiÞ cial constraints and so 
might perform better than healthy controls. 

That is exactly what they found. Brain-damaged 

patients solved 82% of the most difÞ
 cult match-
stick arithmetic problems compared to only 

43% of healthy controls.
Evaluation
OhlssonÕs view that changing the problem 

representation (the GestaltistsÕ restructuring) 

often allows people to solve problems is correct.

in solving insight problems, as was"
Segment_831,"shown most  dramatically by Reverberi et al. (2005). OhlssonÕs   theory is an improvement on the Gestalt   approach because the mechanisms underlying   insight are speciÞ ed more precisely.

dramatically by Reverberi et al. (2005). OhlssonÕs 

theory is an improvement on the Gestalt 

approach because the mechanisms underlying 

insight are speciÞ ed more precisely. In general 

terms, the theory involves a fruitful combination 

of Gestalt ideas with the information-processing  

approach.
What are the limitations of representa-
tional change theory? First, it is often not 

possible to predict when (or in what way) the 

representation of a problem will change. 

Second, the theory is basically a single-factor 

theory, in that it is assumed that constraint 

relaxation is crucial to successful solution of 

insight problems. However, Kershaw and Ohlsson 

(2004) found with the nine-dot problem (see 

Figure 12.7) that multiple factors were involved, 

and that hints to produce constraint relaxation 

had only a modestly beneÞ cial effect. Third, 

Ohlsson de-emphasised important individual 

differences in problem-solving skills (e.g., those 

based on IQ differences).
Incubation
The emphasis within representational change 

theory is on factors that permit people to over-

come a block or impasse in problem solving. 

Wallas (1926) suggested that one important 

factor was 
incubation
, in which a problem 

is solved more easily by simply ignoring it 

for some time. His basic idea was that the sub-

conscious mind continues to work towards 

a solution while the conscious mind focuses 

on other activities. Research on incubation has 
often involved comparing an experimental 

group having an incubation period away from 

an unsolved problem with a control group 

working continuously.
Sio and Ormerod (2009) carried out a 
meta-analysis of 117 studies on incubation, 

and reported three main Þ ndings. First, there 

was a fairly small but highly signiÞ
 cant overall 
incubation effect, with positive effects being 

reported in 85 of the studies. Second, there 

was a stronger incubation effect with creative 

problems having multiple s"
Segment_832,"olutions than with   linguistic and verbal problems having a single   solution. Incubation often leads to a widening   of the search for knowledge, and this may well   be more useful with multiple-solution problems   than with single-solution ones. Third, the effects   were greater when there was a",Explores how emotion influences cognition.,"perception, recognition, memory",Nested under Chapter on emotion,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in awareness,Aligned with contemporary studies on perception,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_688,"olutions than with 

linguistic and verbal problems having a single 

solution. Incubation often leads to a widening 

of the search for knowledge, and this may well 

be more useful with multiple-solution problems 

than with single-solution ones. Third, the effects 

were greater when there was a relatively long 

preparation time prior to incubation. This may  

have occurred because an impasse or block in 

thinking is more likely to develop when the 

preparation time is long.
It is often claimed that Òsleeping on a prob-
lemÓ can be a very effective form of incubation. 

For example, the dreams of August Kekul” led to  

the discovery of a simple structure for benzene. 

Wagner, Gais, Haider, Verleger, and Born (2004) 

tested the value of sleep in a study in which 

participants performed a complex mathematical 

task and were then re-tested several hours later. 

The mathematical problems were designed so 

that they could be solved in a much simpler way 

than the one used initially by nearly all the 

participants. Of those who slept between training 

and testing, 59% found the short cut, compared 

to only 25% of those who did not.
How can we explain incubation effects? 
As we have seen, Wallas (1926) argued that 

subconscious processes were responsible. In 

contrast, Simon (1966) argued that incubation 

involves a special type of forgetting. More

 cally, what tends to be forgotten over time

is control information relating to the strategies 
tried by the problem solver. This forgetting 

makes it easier for problem solvers to adopt 

a new approach to the problem after the 

incubation period.
Support for SimonÕs ("

the Remote Associates Test (e.g., Þ
 nding a

Ó that links

). 
In the crucial interference condition, associated 

clue words were presented that emphasised 

the 
differences
 in meanings of the three words 
(
water
 was paired with 
tank
, 
ant
 with 
hill
, and
 
hideout
 with secret). There was also a control 

condition with no misleading clue words. 

Participants solved the anagrams with or with-

out a Þ ve-minute break to play a video game 

in the middle to permit incubation. Participants 

in the interference condition given an incubation 

period solved 67% of the problems compared 

to only 54% in the interference condition. In 

contrast, there was no incubation effect at all 

in the control condition without the misleading 

associates. Thus, there was an incubation effect 

only when the break allowed misleading infor-

mation to be forgotten.
General Problem Solver
Allen Newell and Herb Simon (1972) argued 

that it is possible to produce systematic com-

puter simulations of human problem solving. 

They achieved this with their General Problem 

Solver, a computer program designed to solve 

numerous well-deÞ ned problems. Newell and 

SimonÕs starting assumptions were that infor-

mation processing is serial (one process at a 

time), that people possess limited short-term 

memory capacity, and that they can retrieve 

relevant information from long-term memory.
Newell and Simon (1972) started by asking 
people to solve problems while thinking aloud. 

They then used these verbal reports to decide 

what general strategy was used on each problem. 

Finally, they speciÞ ed the problem-solving 

strategy in sufÞ cient detail for it to be pro-

grammed as a 
problem space
. This problem space 

consists of the initial stage of the problem, the 
goal state, all of the possible mental operators 

(e.g., moves) that can be applied to any state 
"
Segment_834,"to change it into a different state, and all of   the intermediate states of the problem. The above notions can be illustrated by  considering the Tower of Hanoi problem (see   Figure 12.8). The initial state of the problem   consists of up to Þ ve discs piled in decreasing   size on the Þ rst of t",Explores how emotion influences cognition.,"recognition, emotion, attention",Nested under Chapter on emotion,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in memory,Aligned with contemporary studies on memory,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_1030,"
to change it into a different state, and all of 

the intermediate states of the problem.
The above notions can be illustrated by 
considering the Tower of Hanoi problem (see 

Figure 12.8). The initial state of the problem 

consists of up to Þ ve discs piled in decreasing 

size on the Þ rst of three pegs. When all the 

discs are piled in the same order on the last 

peg, the goal state has been reached. The rules 

state that only one disc can be moved at a time, 

and a larger disc cannot be placed on top of 

a smaller disc.
How do problem solvers cope with their 
limited processing capacities? According to 

Newell and Simon (1972), the complexity of 

most problems means that we rely heavily on 

heuristics or rules of thumb. 
Heuristics
 can be 

contrasted with 
algorithms,
 which are generally 
complex methods or procedures guaranteed to 

lead to problem solution. The most important 

of the various heuristic methods is 
meansÐends 

analysis

largest disc on the last peg. If a situation arises 

in which the largest disc must be placed on 

either the middle or the last peg, then meansÐ

ends analysis will lead to that disc being placed 

on the last peg.
Another important heuristic is hill climbing. 
Hill climbing
 involves changing the present 

state within the problem into one closer to 

the goal or problem solution, in the same way 

that someone climbing a hill feels he/she is 

making progress if they keep moving upwards. 

As Robertson (2001, p. 38) pointed out, ÒHill 

climbing is a metaphor for problem solving 

in the dark.Ó Thus, hill climbing is a simpler 

heuristic than meansÐends analysis.
Newell and Simon (1972) applied the 
General Problem Solver to 11 rather different 

problems (e.g., letter-series completions; mis-

sionaries and cannibals; the Tower of Hanoi). 

The General Problem Solver managed to solve 

all the problems, but it did not do so in the 

same way as people.
Evidence
Thomas (1974) argued that people should 

experience difÞ culties in solving a problem at 

those points at which it is necessary to make 

a move that temporarily 
increases
 the distance 

between the current state and the goal state. 

In other words, problem solvers should struggle 

when heuristics are inadequate. He used a variant 

of the missionaries and cannibals problem based 

on hobbits and orcs. In the standard version, 

three missionaries and three cannibals need to 
be transported across a river in a boat that can 

hold only two people. The number of cannibals 

can never exceed the number of missionaries, 

because then the cannibals would eat the mis-

sionaries. One move involves transferring one 

cannibal and one missio"

the goal or solution, and so is inconsistent with 

the hill-climbing heuristic. As predicted, it was 

at this point that participants experienced severe  

difÞ
 culties. However, General Problem Solver 
didnÕt Þ nd this move especially difÞ
 cult.
Thomas (1974) also obtained evidence that 
participants set up subgoals. They would often 

perform a block of several moves at increasing 

speed, followed by a long pause before embark-

ing on another rapid sequence of moves. This 

suggested that participants were dividing up 

the problem into three or four major subgoals.
According to the theory, people generally 
make extensive use of meansÐends analysis. 

Dramatic evidence that people sometimes per-

sist with that heuristic even when it severely 

impairs performance was reported by Sweller 

and Levine (1982). Participants were given 

the maze shown in Figure 12.9, but most of it 

wasnÕt visible to them. All participants could 

see the current problem state (where they were 

in the problem). Some could also see the goal 

state (goal-information group), whereas the 

others could not (no-goal-information group).
What do you think happened on this 
relatively simple problem (simple because its 

solution only involved alternating left and right 

moves)? Use of meansÐends analysis requires 

knowledge of the location of the goal, so only 

the goal-information group could have used 

that heuristic. However, the problem was 

designed so that meansÐends analysis would 

not be useful, because every move involved 

turning 
away
 from the goal. As predicted, 
hill climbing:
 a 
heuristic
 involving changing 
the present state of a problem into one 

apparently closer to the goal.

Why do most people engage in only a 
modest amount of planning when engaged 

in problem solving? According to Newell and 

Simon (1972), the main problem is our limited 

short-term memory capacity. However, another 

possibility is that planning incurs costs in terms 

of time and effort, and is often unnecessary 

because simple heuristics suffice. Evidence 

favouring the latter possibility was reported 

by Delaney, Ericsson, and Knowles (2004) 

using water-jar problems in which the task was 

to Þ
 nish up with speciÞ
 ed amounts of water in 
each of three water jars. Half the participants 

were instructed to generate the complete solu-

tion before making any moves, whereas the 

other half (control group) were free to adopt 

whatever strategy they wanted.
Delaney et al. (2004) found the control 
participants showed little evidence of planning. 

However, the key Þ nding was that those in the 

planning group showed very clear evidence of 

being able to plan, and they solved the problem 

in far fewer moves than the control participants. 

Thus, we have a greater ability to plan than is 
usually assumed, but often choose not to plan 

unless required to do so.
Newell and Simon (1972) assumed that 
people would shift strategies or heuristics if 

the ones they were using proved ineffective. 

This idea was developed by MacGregor, 

Ormerod, and Chronicle (2001). They argued 

that people use a heuristic known as 
progress 

monitoring
: the rate of progress towards a goal 

is assessed, and criterion failure occurs if progress 

is too slow to solve the problem within the 

maximum number of moves. The basic idea is 

that criterion failure acts as a Òwake-up callÓ, 

leading people to change strategy.
MacGregor et al. (2001) obtained evidence 
of progress monitoring in a study"
Segment_838,"on the nine-dot   problem (see Figure 12.10(a)). In this problem,   you must draw four straight lines connecting   all nine dots without taking your pen off the   paper.

problem (see Figure 12.10(a)). In this problem, 

you must draw four straight lines connecting 

all nine dots without taking your pen off the 

paper. The solution is shown in Figure 12.10(b).  

One reason why many people fail to solve this 

problem is because they mistakenly assume 

the lines must stay within the square. The key 

conditions used by MacGregor et al. (2001) 

are shown in Figure 12.10(c) and (d). We might 

expect participants given (c) to perform better 

than those given (d) because it is clearer in (c) 

that the lines must go outside the square. In 

contrast, MacGregor et al. argued that indi-

viduals given Figure 12.10(c) can cover more 

dots with the next two lines than those given 

Figure 12.10(d) while remaining within the 

square. As a result, they are less likely to expe-

rience criterion failure, and so will be less likely 

to shift to a superior strategy.
The Þ ndings supported the prediction. 
Only 31% of those given Figure 12.10(c) 

solved the nine-dot problem compared to 53% 

of those given Figure 12.10(d). The take-home

cannot allow you to solve the problem, the 
sooner you realise that is the case the better.
Evaluation
The Newell and Simon approach works reason-

ably well with many well-deÞ ned problems. Their 

theoretical approach also has the advantage 

that it allows us to specify the shortest sequence 

of moves from the initial state to the goal state.

is broadly consistent with our knowledge of 

human information processing. For example, 

we have limited working memory capacity (see 

Chapter 6), which helps to explain why we use 

heuristics or rules of thumb such as meansÐ

ends analysis and hill climbing.
What are the limitations of Newell and 
SimonÕs approach? First, the General Problem 

Solver is better than humans at remembering 

what has happened on a problem, but it is 

inferior to humans at planning future moves. 

It focuses on only a single move, whereas hu-

mans 
can plan several moves ahead. Second, 
most problems in everyday life are ill-deÞ
 ned 
and so differ considerably from those studied 

by Newell and Simon. Third, the theoretical ap-

proach is best suited to multiple-move problems 

requiring serial processing (e.g., missionaries-

and-cannibals problem). It is less able to 

account for performance on insight problems. 

Fourth, Newell and Simon de-emphasised 

individual differences in strategy and speed of 

problem solving. Handley, Capon, Copp, and 

Harper (2002) found that individual differ-

ences in spatial working memory capacity (see 

Chapter 6) predicted performance on the Tower 

of Hanoi task, but this is not predicted by 

General Problem Solver.
Problem solving: brain systems
Several studies have indicated that the frontal 

cortex is heavily involved in problem solving. 

We will start by considering the evidence from 

brain-damaged patients and then move on to 

neuroimaging studies on healthy individuals. 

Owen, Downes, Sahakian, Polkey, and Robbins 

(1990) used a computerised version of the Tower 

of London problem resembling the Tower of 

Hanoi problem. Patients with left frontal dam-

age, right frontal damage, and healthy controls

advantage compared to the

the patients performed worse because they 
found it harder to make moves in conß
 ict with 
the strategy. Patients with damage to the left 

dorsolateral prefrontal cortex performed worse 

than those with right damage. Why was this? 

According to Colvin et al. (p. 1129), ÒPatients 

with left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex lesions 

have difÞ culty making a decision requiring the 

conceptual comparison of non-verbal stimuli, 

manipulation of select representations of poten-

tial solutions, and are unable to appropriately 

inhibit a response in keeping with the Þ
 nal 
goal.Ó

participants performed the Tower of London 

task in various versions varying in complexity. 

The more complex versions of the task were 

associated with increased 
activity in several brain 

areas compared to 
simpler 
versions. Of particular 
note, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was more 

active when participants were engaged in solving 

complex versions of the Tower of London task.
Fincham, Carter, van Veen, Stenger, and 
Anderson (2002) used a modiÞ ed version of the 

Tower of Hanoi problem. Engaging in problem 

solving was associated with activation in several 

brain regions, including the right dorsolateral 

prefrontal cortex, bilateral parietal cortex, and 

bilateral premotor cortex. These areas are associ-

ated with use of the working memory system 

and attentional processes (see Chapter 6).
Unterrainer et al. (2004) considered brain 
activity while strong and weak problem solvers 

attempted several Tower of London problems. 

There were two main Þ ndings. First, the right 

dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was highly 

activated during strategy planning and per-

formance execution. Second, performance on 

the Tower of London problems was positively 

associated with the extent of activity in the 

right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, especially 

BA9. It is worth noting that Burgess et al. 

(2000) found that frontal lobe patients with 

damage in the right dorsolateral prefrontal 

cortex found it harder than those with left 
damage to generate plans in a multi-tasking 

experiment.
In sum, several interesting Þ
 ndings have 
emerged from research in this area. First, the 

frontal lobes (especially the dorsolateral pre-

frontal cortex) are more consistently activated 

than other parts of the brain during problem 

solving. Second, research on brain-damaged 

patients also indicates the importance of the 

frontal lobes in problem solving. More speciÞ
 -

Third, the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex   seems to be more important than the left dorso-  lateral prefrontal cortex with the Tower of   London or Tower of Hanoi problems, whereas   the opposite is the case with water-jar problems.

Third, the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex 

seems to be more important than the left dorso-

lateral prefrontal cortex with the Tower of 

London or Tower of Hanoi problems, whereas 

the opposite is the case with water-jar problems.
What are the psychological implications of 
the above Þ ndings? First, the involvement of 

the prefrontal cortex suggests that problem 

solvers engage in complex cognitive processing 

and do not totally rely on simple heuristics. 

However, some heuristics may involve the 

prefrontal cortex. Second, the Þ
 nding that the 
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is activated in 

different forms of problem solving suggests that 

they may involve common cognitive processes. 

Third, patients with prefrontal damage experi-

ence particular difÞ culties when a simple heuristic 

proves inadequate because they Þ nd it hard 

to inhibit dominant responses. Evidence that 

response inhibition is important for successful 

performance on the Tower of London problem 

was reported by Asato, Sweeney, and Luna (2006). 

Improvements in performance on this problem 

during adolescence were strongly associated 

with improved performance on the antisaccade 

task. This task involves inhibiting an eye move-

ment or saccade to a cue and instead making 

an eye movement in the opposite direction.
Adaptive control of thought Ð

inß
 uential theoretical approach known as the 
adaptive control of thought Ð rational (ACR-R) 

theory (also discussed in Chapter 1). ACT-R

Earlier versions of ACT-R emerged from 
within computational cognitive science, and so 

consisted of complex computational models. 

More recent versions have combined com-

putational cognitive science with cognitive 

neuroscience. Here are the major assumptions 

of ACT-R:
The cognitive system consists of seven
¥
modules. Each module performs its own

specialised operations fairly independently

of the other modules.

Four of the modules are of particular
¥
importance to human cognition, including

problem solving (see Figure 12.11):

Œ Retrievalmodule
: it maintains the re-
trieval cues needed to access information.

Functional neuroimaging studies (e.g.,

Badre & W
agner, 2007) suggest it is
located in the inferior ventrolateral pre-

frontal cortex (VLPFC).
Œ Imaginalmodule
: it transforms problem
representations (e.g., a change to a
planned state in the Tower of Hanoi 

task). Functional neuroimaging studies 

suggest it is located in the posterior 

parietal cortex.
Œ Goal module
: it keeps track of an
individualÕs intentions and controls 

information processing. It is located in 

the anterior cingulate cortex.
Œ Procedural module
: it uses production
(IF . . . THEN) rules (see Chapter 1) to 

determine what action will be taken 

next. It is located at the head of caudate 

nucleus within the basal ganglia.
The brain regions corresponding to the
¥
four modules just described are generally 

all activated by complex cognitive tasks. 

However, it is assumed that each region 

responds to somewhat different factors.

Each module has a buffer associated with
¥
it containing a limited amount of informa-

tion. According to Anderson et al. (2004, 

p.1058), ÒA central production system can

detect patterns in these buffers and take 

co-ordinated action.Ó
There are two important features of func
tional 
neuroimaging research designed 
to test 
predic-
tions of ACT-R. First, the emphasis has been

one of the modules but not the others. Second, 
the same well-deÞ ned regions corresponding 

to the various modules are the focus of interest. 

This theory-driven approach is preferable to 

the blunderbuss approach of searching around 

for brain areas that are especially responsive 

to some manipulation.
Evidence
Anderson, Albert, and Fincham (2005) used 

fMRI with the Tower of Hanoi to address two 

main issues. First, they predicted that there 

would be least activity in the ventrolateral pre-

frontal cortex (retrieval module) when partici-

pants were producing sequences of moves that 

placed minimal demands on memory retrieval. 

That prediction was supported. Anderson et al. 

also predicted that there would be the greatest 

activation of the posterior parietal region 

(imaginal module) when planning on the Tower 

of Hanoi problem was most intense. That pre-

diction was also supported.
Qin et al. (2004) carried out a study in 
which children aged 11Ð14 spent one hour a 

day for six days learning to solve equations of 

varying levels of difÞ culty. All four brain regions 

identiÞ
 ed within ACT-R showed an effect of 
task complexity. However, there were two key 

Þ
 ndings. First, the area associated with the 
retrieval module (ventrolateral prefrontal cortex) 

showed almost no response in a task condition 

in which virtually nothing had to be retrieved. 

In contrast, the other three regions were a"
Segment_845,"ctivated   in that condition. Second, practice led to sub-  stantial reductions in activation in the brain   areas associated with the retrieval, imaginal,   and procedural modules. However, the anterior   cingulate (associated with the goal module)   showed practically no effect of practice. Theore",Explores how memory influences cognition.,"recognition, perception, attention",Nested under Chapter on attention,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in recognition,Aligned with contemporary studies on perception,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_1100,"ctivated 

in that condition. Second, practice led to sub-

stantial reductions in activation in the brain 

areas associated with the retrieval, imaginal, 

and procedural modules. However, the anterior 

cingulate (associated with the goal module) 

showed practically no effect of practice. Theoreti-

cally, this happened because the problem-solving  

strategy remained the same with practice.
Similar results with adults using a different 
task were reported by Fincham and Anderson 

(2006). Participants were given extensive practice 

in learning and applying rules associated with 

each of eight sports. At the end of practice, a 

change was introduced in the task to increase 

the demands on decision making. The Þ
 ndings 
were dramatic. Practice was associated with a 

substantial decrease in activation of the ventro-

lateral prefrontal cortex (retrieval module) 

because retrieval of relevant information became 

easier with practice. However, practice was 

associated with a signiÞ cant increase in activa-

tion of the anterior cingulate (goal module) 

because the change in the task introduced 

additional control demands.
Evaluation
ACT-R is an impressive theory in several ways. 

First, it is an ambitious attempt to provide a 

theoretical framework for understanding infor-

mation processing and performance on numerous  

very different cognitive tasks. Second, it rep-

resents the most thorough attempt to date to 

combine computational cognitive science with 

cognitive neuroscience. As such, it provides 

a theory-driven approach to functional neuro-

imaging research. Third, the fact that several 

brain regions all 
tend to be activated during the  
performance of a complex cognitive task makes 

it hard to identify the speciÞ c functions served 

by any given region. The research generated 

by ACT-R has made progress in achieving this 

difÞ cult goal.
What are the limitations of ACT-R? First, 
it is assumed within the theory that only small 

ar"
Segment_846,"eas of prefrontal cortex are of crucial impor-  tance in human information processing. It seems   probable that several other areas play impor-  tant roles.

tance in human information processing. It seems 

probable that several other areas play impor-

tant roles. For example, we saw earlier that many 

studies have found evidence that dorsolateral 

prefrontal cortex is strongly involved in problem 

solving.
Second, the central ganglia are assumed to 
have major signiÞ cance in co-ordinating pro-

cessing within various cortical regions and in 

action selection. This minimises the numerous 

direct connections between different brain regions 

that have been found in functional neuroimaging 

studies.
Third, the various modules within the theory 
may not be as distinct as assumed. Danker and 

Anderson (2007) used a multi-step algebra task 

in which transformation was required initially, 

followed later by retrieval. It was predicted

that there would be initial activation of the 
posterior parietal cortex followed by activation 

of the inferior ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. 

In fact, both areas were activated at both stages, 

suggesting that it is hard to disentangle trans-

formation and retrieval processes in mathematical 

problem solving.
TRANSFER OF TRAINING 
AND ANALOGICAL 

REASONING
Suppose you have solved a given problem in 
the past, and are now confronted by a similar 

problem. You would probably assume your 

previous experience would allow you to solve 

the current problem faster and more easily than 

would otherwise have been the case. In the 

jargon of psychologists, this is 
positive
 
transfer
. 
However, solving a given problem in the past 

sometimes disrupts our ability to solve a similar  

current problem. This state of affairs is 
negative 
transfer
. We encountered examples of negative 

transfer earlier in studies on functional Þ
 xedness 
(e.g., Duncker, 1945; Luchins, 1942).

students learn at school and at university facili-

tates learning in their future lives. 
Far transfer
 

(positive transfer to a dissimilar context) is of 

special interest because of its direct relevance 

to everyday life. In fact, however, most research 

has focused on
 near
 
transfer
 (positive transfer 
to a similar context). In such research, the focus 

is on the immediate application of knowledge 

and skills from one situation to a similar one. 

This approach differs from most real-life situ-

ations in that participants on the transfer task 

are not permitted to make use of external sup-

port (e.g., texts, friends, feedback from others). 

Bransford and Schwartz (1999) argued that a 

preferable approach is preparation for future 

learning, in which the emphasis is on participantsÕ 

ability to learn in new, support-rich situations. 

Within this approach, learning is regarded as 
an active and constructive process, and the 

importance of 
metacognition
 (beliefs and know-
ledge about oneÕs own cognitive processes) is 

emphasised.
Chen and Klahr (2008) identiÞ
 ed three 
dimensions determining the transfer distance 

between a current problem and a relevant past 

problem:
Task similarity
(1) 
: similarities between the 
problems in superÞ 
cial (objects and their 
properties) and structural (i.e., underlying
 
relations) features.

Context similarity
(2) 
: similarities in physical 
context (location) and social context (e.g.,
 
people).

Time interval
(3) 
: the period of time between 
the past and present problems.
T
ransfer is generally greatest when two prob-
lems are similar, the contexts are similar
, and 
the time interval is short (see Chen & Klahr, 

2008, for a review).
In what follows, we will Þ rst consider far 
transfer. Dunbar (2001) identiÞ

on the factors (e.g., cognitive processes) increasing  
or decreasing near transfer.
Far transfer
Evidence of large far transfer effects was reported 

by Chen and Klahr (1999). Children aged 

between seven and ten years of age were trained 

to design and evaluate experiments in the domain 

of physical science. Of central importance in 

the childrenÕs learning was the control of 

variables strategy involving the ability to create 

sound experiments and to distinguish between 

confounded and unconfounded experiments.
Chen and Klahr carried out a test of far 
transfer seven months after training. This test 

assessed mastery of the control of variables 

strategy in Þ ve new domains, including plant 

growth, biscuit making, and drink sales. Chil-

dren who had received the previous training 

performed much better on the test than did 

control children who had not received training 

(see Figure 12.12).
Evidence of the importance of task similarity 
for far transfer was shown by Chen, Mo"

Honomichl (2004). They used a statue problem, 
in which the chief of a riverside village needs 

to measure an amount of gold equal in weight 

to a statue without using a weighing machine. 

The solution involves putting the statue in a tub 

(mentioned in the problem), placing the tub in 

the river, and observing how much lower the 

tub sits in the water when the statue is in it.
Chen et al. found that 69% of Chinese 
students but only 8% of American students 

solved the statue problem. The explanation of 

this huge difference is that there is a Chinese 

story (weigh the elephant) that closely resem-

bles the statue problem in that an elephant has 

to be weighed but the largest weighing machine 

available is much too small. The solution 

involves putting the elephant in a boat and 

marking the water level on the boat. After that, 

the elephant is replaced with small stones until 

the water level is the same as it was with the 

elephant. Finally, the small stones are weighed 

individually. The high level of performance of 

the Chinese students was based on far transfer 

based on their childhood exposure to the weigh-

the-elephant problem.

far transfer involves several different processing

Chen et al. manipulated the difÞculty of the 

target problem by varying the similarity of 

the goal object (elephant versus asteroid) and 

solution tool (boat versus spring platform) to 

the original tale. Chinese participants performed 

worst when the goal object and solution were 

both dissimilar to the tale (i.e., asteroid 
+
 

spring platform). This low level of performance 

was due to problems in accessing, mapping, 

and executing.
Effects of context similarity were obtained 
by Spencer and Weisberg (1986). Students 

solved an initial problem in a laboratory or a 
classroom and subsequently solved a related 

problem in a classroom or a laboratory. There 

was more transfer when the context was the 

same for both problems.
Effects of time interval on far transfer have 
nearly always been obtained. For example, 

Chen and Klahr (2008) discussed one of their 

studies in which transfer of hypothesis-testing 

strategies was tested one or two years after 

Þ
 rst testing. Children initially aged Þ ve or six 
showed some transfer of these strategies to 

problems with different perceptual and con-

textual features, but there was more transfer 

after one year than after two.
How can we enhance far transfer? De Corte 
(2003) found that metacognition is useful. 

Students studying business economics were 

provided with training over a seven-month 

period in two metacognitive skills: orienting 

and self-judging. Orienting involves preparing 

oneself to solve problems by thinking about 

possible goals and cognitive activities. Self-

judging is a motivational activity designed to 

assist students to assess accurately the effort 

required for successful task completion.
De Corte found on the subsequent learning 
of statistics that students who had received the 

training performed better than those who had 

not. Within the group that had been trained,

(2008) theoretical and experimental approach? 

First, there are relatively few studies in which 

context similarity has been manipulated, and 

social context in particular has not been con-

sidered in detail.
The high level of performance of the Chinese 
students in Chen et al.Õs (2004) statue problem 

was based on far transfer resulting from their 

childhood exposure to the weigh-the-elephant 

problem.

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
Second, we still do not know much about 
the underlying mechanisms. For example, 
why
 
exactly does changing the context between 
initial and subsequent problem solving lead to 

reduced transfer?
Third, individual differences in intelligence 
are de-emphasised in Chen and KlahrÕs approach. 

For example, Davidson and Sternberg (1984) 

found that children of high intelligence per-

formed at the same level as those of average 

intelligence on logical-mathematical problems 

when they had not been given any previous 

examples. However, gifted children (but not 

average children) showed substantial positive 

transfer when exposed to a 
single
 previous 

example. In a study discussed earlier, De Corte 

(2003) found that training in metacognitive 

skills produced more transfer among the most 

intelligent students.
Analogical problem solving
Much research on positive and negative transfer 

( especially near transfer) has involved analogical

larities between the current problem and one 

or more problems solved in the past. Analogical 

problem solving has proved important in the 

history of science. For example, the New Zealand 

physicist, Ernest Rutherford, used a solar sys-

tem 
analogy to understand the structure of the 
atom. 
More speciÞ cally, he argued that electrons 
revolve around the nucleus in the same way 

that the planets revolve around the sun. Other 

examples include the computer model of human 

information processing, the billiard-ball model 

of gases, and the hydraulic model of the blood 

circulation system. Thus, when people do not 

have knowledge directly relevant to a problem,  

they apply knowledge indirectly by 
analogy
 to 

the problem.
Under what circumstances do people make 
successful use of previous problems to solve a 

current problem? What is crucial is that they 

notice (and make use of) similarities between 

the current problem and a previous one. Chen 

(2002) identiÞ
 ed
 three
 main types of similarity 
between problems:
Super˚ cial similarity
(1) 
: solution-irrelevant 
details (e.g., speciÞ
 c objects) are common 
to both problems.

Structural similarity
(2) 
: causal relations among
 
some of the main components are shared 

by both problems.

Procedural similarity
(3) 
: procedures for 
turning the solution principle into con-

crete operations are common to both 

problems.
Initially, we will consider some factors deter
-
mining whether people use relevant analogies 

when solving a problem. After that, we will 

consider the processes involved when people 

are given an explicit analogical problem to 

solve. Analogical reasoning performance has 

been found to correlate approximately 
+
0.7 

with intelligence (Spearman, 1927), which sug-

gests that higher-level cognitive processes are 

involved. More speciÞ
 cally, it has been argued 
that the central executive component of the

Evidence
Gick and Holyoak (1980) studied DunckerÕs 

radiation problem, in which a patient with a 

malignant tumour in his stomach can only be 

saved by a special kind of ray. However, a ray 

of sufÞ cient strength to destroy the tumour 

will also destroy the healthy tissue, whereas a 

ray that does not harm healthy tissue will be 

too weak to destroy the tumour.
Only 10% of participants given the radiation 
problem on its own managed to solve it. The 

correct answer is to direct several low-intensity 

rays at the tumour from different directions. 

Other participants were given three stories to 

memorise, one of which was structurally similar 

to the radiation problem. This story was about 

a general capturing a fortress by having his 

army converge at the same time on the fortress 

along several different roads. When participants 

were told this story was relevant to solving the 

radiation problem, 80% of them solved it (see 

Figure 12.13). When no hint was offered, only 

40% solved the problem, presumably because

many of the participants failed to use the ana-
logy provided by the story. Thus, the fact that 

relevant information is stored in long-term 

memory is no guarantee that it will be used.
Why did Gick and HolyoakÕs (1980) par-
ticipants fail to make spontaneous use of the 

relevant story they had memorised? Keane 

(1987) suggested that the lack of superÞ
 cial 
similarities between the story and the problem 

may have been important. He presented students 

with a semantically close story (about a surgeon 

using rays on a cancer) or a semantically 

remote story (the general-and-fortress story). 

They were given this story during a lecture, 

and then took part in an experiment involving 

the radiation problem several days"

spontaneously retrieved it when given the 

radiation problem. In contrast, only 12% of

Blanchette and Dunbar (2000) argued that 
we should not conclude that most people focus 

mainly on the superÞ cial similarities between 

problems at the expense of structural similar-

ities. Most laboratory studies use a Òreception 

paradigmÓ in which participants are provided 

with detailed information about one or more 

possible analogies before being presented with 

a current problem. In contrast, what typically 

happens in everyday life is that people produce 

their own analogies rather than being given them. 

Blanchette and Dunbar compared performance 
using the standard reception paradigm and the 

more realistic Òproduction paradigmÓ in which 

people generated their own analogies. As in 

previous research, people in the reception para-

digm often selected analogies based on superÞ
 cial 
similarities. However, those in the production 

paradigm tended to produce analogies sharing 

structural features with the current problem.
Dunbar and Blanchette (2001) studied what 
leading molecular biologists and immunologists 

said during laboratory meetings when they were 

Þ
 xing experimental problems and formulating 
hypotheses. When the scientists used analogies 

to Þ x experimental problems, the previous 

problem was often superÞ cially similar to the 

current one. When scientists were generating 

hypotheses, the analogies they used involved 

fewer superÞ cial similarities and considerably 

more structural similarities. The take-home 

message is that the types of analogy that people 

use depend importantly on their current goals.
It has often been assumed that individuals 
who realise that a current problem has impor-

tant similarities with a previous problem are 

almost certain to solve it. Chen (2002) disagreed.

than those provided with an initial story con-

taining only structural similarity to the problem.  

Many of those in the latter condition grasped 

the general solution based on weight equivalence, 

but could not Þ nd appropriate procedures to 

solve the problem. Thus, effective analogies 

often need to possess procedural as well as 

structural similarity to a current problem.
Morrison, Holyoak, and Truong (2001) 
studied the processes involved in analogical 

problem solving. Participants were presented 

with verbal analogies (e.g., BLACK: WHITE:: 

NOISY: QUIET) and decided whether they 

were true or false. They were also presented 

with picture-based analogies involving cartoon 

characters. The analogies were either solved 

on their own or while participants performed

rehearsal-based system), or the visuo-spatial

What did Morrison et al. (2001) Þ
 nd? First, 
performance on both verbal and pictorial 

analogies was impaired when the additional 

task involved the central executive. This Þ
 nding 
suggests that solving analogies requires use of 

the central executive, which has limited capacity. 

Second, performance on verbal analogies was 

impaired when the additional task involved 

the phonological loop. This occurred because 

both tasks involved verbal processing. Third, 

performance on pictorial analogies suffered when 

the additional task involved the visuo-spatial 

sketchpad.
Krawczyk et al. (2008) argued that analogical 
problem solving depends in part on executive 

processes that inhibit responding to relevant 

distractors. For example, consider a picture 

analogy as follows:
sandwich: lunchbox:: hammer: ?????
The task is to choose one of the following 

options: toolbox (correct); nail (semantic dis-

tractor); gavel (auctioneerÕs hammer: perceptual
 
distractor); and ribbon (irrelevant distractor). 
According to Krawczyk et al., inhibitory execu-

tive processes involve the prefrontal cortex. 

Accordingly, they used a group of patients with 

damage to the prefrontal cortex, another group 

with damage to the temporal area, and a control 

group of healthy individuals.
What did Krawcyzk et al. (2008) Þ
 nd? 
First, the frontal damage patients were more 

likely than the temporal damage patients to give 

incorrect responses involving relevant semantic 

or perceptual distractors. Second, only the frontal 

patients had enhanced performance on pictorial 

analogies when no relevant distractors were 

present (see Figure 12.14). These Þ
 ndings suggest 
that an intact prefrontal cortex is needed to 

inhibit related but incorrect answers in analogical 

problem solving.
How can we improve analogical problem 
solving? "

and the fortress initially, followed by the 
radiation problem. Another group received the 

problem about the general and another analo-

gous problem initially, and considered similarities 

between them. After that, they received the 

radiation problem. A third group received the 

problem about the general initially. After that, 

they were presented with the radiation problem 

and another analogous problem, and told to 

look for similarities between them.
What happened in the above experiment? 
The radiation problem was rarely solved by 

members of the control group. Performance was 

much better in both of the other two groups. 

Directly comparing the structure of two analo-

gous 
problems promotes understanding of 
the underlying structure and leads to greatly 

improved analogical problem solving.
Evaluation

mining whether individuals will use relevant 

past knowledge in analogical problem solving. 

For example, superÞ cial, structural, and pro-

cedural similarity between past p"

the nature of the individualÕs task and the goals 

they have set themselves both inß
 uence analogical 
thinking. The central executive component of 

the working memory system is heavily involved 

in analogical problem solving, as is the visuo-

spatial sketchpad with pictorial problems or 

the phonological loop with verbal problems. 

Inhibitory executive processes are needed to 

prevent interference from distractors.
What are the limitations of research on 
analogical problem solving? First, analogical 

problems in the laboratory can often be solved 

by using an appropriate analogy provided earlier 

in the experiment. In everyday life, in contrast, 

the Þ t or match between previous knowledge 

and the current problem is typically imprecise. 

Second, individuals in the laboratory generally 

focus on superÞ cial similarities between past 

problems and a current one, whereas structural 

similarities are often more important in more 

realistic situations (Blanchette & Dunbar, 2000; 

Dunbar & Blanchette, 2001). Third, some 
people are much better than others at Þ
 nding 
and using analogies. As yet, however, there 

has been little research focused on individual 

differences in performance.
EXPERTISE
So far in this chapter we have mostly discussed 

studies in which the time available for learning 

has been short, the tasks involved relatively 

limited, and prior speciÞ c knowledge is not 

required. In the real world, however, people 

sometimes spend several years acquiring know-

ledge and skills in a given area (e.g., psychology, 

law, medicine, journalism). The end point of 

such long-term learning is the development of 

expertise, which is Òhighly skilled, competent 

performance in one or more task domains 

[areas]Ó (Sternberg & Ben-Zeev, 2001, p. 365).

on the road to achieving expertise. This is the

contrast, studies on expertise have typically 
used Òknowledge-richÓ problems requiring 

much 
knowledge beyond that presented in the

itself.
In this section, we will Þ rst consider in 
detail one speciÞ c domain of expertise, namely, 

chess expertise. There are several advantages 

to studying chess playing (Gobet, Voogt, & 

Retschitzki, 2004). First, the ELO ranking 

system provides a precise and valid assessment 

of individual playersÕ level of expertise. Second, 

expert chess players develop speciÞ
 c cognitive 
skills (e.g. pattern recognition; selective search) 

that are useful in other areas of expertise. Third, 

information about chess expertsÕ remarkable 

memory for chess positions generalises very 

well to most other forms of expertise.
After discussing chess expertise, we turn 
to the important issue of medical expertise, 

especially as it applies to medical diagnosis. 

Finally, we will analyse EricssonÕs theoretical 

approach, according to which deliberate pr"

of expertise.
Chess expertise
Why do some people excel at playing chess? 

According to Chase and Simon (1973b), no 

one can become an international chess master 

without devoting at least one decade to intensive 

practice. This ten-year rule is generally accepted 

as a reasonable estimate of the practice period 

needed to develop chess-playing excellence.
What beneÞ
 ts occur as a result of practice? 
Expert chess players have very detailed know-

ledge about chess positions stored in long-term 

memory. This allows them to relate the position 

in the current game to those in previous games. 

De Groot (1965) assessed individual differences 

in such knowledge. Participants received brief 

presentations (between 2 and 15 seconds) of 

board positions from actual games. After re-

moving the board, De Groot asked them to 

reconstruct the positions. Chess masters recalled 

the positions very accurately (91% correct), 

whereas less expert players made many more 

errors (41% correct). This difference reß
 ected 
differences in stored chess information rather 

than differences in memory ability because there 

were no group differences in remembering 

random board positions.
Chase and Simon (1973a) argued that chess 
players memorising chess positions break them 

down into about seven 
chunks
 or units. Their 

key assumption was that the chunks formed 

by expert players contain more information 

than those of other players. They asked three 

chess players to look at the position of the 

pieces on one board, and to reconstruct it on 

a second board with the Þ
 rst board still visible. 
Chase and Simon argued that the number of 

pieces placed on the second board after each 

glance at the Þrst board provided a measure 

of chunk size. The most expert player had 

chunks averaging 2.5 pieces, whereas the novice 

had chunks averaging only 1.9 pieces. In fact, 

however, these are substantial undere"

Chase and Simon (1973b) argued, in their  chunking theory, that a major advantage held   by chess experts is that they have very large   numbers of chess chunks stored in long-term   memory. Simon and Gilmartin (1973) estimated   that chess experts have between 10,0",Explores how emotion influences cognition.,"attention, emotion, memory",Nested under Chapter on memory,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in recognition,Aligned with contemporary studies on recognition,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_1260,"stimates 

(Gobet & Simon, 1998).
Chase and Simon (1973b) argued, in their 
chunking theory, that a major advantage held 

by chess experts is that they have very large 

numbers of chess chunks stored in long-term 

memory. Simon and Gilmartin (1973) estimated 

that chess experts have between 10,000 and 

100,000 chunks stored in their memories, and 

computer simulations have suggested a Þ
 gure 
of 300,000 chunks (Gobet & Simon, 2000). 

However, we should not assume that the 
only
 

advantage that chess experts have over novices 

is that they have stored information about tens 

of thousands of chess pieces. That would be 

like arguing that the only advantage Shakespeare 

had over other writers was a larger vocabulary!
The strategies used by human expert chess 
players do not resemble those used by chess-

playing computers, which do almost unimag-

inable amounts of search. For example, the 

computer Deep Blue processed about 200 million 

positions per second, and considered up to 
chunk:
 a stored unit formed from integrating 
smaller pieces of information.

about six moves ahead. This vast amount of 
search allowed it to beat the then World Chess 

Champion, Garry Kasparov, in May 1997. In 

order to understand human chess playing, we 

need to turn from computers to template theory, 

which represents a major development of 

chunking theory.
Template theory
Gobet and Waters (2003) identiÞ
 ed two major 
weaknesses with chunking theory. First, it fails 

to relate mechanisms at the chunk level with 

the higher-level representations used by expert 

chess players. Second, the theory predicts that 
it will take longer than is actually the case to 

encode chess positions.
Template theory overcomes the above 
weaknesses with chunking theory. According to 

template theory, chunks that are used freque"
Segment_862,ntly   develop into more complex data structures   known as templates. A  template  is a schematic  structure that is more general than an actual   board position. Each template consists of a  core   (very similar to the Þ xed information stored   in chunks) plus  slots  (which contain variable   in,Explores how emotion influences cognition.,"perception, memory, recognition",Nested under Chapter on memory,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in memory,Aligned with contemporary studies on awareness,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_282,"ntly 

develop into more complex data structures 

known as templates. A 
template
 is a schematic 
structure that is more general than an actual 

board position. Each template consists of a
 core
 
(very similar to the Þ xed information stored 

in chunks) plus 
slots
 (which contain variable 

information about pieces and locations). A 

template is larger than a chunk and is a more 

complex and abstract representation. It typically 

stores information relating to about ten pieces, 

although it can be larger than that. The fact that 

templates contain slots means that templates 

are more ß exible and adaptable than chunks.
Template theory makes several testable 
predictions. First, it predicts that the chunks 

into which information about chess positions 

is organised are larger and fewer in number 

than is assumed by chunking theory. More 

speciÞ
 cally, it is assumed that chess positions 
are stored in three templates, with some of these  

templates being relatively large.
Second, it is assumed that outstanding chess 
players owe their excellence mostly to their 

superior template-based knowledge of chess 

rather than their use of slow, strategy-based 

processes. It is assumed that their knowledge 

can be accessed rapidly, and allows them to 

narrow down the possible moves they need to 

consider. If these assumptions are correct, then 

the performance of outstanding players should 

remain extremely high even when making their 

moves under considerable time pressure.
Third, it is assumed that expert chess players

together are most likely to be found in the same  
template (Gobet & Simon, 2000).
Fourth, it is predicted that expert chess 
players will have better recall of apparently 

random chess positions than non-experts. The 

reason is that some patterns occur by chance 

even in random positions, and these patterns 

relate to template-based information.
Fifth, the emphasis within template theory 
is very much on the notion that chess-playing 

expertise depends on domain-speciÞ
 c expertise 
rather than on more general abilities (e.g., intel-

ligence). Thus, individuals of high intelligence 

should have only a modest advantage at chess 

compared to those of lower intelligence.
Evidence
Gobet and Clarkson (2004) provided strong 

support for the Þ rst prediction. They started 

by pointing out two limitations in the research 

of Chase and Simon (1973a). Chase and Simon 

used only three players, and their master was 

in his forties and out of practice. More impor-

tantly, the players in their study had to move 

the pieces physically, and the limited capacity 

of the hand for holding chess pieces may have 

made chunk size seem smaller than is actually 

the case. Gobet and Clarkson removed these 

problems by using 12 chess players and a 

computer display so that chess pieces could be 

moved using a mouse.
Gobet and Clarkson (2004) found that the 
superior recall of chess board positions by 

expert players was due to the larger size of 

their templates. The maximum template size 

was about 13Ð15 for masters compared to 

only about six for beginners. The number of 

templates did not vary as a function of playing 

strength and averaged out at about two. That 

is much closer to the prediction of template 

theory (i.e., "
Segment_864,"three) than to that of chunking   theory (i.e., seven). There is mixed support for the second  prediction. Charness, Reingold, Pomplun, and   Stampe (2001) asked expert and intermediate   chess players to study chess positions and identify   the best move. Their Þ  rst Þ  ve eye Þ  xations (last- in",Explores how perception influences cognition.,"memory, perception, attention",Nested under Chapter on awareness,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in emotion,Aligned with contemporary studies on perception,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_724,"three) than to that of chunking 

theory (i.e., seven).
There is mixed support for the second 
prediction. Charness, Reingold, Pomplun, and 

Stampe (2001) asked expert and intermediate 

chess players to study chess positions and identify 

the best move. Their Þ
 rst Þ
 ve eye Þ
 xations (last-
ing in total only about one second) were recorded. 
Even at this early stage, the experts were more 

likely than the intermediate players to Þ
 xate on 
tactically relevant pieces (80% versus 64% of 

Þ xations, respectively).
Burns (2004) considered chess performance 
in normal competitive games and in blitz chess, 

in which the entire game must be completed in 

Þ
 ve minutes (less than 5% of the time available  
in normal chess). The basic assumption was 

that playersÕ performance in blitz chess must 

depend mainly on their template-based know-

ledge, because there is so little time to engage 

in slow searching through possible moves. If 

template theory is correct, then players who 

perform best in normal chess should also tend 

to perform best in blitz chess. The reason is that 

the key to successful chess (i.e., template-based 

knowledge) is available in both forms of chess.
What did Burns (2004) Þ
 nd? The key 
Þ
 nding was that performance in blitz chess 
correlated highly (between 
+
0.78 and 
+
0.90) 

with performance in normal chess, which 

accords with theoretical prediction. However, 

it was emphatically not the case that slow 

search processes were irrelevant. The same 

players playing chess under normal conditions 

and under blitz conditions made superior moves 

in the former condition, which provided much 

more time for slow searching.
Van Harreveld, Wagenmakers, and van 
der 
Maas (2007) also considered the effects 
of reducing the time available for chess moves. 

Skill differences between players were less pre-

dictive of game outcomes as the time available 

decreased. As they concluded, ÒThis result

the board occupied by given pieces and the 
pieces contained within a template are close 

together on the board (e.g., Gobet & Simon, 

1996a). However, McGregor and Howes (2002) 

identiÞ
 ed an important limitation with previous 
Þ
 ndings. The participants were generally asked 
to 
memorise
 board positions, whereas actual 
chess playing focuses much more on the need 

to 
evaluate
 board positions. McGregor and 
Howes argued that chess players evaluating a 

board position would probably remember the 

attack /defence relations among pieces rather 

than their precise locations.
McGregor and Howes (2002) asked expert 
and non-skilled players to evaluate 30 chess 

positions (decide which colour was winning 

or if there was no advantage). After that, there 

was a test of recognition memory on which 

the players decided whether or not they had 

seen each board position before. Some board 

positions were 
identical
 to those presented 

previously, others were 
shifted
 (all pieces moved 

one square horizontally), and others were 
dis-

torted
 (only one piece was moved one square, 

but this changed the attack/defence relations). 

Expert players had much better memory for 

attack /defence relations than for the precise 
board locations of the pieces (see Figure 12.15). 

In another experiment, McGre"
Segment_866,"gor and Howes   found that the structure of chunks is deter-  mined more by attack /defence relations among   pieces than by proximity of pieces. The fourth prediction is that expert players  will have better recall than non-experts of   random chess positions.

found that the structure of chunks is deter-

pieces than by proximity of pieces.
The fourth prediction is that expert players 
will have better recall than non-experts of 

random chess positions. This contrasts with 

chunking theory, according to which there should 

be no effects of chess expertise on the ability 

to remember random chess positions. Gobet 

and Simon (1996b) carried out a meta-analysis 

and found there was a small effect of skill on 

random board positions. However, Gobet and 

Waters (2003) pointed out that the random 

board positions used in these studies were not 

totally random. More speciÞ cally, the positions 

of the pieces were random, but the pieces 

placed on the board were not selected at random 

(e.g., two kings were always present). Gobet 

and Waters used truly random positions and 

pieces. The Þ ndings were as predicted theoret-

ically by template theory: the number of pieces 

recalled varied from 14.8 for the most expert 

players to 12.0 for the least expert.

relatively little on general abilities such as 
intelligence. This prediction seems somewhat 

counterintuitive given that chess is a complex 

and intellectually demanding game. In fact, 

chess-playing ability has often been found to 

be almost unrelated to intelligence (see Gobet 

et al., 2004, for a review). However, individual "

differences in intelligence were moderately 

predictive of chess-playing level in a study 

by Grabner, Stern, and Neubauer (2007) on 

adult tournament chess players. They obtained 

a correlation of 
+
0.35 between general intel-

ligence and ELO 
ranking (a measure of playing 

ability). In 
addition, they found that numerical 
intelligence correlated 
+
0.46 with ELO ranking. 
However, as predicted by template theory, playersÕ 

chess experience (e.g., amount of practice) was 

an even better predictor of ELO ranking.
Evaluation
Template theory has several successes to its 

credit. First, as the theory assumes, there is 

evidence that much of the information that 

experts store from a board position is in the 

form of a few large templates rather than a 

larger number of chunks (Gobet & Clarkson, 

2004). Second, outstanding chess players possess  

much more knowledge about chess positions 

than do non-experts, and this gives them a 

substantial advantage when playing chess. For 

example, template-based knowledge explains 

why expert players can identify key pieces in 

a board position in under one second (Charness 

et al., 2001). Third, the tendency of experts to 

win at blitz chess is due mainly to their superior 

template-based knowledge. Fourth, as predicted 

theoretically, experts have better recall than 

non-experts of board positions even when the 

positions and the pieces are truly random (Gobet 

& Waters, 2003).
What are the limitations of template theory? 
First, slow search processes are more important 

to expert players than is assumed by the theory. 

For example, they look ahead more moves than 

non-expert ones (Charness, 1981) and skill 

level is less predictive of outcome with reduced 

time available per move (van Harreveld et al., 

2007). Bilali
c
, McLeod, and Gobet (2008) 
reported interesting Þ
 ndings. Chess players 
were presented with a chess problem that could 

be solved in Þ ve moves using a familiar strategy 
"
Segment_868,but in only three moves using a less familiar   solution. The players were told to look for the   shortest way to win.

but in only three moves using a less familiar 

solution. The players were told to look for the 

shortest way to win. They found that 50% of 

the International Masters found the shorter 

solution compared to 0% of the Candidate 

Masters. Precisely why the International Masters 

exhibited ß exibility of thought and avoided the 

familiar, template-based solution is unclear.
Second, there is a reduction in performance 
level for all chess players under severe time 

pressure (Burns, 2004), suggesting that all players 

rely to some extent on slow search processes. 

The distinction between routine and adaptive 

expertise (Hatano & Inagaki, 1986) may be 

relevant here. 
Routine expertise
 is involved 

when a player can solve familiar problems 

rapidly and efÞ
 ciently. In contrast,
 adaptive
 
expertise
 is involved when a player has to 

develop strategies for deciding what to do when 

confronted by a novel board position. Template 

theory provides a convincing account of what 

is involved in routine expertise. However, it is 

less clear that it sheds much light on adaptive 

expertise.
Third, the precise information stored in 
long-term memory remains controversial. It 

isassumed within the theory that templates 

consist mainly of pieces that were close together 

on the board, and that the precise locations of 

individual pieces are stored. However, attack /

defence relations seem to be more important 

(McGregor & Howes, 2002).
Fourth, there has been a tendency within 
template theory to exaggerate the importance 

of the sheer amount of time devoted to practice 
routine expertise:
 using acquired knowledge 
to solve familiar problems efÞ ciently.

adaptive expertise:
 using acquired knowledge 

to develop strategies for dealing with novel 

problems.

(2007) that intelligence (especially numer-  ical intelligence) is moderately predictive of   chess-playing expertise seems unexpected from   the perspective of template theory.

et al. (2007) that intelligence (especially numer-

ical intelligence) is moderately predictive of 

chess-playing expertise seems unexpected from 

the perspective of template theory.
Medical expertise
We turn now to medical expertise, speciÞ
 cally 
the ability of medical experts to make rapid 

and accurate diagnoses. This involves complex 

decision making, which is discussed in more 

general terms in Chapter 13.
Medical decision making is often literally 
a matter of life-or-death, and even experts 

make mistakes. The number of deaths per year 

in the United States attributable to preventable 

medical error is between 44,000 and 98,000. 

This makes it extremely important to under-

stand medical expertise. Of course, medical 

experts with many years of training behind 

them generally make better decisions than novice 

doctors. However, what is less obvious is pre-

cisely 
how
 the superior knowledge of medical 
experts translates into superior diagnoses and 

decision making.
Several theorists have argued that the medical 
reasoning of experts differs considerably from 

that of novices and does not simply involve 

using the same strategies more effectively. There  

are important differences among these theorists. 

However, as Engel (2008) pointed out, there 

is an important distinction between explicit 

reasoning and implicit reasoning. Explicit 

reasoning is relatively slow, deliberate, and is 

associated with conscious awareness, whereas 

implicit reasoning is fast, automatic, and is not 

associated with conscious awareness. The crucial 

assumption is that medical novices engage mainly 

in explicit reasoning, whereas medical experts 

engage mainly in implicit reasoning.
Theorists differ in the terms they use to 
refer to the above distinction. For example, 

Norman, Young, and Brooks (2007) distinguishes 

between analytic 
reasoning strategies (explicit 

reasoning) and 
non-analytic rea"
Segment_870,"soning strategies  (implicit reasoning). In contrast, Kundel, Nodine,  Conant, and Weinstein (2007) distinguished   between  focal search (explicit reasoning) and  global impression (implicit reasoning). Note   that a  distinction very similar to those just   discussed has been very inß uential in r",Explores how attention influences cognition.,"emotion, memory, attention",Nested under Chapter on memory,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in perception,Aligned with contemporary studies on emotion,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_786,"soning strategies 
(implicit reasoning). In contrast, Kundel, Nodine, 
Conant, and Weinstein (2007) distinguished 

between 
focal search (explicit reasoning) and 
global impression (implicit reasoning). Note 

that a 
distinction very similar to those just 

discussed has been very inß uential in reasoning  

research generally (see Chapter 14) and in 

research on judgement and decision making 

(see Chapter 13).
We should note three qualiÞ cations on the 
notion that the development of medical exper-

tise leads from a reliance on explicit reasoning 

to one on implicit reasoning. First, as we will 

see, that is only approximately correct. For 

example, medical experts may start with fast, 

automatic processes but generally cross-check 

their diagnoses with slow, deliberate processes. 

Second, it is likely that fast, automatic process-

ing strategies are used considerably more often 

in 
visual
 specialities such as pathology, radiology, 
and dermatology than in more 
technical
 spe-

cialities such as surgery or anaesthesiology 

(Engel, 2008). Third, while we have empha-

sised the similarities in the views of different 

theorists, we must avoid assuming that there 

are no important differences.
Evidence
How can we identify the diagnostic strategies 

used by medical novices and experts? One 

interesting approach is to track eye movements 

while doctors examine case slides. This was 

done by Krupinsky et al. (2006) and Kundel 

et al. (2007). Krupinsky et al. recorded eye 

movements while medical students, pathology 

residents, and fully trained pathologists exam-

ined slides relating to breast biopsy cases. 

The fully trained pathologists spent least time 

examining each slide (4.5 seconds versus 7.1 

seconds for residents and 11.9 seconds for 

students). Of more importance, greater exper-

tise was associated with more information 

being extracted from the initial Þ xation. In the 

terminology used by Krupinsky et al., experts 

relied he"

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
Kundel et al. (2007) presented difÞ
 cult 
mammograms showing or not showing breast 
cancer to doctors experienced in mammography. 

The mean search time for the mammograms 

showing cancer was 27 seconds. However, the 

median time to Þ xate a cancer was 1.13 seconds, 

and was typically less than one second for the 

experts. There was a strong negative correla-

tion of about 
−
0.9 between time of Þ
 rst Þ xation 
on the cancer and performance, meaning that 

fast Þ xation was an excellent predictor of high 

performance. The most expert doctors typically 

fixated almost immediately on the cancer, 

suggesting that they used holistic or global 

processes. In contrast, the least expert doctors 

seemed to rely on a slower, more analytic search-

to-Þ
 nd processing strategy.
Convincing evidence that the processing 
strategies of medical experts differ from those 

of non-experts was reported by Kulatunga-

Moruzi, Brooks, and Norman (2004) in a study 

on skin lesions. They argued that non-experts 

use an analytic, rule-based strategy in which 

the various clinical features are considered 

carefully before any diagnoses are entertained. 

In contrast, experts use an automatic exemplar-

based strategy in which they rapidly search for 

a stored exemplar that closely resembles any 

given case photograph. There were three groups: 

expert dermatologists; moderately expert general 

practitioners; and less knowledgeable resident 

doctors. In one condition, they were shown 

case photographs and made diagnoses. In another 

condition, they were initially given a com-

prehensive verbal description followed by the"
Segment_872,"relevant case photograph, and made a diagnosis   after the photograph. What Þ  ndings would we expect to Þ  nd? If  non-experts (i.e., resident doctors) base their   diagnoses mostly on clinical features, they   should have found the verbal descriptions to   be valuable. If experts (i.e., the derm",Explores how perception influences cognition.,"attention, awareness, recognition",Nested under Chapter on recognition,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in emotion,Aligned with contemporary studies on awareness,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_656," 
relevant case photograph, and made a diagnosis 

after the photograph.
What Þ
 ndings would we expect to Þ
 nd? If 
non-experts (i.e., resident doctors) base their 

diagnoses mostly on clinical features, they 

should have found the verbal descriptions to 

be valuable. If experts (i.e., the dermatologists) 

base their diagnoses mostly on an exemplar-

based strategy, they might have found that the 

verbal descriptions interfered with effective 

use of that strategy. These predictions were 

supported by the Þ ndings (see Figure 12.16). 

The diagnostic accuracy of the non-experts was 

higher when their diagnoses were based on 

verbal descriptions as well as photographs. 

In striking contrast, the more expert groups 

performed better when they werenÕt exposed 

to the verbal descriptions.
Are there circumstances in which experts 
perform 
worse
 than non-experts? Adam and 
Reyna (2005) argued that the answer is, ÒYesÓ. 

According to fuzzy-trace theory, experts are 

more likely than non-experts to make use of 

gist-based processing. This has various advant-

ages. It generally means that experts are very 

discriminating
: they base their decisions on 

crucial information while largely ignoring 

less important details. However, gist-based 

processing involves simplifying the issues, and 

this can sometimes impair performance through 

oversimpliÞ cation.

expected, experts in the Þ eld generally dis-
played more knowledge of the risks of various 

sexually transmitted infections. However, there 

were some exceptions. Most sexually transmitted  

infections are ß uid-borne. Accordingly, gist-

based representations would focus on those 

infections rather than the rarer infections that 

are transmitted through skin-to-skin contact. 

For example, the experts greatly underestimated 

the prevalence of human papillomavirus (which 

is transmitted through skin-to-skin contact) 

compared to sexually transmitted infections 

that are ß uid-borne. In addition, expertsÕ de-

emphasis on infections caused by skin-to-skin 

contact led them to overestimate the effectiveness 

of condoms in preventing sexually transmitted 

infections.
Reyna and Lloyd (2006) presented doctors 
possessing varying degrees of relevant expertise 

with information about hypothetical patients 

at different levels of cardiac risk. There were 

three main Þ ndings, all consistent with the 

assumption that experts tend to use gist-based 

processing:
The most expert doctors (cardiologists

and nationally recognised experts in cardio-

logy) were better than the less expert ones

Evaluation
Much progress has been made in understanding  

medical expertise. There is convincing evidence 

that the processes used by medical experts and 

non-experts in diagnosis often differ qualita-

tively. It is approximately the case that medical 

experts compared to non-experts rely more on

on slow, conscious ones, but there are many 

exceptions to that generalisation. Unsurprisingly,  
medical experts typically outperform non-

experts. However, there is interesting evidence 

that expertsÕ reliance on gist-based processes 

can impair their performance.
What are the limitations of theory and 
research on medical expertise? First, nearly all 

studies have involved comparing experts and 

non-experts. This approach has provided much 

useful information, but suffers from the dis-

advantage that it is uninformative about the speciÞ
 c 
learning processes responsible for the develop-

ment of expertise. We need studies in which 

the impact of different learning strategies on the  

development of expertise is studied over time.
Second, there is a danger of underestimat-
ing the value of analytic processing, which is 

sometimes regarded as Òan optional extra in 

information processingÓ (McLaughlin, Remy, 

& Schmidt, 2008). As McLaughlin et al. pointed 

out, the relationship between expertise, infor-

mation processing, and diagnostic performance 

is more complex than is often assumed. This 

relationship is affected by several factors, 

including task difÞ culty, clinical domain, con-

text, and experimental conditions. The optimal 

strategy is for experts to use automatic and 

analytic processes ß exibly depending on the 

speciÞ
 c details of any given diagnostic task.
Third, we need research to compare the 
various theories. For example, some theories 
Medical experts often make use of fast,  
automatic processes in diagnosis, whereas 

non-experts rely more on slow, conscious 

processes.

Chess expertise vs. medical 
expertise
We will conclude this section with a brief com-
parison of chess and medical expertise. The 

two kinds of expertise share several similarities, 

although it is important not to exaggerate 

them. First, several years of intensive training 

are needed to attain genuine expertise. Second, 

the years of training lead to the acquisition of 

huge amounts of relevant stored knowledge 

that can be accessed rapidly. Third, those with 

expertise in either area are better able than 

non-experts to make use of rapid (possibly 

ÒautomaticÓ) processes. Fourth, experts have 

the ability to make ß exible use of analytic or 

strategy-based processes as and when required.
What are the differences between chess 
expertise and medical expertise? First, there is 

suggestive evidence that the form in which 

knowledge is stored differs between the two 

kinds of expertise. More speciÞ cally, much of 

the knowledge of chess experts is stored in the 

form of fairly abstract templates. In contrast, 

the knowledge of medical experts is perhaps less  

abstract and is stored in the form of exemplars. 

Second, there are important differences in the 

ways in which chess and medical experts use 

their expertise. Chess experts have to relate a 

current chess position to their stored knowledge 

and then think deeply about the implications 

for their subsequent moves and those of their 

opponent. In contrast, the task of medical experts 

is more narrowly focused on relating the infor-

mation they have to their stored knowledge.
DELIBERATE PRACTICE
Everyone knows that prolonged and carefully 

organised practice is essential in the develop-
ment of almost any kind of expertise. That is 

a useful starting point. However, what we 

really need is a theory in which the details of 

what is involved in effective practice are s"

Precisely that was done by Ericsson,   Krampe, and Tesch-Rımer (1993) and Ericsson    and Lehmann (1996), who argued that a wide   range of expertise can be developed through   deliberate practice.

Krampe, and Tesch-Rımer (1993) and Ericsson  

and Lehmann (1996), who argued that a wide 

range of expertise can be developed through 

deliberate practice. 
Deliberate practice 
has four 

aspects:
The task is at an appropriate level of 
(1) 
difÞ
 
culty (not too easy or hard).
The learner is given informative feedback 
(2) 
about his/her performance.

The learner has adequate chances to repeat 
(3) 
the task.

The learner has the opportunity to correct 
(4) 
his/her errors.
According to Ericsson et al. (1993, p. 368), 

ÒThe amount of time an individual is engaged 

in deliberate practice activities is monotonically 

[never decreasingly] related to that individualÕ
s 
acquired performance.Ó
What exactly happens as a result of pro-
longed deliberate practice? According to Ericsson 

and Kintsch (1995), experts can get round 

the limited capacity of working memory. They 

proposed the notion of 
long-term working 

memory
: experts learn how to store relevant 

information in long-term memory so that it 

can be accessed readily through retrieval cues 

held in working memory. This does not mean 

that experts have greater working memory 

capacity than everyone else. Instead, they are 
deliberate practice:
 this form of practice 
involves the learner being provided with 

informative feedback and having the opportunity 

to correct his/her errors.

long-term working memory:
 this is used 

by experts to store relevant information in 

long-term memory and to access it through 

retrieval cues in 
working memory

are three requirements for long-term working

2001):

The activity in which the individual is 
(2) 
engaged must be very familiar so that 

he/she can predict what information will 

subsequently need to be retrieved.

The information that is stored must be 
(3) 
associated with appropriate retrieval cues 

so that subsequent presentation of the 

retrieval cues leads to retrieval of the stored 

information.
Finally, we come to the most controversial 
theoretical assumption, namely
, that deliberate 
practice is 
all
 that is needed to develop expert 

performance. It follows from that assumption 

that innate talent or ability has practically no 

inß
 uence on expert performance, a conclusion 
that seems implausible.
Evidence
There is support for the notion that experts 

make use of long-term working memory to 

enhance their ability to remember information. 

Ericsson and Chase (1982) studied SF, a student 

at Carnegie-Mellon University in the United 

States. He was given extensive practice on the 

digit-span task on which random digits have 

to be recalled immediately in the correct order. 

Initially, his digit span was about seven digits. 

He was then paid to practise the digit-span 

task for one hour a day for two years. At the 

end of that time, he reached a digit span of 

80 digits, which is about ten times the average 

level of performance.
How did SF do it? He reached a digit span 
of about 18 items by using his extensive know-

ledge of running times. For example, if the Þ
 rst 
few digits presented were Ò3594Ó, he would 

note that this was BannisterÕs world-record time 

for the mile, and so these four digits would 

be stored as a single unit or chunk. He then 
increased his digit span by organising these 

chunks into a hierarchical retrieval structure. 

Thus, SF made effective use of long-term work-

ing memory by using meaningful encoding, 

developing a retrieval structure, and taking 

advantage of speed-up produced by extensive 

practice.
Experts in many area"
Segment_878,"s have excellent long- term working memory (see Ericsson & Kintsch,   1995). For example, the Þ rst author is constantly   surprised by how expert bridge players can   recall nearly every detail of hands that have   just been played. Norman, Brooks, and Allen   (1989) found that medical experts were",Explores how perception influences cognition.,"perception, emotion, memory",Nested under Chapter on perception,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in recognition,Aligned with contemporary studies on awareness,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_334,"s have excellent long-
term working memory (see Ericsson & Kintsch, 

1995). For example, the Þ rst author is constantly 

surprised by how expert bridge players can 

recall nearly every detail of hands that have 

just been played. Norman, Brooks, and Allen 

(1989) found that medical experts were much 

better than novices when unexpectedly asked 

to recall medical information. This is consistent 

with the notion that they had superior long-term 

working memory.
Evidence that retrieval structures are impor-
tant was reported by Ericsson and Chase (1982). 

Highly practised participants learned digit 

matrices consisting of 25 digits in 5 
×
 5 displays,  
setting up retrieval structures so they could 

recall the digits row by row. When recalling 

the digits column by column, their performance 

was much slower because their retrieval struc-

tures did not match the requirements of the 

task.
According to Ericsson and Lehmann (1996), 
what is important in acquiring expertise is the 

amount of 
deliberate
 practice rather than simply 

the sheer amount of practice. Charness, TufÞ
 ash, 
Krampe, Reingold, and Vasyukova (2005) found 

among tournament-rated chess players that time 

spent on serious study alone, tournament play, 

and formal instruction all predicted chess-playing 

expertise. Of those factors, serious study alone 

was the strongest predictor correlating approx-

imately 
+
0.50 with current playing level. Grand-
masters had spent an average of 5000 hours on  

serious study alone during their Þ rst ten years of  

playing chess, nearly Þ
 ve times as much as the 
a mount of time spent by intermediate players.
Deliberate practice has also been shown to 
be important in the development of expertise 

in other contexts. Ericsson, Krampe, and Tesch-

Rımer (1993) reported a study on violinists 

in a German music academy. The key difference

of deliberate practice they had had over the 

years. The most expert violinists had spent on 

average nearly 7500 hours engaged in deliberate  

practice compared to the 5300 hours clocked 

up by the good violinists.
The above study only showed that there is 
a correlation or association between amount 

of deliberate practice and level of performance. 

Perhaps those musicians with the greatest innate 

talent and/or musical success decide to spend 

more time practising than those with less talent 

or previous success. However, contrary evidence 

was reported by Sloboda, Davidson, Howe, and 

Moore (1996), who compared highly successful 
young musicians with less successful ones. The 

two groups did not differ in the amount of 

practice they required to achieve a given level of  

performance. This suggests that the advantage 

possessed by the very successful musicians is 

not due to their greater level of natural musical 

ability.
TufÞ
 ash, Roring, and Ericsson (2007) 
obtained evidence for the importance of delib-

erate practice among 40 tournament-rated 

Scrabble players. The main comparisons were 

between elite and average players having com-

parable levels of verbal ability. The elite players 

spent more time than the average players on 

deliberate practice activities (e.g., analysis of 

their own previous games; solving anagrams), 

but the two groups did not differ with respect 

to other forms of practice (e.g., playing Scrabble 

for fun; playing in Scrabble tournaments). In 

addition, lifetime accumulated study of Scrabble 

was a reasonable predictor of Scrabble-playing 

expertise.

when essentially the same subtraction problem 

was expressed as, ÒWhat is 34 minus 8?Ó, he 

took much longer to produce an answer and 

the answer was often wrong!
More evidence that high intelligence is 
not needed for narrow forms of expertise was 

reported by Ceci and Liker (1986). They studied 

individuals with considerable expertise about 

harness racing, in which horses pull a sulky 

(a light two-wheeled cart). They identiÞ
 ed 14 
experts whose IQs ranged from 81 to 128, 

with four of them having IQs in the low 80s. 

These experts worked out probable odds which 

involved taking account of complex interactions 

among up to seven variables (e.g., each horseÕs 

lifetime speed; track size). The expertsÕ high 

level of performance did not depend at all on 

a high IQ Ð the correlation between perform-

ance and IQ was

importance of intelligence in the development 

of very broad expertise. For most people, the 

broadest expertise they are likely to acquire 

is in their career, especially those involving 

complex skills. Gottfredson (1997) discussed 

the literature on intelligence and occupational 

success. The correlation between intelligence 

and work performance was only 
+
0.23 with 

low-complexity jobs (e.g., shrimp picker; corn-

husking machine operator), but rose to 
+
0.58 

for high-complexity jobs (e.g., biologist; city 

circulation manager). The mean IQ of those 

in very complex occupations (e.g., accountants; 

lawyers; doctors) is approximately 120 Ð130, 

which is much higher than the population 

mean of 100 (see Mackintosh, 1998).
There is a moderate correlation between intel-
ligence and socio-economic status (Mackintosh, 

1998), and so some of the effects of intelligence 

on job performance may actually be due to 

socio-economic status and related factors such 

as school quality or neighbourhood. However, 

this possibility was convincingly disproved by 

Murray (1998). He used a sample of male full 

biological siblings in intact families, thereby 
controlling for socio-economic status, schools, 

neighbourhood, and so on. The siblings with 

higher intelligence had more prestigious occu-

pations plus higher income. When they were 

in their late twenties, a person with average 

intelligence earned on average nearly $18,000 

(£10,500) less per annum than his sibling with 

an IQ of at least 120 but over $9,000 (£5,000) 

more than his sibling with an IQ of 80 or less.
Why is job performance well predicted by 
intelligence? Hunter and Schmidt (e.g., 1996) 

answered this question with a theory based on 

four main assumptions:
Work performance depends to a moder-

knowledge.

Highly intelligent individuals learn more

Evaluation
There is much support for the notion that 

memory in a domain of expertise can be devel-

oped via the use of long-term working memory.  

Most (or all) experts seem to develop superior 

long-term working memory, which serves to 

reduce limitations on processing capacity. The 

evidence also indicates that deliberate practice 

is more important than non-deliberate practice 

for the development of high levels of expertise; 

indeed, it appears to be 
necessary
 for the achieve-

ment of outstanding performance.

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
What are the limitations of deliberate prac-
tice theory? First, much evidence indicates that 
deliberate practice is 
not
 the only important 

factor in the development of expertise. For 

example, innate ability or intelligence predicts 

level of expertise as reß ected in occupational 

success (Gottfredson, 1997) or chess-playing 

performance (Grabner et al., 2007).
Second, the notion that innate talent is 
unimportant is unconvincing. As Sternberg and 

Ben-Zeev (2001, p. 302) argued, ÒIs one to 

believe that anyone could become a Mozart if 

only he or she put in the time? . . . Or that 

becoming an Einstein is just a matter of delib-

erate practice?Ó Why, then, does intelligence 

often fail to predict level of expertise? One 

reason may be "
Segment_883,"that most experts are highly   talented or intelligent, thus making it diffi-  cult for individual differences in intelligence   to predict performance. For example, Bilali c ,   McLeod, and Gobet (2008) found that there   was a  negative  correlation between intelligence   and chess-playing experti",Explores how recognition influences cognition.,"perception, awareness, attention",Nested under Chapter on attention,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in recognition,Aligned with contemporary studies on awareness,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_1261,"that most experts are highly 

talented or intelligent, thus making it diffi-

cult for individual differences in intelligence 

to predict performance. For example, Bilali
c
, 

McLeod, and Gobet (2008) found that there 

was a 
negative
 correlation between intelligence 

and chess-playing expertise among elite young 

chess players. However, the mean IQ of this elite 

sample was 133, which is at approximately the 

97th or 98th percentile.
Third, there are real methodological in-
adequacies in most of the research, which has 

shown only that the amount of deliberate 
practice is positively correlated with level of 

expertise. What generally happened was that 

individual participants themselves decided how 

much time to devote to deliberate practice, and 

so the amount of deliberate practice was not 

under experimental control. Perhaps those indi-

viduals having high levels of innate talent or who 

encounter early success in a given domain (e.g., 

chess playing) are the ones most likely to engage  

in substantial amounts of deliberate practice.
Fourth, and related to the third point, there 
is an important issue that has not received 

enough attention. 
Why
 do some individuals 

decide to devote hundreds or thousands of 

hours to effortful deliberate practice to achieve 

very high levels of expertise? Deliberate prac-

tice theory has identiÞ ed some of the important 

cognitive factors involved in the development 

of expertise. However, it has been strangely 

silent on the crucial motivational factors that 

must also be involved.
Fifth, deliberate practice theory is less 
applicable to the development of broad and 

complex skills (e.g., becoming an outstanding 

lawyer) than the development of narrow and 

less complex skills (e.g., calendar calculating). 

That would explain why individual differences 

in intelligence are more predictive of the former 

type of expertise than the latter.

Problemsolving
¥
Problem solving is goal directed. The problems studied by psychologists are mostly
well-deÞ
 ned and knowledge-lean, which is the opposite of those generally encountered in
everyday life. The Gestalt psychologists argued that problems often require insight and

that past experience often disrupts current problem solving. Insight seems to involve parts

of the right hemisphere, and probably depends on parallel processes below the conscious 
level. OhlssonÕs representational change theory emphasises the importance of changing 

representations through elaboration, constraint relaxation, and re-encoding for insight to 

occur. The beneÞ cial effects of incubation on problem solving seem to depend on forget-

ting misleading information or ineffective strategies. The General Problem Solver assumes 

that processing is serial, people have limited processing capacity, and problem solvers 

make extensive use of heuristics. The General Problem Solver has better memory than 

(but inferior planning ability to) humans. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex plays a central 

role in problem solving. ACT-R theory claims that retrieval, imaginal, goal, and procedural 

modules are all important in problem solving, and the brain areas associated with each 

module are identiÞ

Transfer of training between a past task and a current one depends on task similarity,

context similarity, and time interval. Far transfer has been shown many times. It is enhanced

by metacognitive skills such as orienting and self-judging, and can also be increased by

self-explanation. Transfer in analogical problem solving depends on three kinds of similarity:
superÞ
 
cial, structural, and procedural. The kind of similarity used by experts when problem
solving depends on their speciÞ c goals. Analogical problem solving can be improved by
direct comparisons of the characteristics of two problems. Much laboratory research on

analogical problem solving differs considerably from real life in that analogies between

problems are typically imprecise in real life. The central executive plays a major role in

analogical problem solving, and executive processes that inhibit responding to relevant

distractors may be of special importance.
Expertise
¥
Expertise is typically assessed by using knowledge-rich problems. Expert chess players
differ from non-expert players in possessing far more templates containing knowledge of

chess positions. These templates allow expert players to identify good moves rapidly and

to remember even random chess positions better than non-experts. The precise informa-

tion contained in templates remains unclear and template theory does not fully account

for the adaptive expertise of outstanding players. It is generally agreed that medical experts

tend to rely on fast, automatic processes in diagnosis whereas non-experts rely on slow,

conscious processes. However, this is only approximately correct, and experts generally

cross-check their diagnoses with slow, deliberate processes. Medical experts often rely on

gist-based processes, which can impair their performance in some circumstances.

According to Ericsson, the development of expertise depends on deliberate practice

are willing to devote hundreds or thousands of hours to deliberate practice. At any rate,

the deliberate practice approach has relatively little to say about crucial motivational

factors.

JUDGEMENT AND 
DECISION MAKING
Finally, we turn to the relationship between 
judgement and decision making. According to 
Hastie (2001, p. 657), ﬁDecision making refers 

to the entire process of choosing a course of 

action. Judgement refers to the components 

of the larger decision-making process that are 

concerned with assessing, estimating, and in-

ferring what events will occur and what the 

decision-maker™s evaluative reactions to those 

outcomes will be.ﬂ
What does research on judgement and 
decision making tell us about human rationality? 

That issue is part of a broader one concerning 

human rationality and logicality in general. 

That broader issue (which includes considera-

tion of research on judgement and decision 

making) is discussed at length at the end of 

Chapter 14.
JUDGEMENT RESEARCH
We often change our opinion of the likelihood 

of something based on new information. 

Suppose you are 90% con˚ dent someone has 

lied to you. However, their version of events 

is later con˚ rmed by another person, leading 

you to believe there is only a 60% chance you 

have been lied to. Everyday life is full of cases 

in which the strength of our beliefs is increased 

or decreased by new information.
The Reverend Thomas Bayes provided a 
precise way of thinking about such cases. He 

focused on situations in which there are two 

possible beliefs or hypotheses (e.g., X is lying 
INTRODUCTION
In this chapter, our focus is on the overlapping 

areas of judgement and decision making. 

Judgement researchers focus on the ways in 

which individuals make use of various cues 

(which may be ambiguous) to draw inferences 

about situations and events. In contrast, deci-

sion making involves choosing among various 

options. Decision-making researchers address 

the question, ﬁHow do people choose what 

action to take to achieve labile [changeable], 

sometimes con˜ icting goals in an uncertain 

world?ﬂ (Hastie, 2001, p. 657).
There are other di"
Segment_888,"fferences between judge- ment and decision making. For example, judge-  ments are evaluated in terms of their  accuracy .  In contrast, the value of decisions is typically   assessed in terms of the  consequences  of those   decisions (Harvey, 2001).

ment and decision making. For example, judge-

ments are evaluated in terms of their 
accuracy
. 
In contrast, the value of decisions is typically 

assessed in terms of the 
consequences
 of those 

decisions (Harvey, 2001).
Decision making involves some problem 
solving, since individuals try to make the best 

possible choice from a range of options. However,  

there are some differences. First, the options 

are generally present in decision making, whereas  

problem solvers typically have to generate their 

own options. Second, decision making tends 

to be concerned with preferences, whereas 

problem solving is concerned with solutions. 

As a result, the focus in decision making is on 

the factors in˜ uencing preference. With problem 

solving, in contrast, the focus is on factors 

in˜
 uencing the choice of strategies (successful 
or unsuccessful).

), is 0.80. Finally, the 
probability of the eyewitness saying the cab 

was Blue when it was Green,

According to the formula:
0.15 
×
 0.80 
=
 0.12
0.85 0.20 0.17
Thus, the odds ratio is 12:17, and there is a 

41% (12/29) probability that the taxi-cab was 

Blue compared to a 59% probability that it 

was Green. As we will see very shortly, this is 

not
 the answer produced by most people given 

the problem.
Neglecting base rates
People often take less account of the prior 

odds (base-rate information) than they should 

according to Bayes™ theorem. 
Base-rate
 
infor-
mation
 was de˚ ned by Koehler (1996, p. 1) 

as, ﬁthe relative frequency with which an event 

occurs or an attribute is present in the popula-

tionﬂ. In the taxi-cab problem discussed above, 

Kahneman and Tversky (1972) found that most 

participants ignored the base-"
Segment_889,"rate information   about the relative numbers of Green and Blue   cabs. They focused only on the evidence of the   witness, and maintained there was an 80%   likelihood that the taxi was blue rather than   green. In fact, the correct answer based on   Bayes™ theorem is 41%. Here is another example o",Explores how attention influences cognition.,"attention, recognition, memory",Nested under Chapter on emotion,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in memory,Aligned with contemporary studies on emotion,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_389,"rate information 

about the relative numbers of Green and Blue 

cabs. They focused only on the evidence of the 

witness, and maintained there was an 80% 

likelihood that the taxi was blue rather than 

green. In fact, the correct answer based on 

Bayes™ theorem is 41%.
Here is another example of people failing 
to take account of base-rate information in the 

way they should according to Bayes™ theorem. 

Kahneman and Tversky (1973, p. 241) presented 

participants with the following description:
Jack is a 45-year-old man. He is married 

and has four children. He is generally 
versus X is not lying), and he showed how new 

data or information change the probabilities 

of each hypothesis being correct.
According to Bayes™ theorem, we need to 
assess the relative probabilities of the two 

hypotheses 
before
 the data are obtained (prior 
odds). We also need to calculate the relative 

probabilities of obtaining the observed data 

under each hypothesis (likelihood ratio). Bayesian 

methods evaluate the probability of observing 

the data, D, if hypothesis A is correct, written 

p
(D/ H
A
), and if hypothesis B is correct, written 
p
(D/ H
B
). Bayes™ theorem is expressed in the 
form of an odds ratio as follows:
p
(H
A
/ D) 
=
 
p
(H
A
) 
×
 
p
(D/H
A
)
p
(H
B
/ D) 
p
(H
B
) 
p
(D/H
B
)
The above formula may look intimidating 
and offputting, but is not really so (honest!). 

On the left side of the equation are the relative 

probabilities of hypotheses A and B in the light 

of the new data. These are the probabilities we 

want to work out. On the right side of the 

equation, we have the prior odds of each 

hypothesis being correct 
before
 the data were 

collected multiplied by the likelihood ratio 

based on the probability of the data given each 

hypothesis.
We can clarify Bayes™ theorem by consider-
ing the taxi-cab problem used by Kahneman 

and Tversky (1972). In this problem, a taxi-cab 

was involved in a hit-and-run accident one 

night. Of"
Segment_890,"the taxi-cabs in the city, 85% belonged   to the Green company and 15% to the Blue   company. An eyewitness identi˚  ed the cab as a  Blue cab. However, when her ability to identify   cabs under appropriate visibility conditions   was tested, she was wrong 20% of the time.   The participants had to",Explores how recognition influences cognition.,"perception, awareness, emotion",Nested under Chapter on emotion,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in memory,Aligned with contemporary studies on awareness,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_564," the taxi-cabs in the city, 85% belonged

Blue cab. However, when her ability to identify 

cabs under appropriate visibility conditions 

was tested, she was wrong 20% of the time. 

The participants had to decide the probability 

that the cab involved in the accident was Blue. 

Before proceeding, what is your answer to this 

problem?
The hypothesis that the cab was Blue is H
A
 
and the hypothesis that it was Green is H
B
. 
The prior probability for H
A
 is 0.15 and for 
H
B
 it is 0.85, because 15% of the cabs are blue 
and 85% are green. The probability of the 
base-rate information:

of an event within a population.

heuristic
. When people use this heuristic, 
ﬁEvents that are representative or typical of a 

class are assigned a high probability of occur-

rence. If an event is highly similar to most of 

the others in a population or class of events, 

then it is considered representativeﬂ (Kellogg, 

1995, p. 385).
The representativeness heuristic is used 
when people judge the probability that an 

object 
or event A belongs to a class or process 
B . Suppose you are given the description of 

an individual and estimate the probability he/

she has a certain occupation. You would pro-

bably estimate that probability in terms of the 

similarity
 between the individual™s description 

and your stereotype of that occupation. Indeed 

(the argument goes), you will do this even when 

it means ignoring other relevant information. 

That was precisely what happened in the study 

by Kahneman and Tversky (1973) discussed 

above. Participants focused on the fact that the 

description of Jack resembled the stereotype 

of an engineer and largely ignored the base-rate 

information.
Further "
Segment_891,"evidence indicating use of the  representativeness heuristic was reported by   Tversky and Kahneman (1983). They studied   the  conjunction fallacy,  which is the mistaken  belief that the conjunction or combination of   two events (A and B) is more likely than one   of the two events on its own. Th",Explores how perception influences cognition.,"perception, emotion, awareness",Nested under Chapter on awareness,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in recognition,Aligned with contemporary studies on awareness,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_558,"evidence indicating use of the

Tversky and Kahneman (1983). They studied 

the 
conjunction fallacy,
 which is the mistaken 
belief that the conjunction or combination of 

two events (A and B) is more likely than one 

of the two events on its own. This fallacy seems 

to involve the representativeness heuristic. 

Tversky and Kahneman used the following 

description:
Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken, 

and very bright. She majored in 
conservative, careful, and ambitious. 

He shows no interest in political and 

social issues and spends most of his free 

time on his many hobbies, which include 

home carpentry, sailing, and numerical 

puzzles.
The participants had to decide the prob-
ability that Jack was an engineer or a lawyer. 
They were all told that the description had 

been selected at random from a total of 100 

descriptions. Half of the participants were told 

70 of the descriptions were of engineers and 

30 of lawyers, and the other half were told 

there were descriptions of 70 lawyers and 30 

engineers. On average, the participants decided
 
that there was a 0.90 probability that Jack was 

an engineer regardless of whether most of the 

100 descriptions were of lawyers or of engineers.
 
Thus, participants took no account of the base-

rate information (i.e., the 70:30 split of the 

100 descriptions). If they had used base-rate 

information, the estimated probability that Jack 

was an engineer would have been less when 

the description was selected from a set of 

descriptions mainly of lawyers.
Heuristics and biases
Danny Kahneman and the late Amos Tversky 

have been the most in˜
 uential psychologists 
working in the area of human judgement. They 

have focused on explaining why we seem so 

prone to error on many judgement problems. 

They argued that we typically rely on simple 

heuristics (see Glossary) or rules of thumb when

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
Availability heuristic
Tversky and Kahneman (1974) argued that 
some judgement errors depend on use of the 

availability heuristic
. This heuristic involves 

estimating the frequencies of events on the basis 

of how easy or dif˚ cult it is to retrieve relevant  

information from long-term memory. For example, 

Lichtenstein, Slovic, Fischhoff, Layman, and 

Coombs (1978) asked people to judge the relative  

likelihood of different causes of death. Those 

causes of death attracting considerable publicity 

(e.g., murder) were judged more likely than those 

that do not (e.g., suicide), even when the opposite 

is the case. These ˚ ndings suggest that people 

used the availability heuristic.
Hertwig, Pachur, and Kurzenhäuser (2005) 
argued that we can interpret Lichtenstein et al.™s 

(1978) ˚ ndings in two ways. We can distinguish  

between two different mechanisms associated 

with use of the availability heuristic. First, there 

is the availability-by-recall mechanism: this is 

based on the number of people that an indi-

vid"
Segment_893,"ual recalls having died from a given risk   (e.g., a speci˚ c disease). Second, there is the   ˜  uency mechanism: this involves judging the  number of deaths from a given risk by deciding   how easy it would be to bring relevant instances   to mind but without retrieving them. Hertwig, Pachur, and",Explores how attention influences cognition.,"attention, awareness, recognition",Nested under Chapter on attention,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in memory,Aligned with contemporary studies on attention,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_967,"ual recalls having died from a given risk 

(e.g., a speci˚ c disease). Second, there is the 

˜
 uency mechanism: this involves judging the 
number of deaths from a given risk by deciding 

how easy it would be to bring relevant instances 

to mind but without retrieving them.
Hertwig, Pachur, and Kurzenhäuser (2005) 
used a task in which pairs of risks were presented 

and participants judged which claims more lives 

each year. Performance on this task was predicted 

moderately well by both mechanisms. Some 

individuals apparently used the availability-

by-recall mechanism most of the time, whereas 

others used it more sparingly.
Oppenheimer (2004) provided convincing 
evidence that we do not always use the avail-

ability heuristic. He presented American parti-

cipants with pairs of names (one famous, one 

non-famous), and asked them to indicate which 
philosophy. As a student, she was deeply 

concerned with issues of discrimination 

and social justice, and also participated 

in anti-nuclear demonstrations.
Participants rank ordered eight possible cat-

egories in terms of the probability that Linda 

belonged to each one. Three of the categories 

were bank teller
, feminist, and feminist bank 
teller
. Most participants ranked feminist bank 
teller as more probable than bank teller or 

feminist. This is incorrect, because
 all
 feminist 

bank tellers belong to the larger categories of 

bank tellers and of feminists!
We use the representativeness heuristic to judge 
the probability that an object or event A belongs 

to a class or process B. For example, you would 

estimate the probability that the woman in the 

picture has a certain occupation based on the 

similarity between her appearance and your 

stereotype of that occupation. You are more 

likely, for example, to state that she is a lawyer, 

than a Þ tness instructor.

AND DECISION MAKING 
503
It follows from support theory that the 
subjective probability of any given possibility 
will increase when it is mentioned explicitly 

and so becomes salient or conspicuous. Relevant 

evidence is discussed below.
Evidence
Mandel (2005) carried out a study during the 

˚
 rst week of the 2003 Iraq war. Some particip-
ants assessed the risk of at least one terrorist 

attack over the following six months, whereas 

others assessed the risk of an attack plotted by 

al Quaeda or not plotted by al Quaeda. The 

mean estimated probabilities were 0.30 for a 

terrorist attack, 0.30 for an al Quaeda attack, 

and 0.18 for a non-al Quaeda attack. Thus, 

as predicted by support theory, the overall 

estimated probability of a terrorist attack was 

greater (0.30 
+
 0.18 
=
 0.48) when the two 
major possibilities were made explicit than 

when they were not (0.30). Similar ˚
 ndings 
were reported by Rottenstreich and Tversky 

(1997). Estimates of the probability that an 

accidental death is due to murder were higher 

when different categories of murder were con-

sidered explicitly (e.g., by an acquaintance 

versus by a stranger).
We have seen that there is evidence for the 
phenomenon of higher subjective probability 

for an explicitly described event than for a less 

explicit one. We might imagine that experts 

would not show this phenomenon, since experts 

provided with a non-explicit description can 

presumably ˚ ll in the details from their own know-

ledge. However, Redelmeier, Koehler, Liberman,  

and Tversky (1995) found that expert doctors 

did
 show the effect. The doctors were given a 

description of a woman with abdominal pain. 

Half assessed the probabilities of two speci˚
 ed 
diagnoses (gastroenteritis and ectopic pregnancy) 

and of a residual category of everything else; t"
Segment_895,he   other half assigned probabilities to ˚  ve speci˚ ed  diagnoses (including gastroenteritis and ectopic   pregnancy). The key comparison was between   the subjective probability of the residual cat-  egory for the former group and the combined   probabilities of the three additional diagnoses,Explores how emotion influences cognition.,"awareness, perception, emotion",Nested under Chapter on memory,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in memory,Aligned with contemporary studies on emotion,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_415,"he 

other half assigned probabilities to ˚
 ve speci˚ ed 
diagnoses (including gastroenteritis and ectopic 

pregnancy). The key comparison was between 

the subjective probability of the residual cat-

egory for the former group and the combined 

probabilities of the three additional diagnoses 

plus the residual category in the latter group. 
surname was more common in the United States. 

For example, one pair consisted of the names 

ﬁBushﬂ and ﬁStevensonﬂ Œ which name do you 

think is more common? Here is another one: 

which surname is more common: ﬁClintonﬂ or 

ﬁWoodallﬂ? If participants had used the avail-

ability heuristic, they would have said ﬁBushﬂ 

and ﬁClintonﬂ. In fact, however, only 12% 

said Bush and 30% Clinton. They were correct 

to avoid these famous names because the non-

famous name is slightly more common.
How did participants make their judgements 
in the above study? According to Oppenheimer 

(p. 100), ﬁPeople not only spontaneously 

recognise when familiarity of stimuli comes 

from sources other than frequency (e.g., fame), 

but also overcorrect.ﬂ
Support theory
Tversky and Koehler (1994) put forward their 

support theory based in part on the availability 

heuristic. Their key assumption was that any 

given event will appear more or less likely 

depending on how it is described. Thus, we 
need 
to distinguish between events themselves and 

the descriptions of those events. You would 

almost certainly assume that the probability you 

will die on your next summer holiday is extremely 

low. However, it might seem more likely if you 

were asked the following question: ﬁWhat is 

the probability that you will die on your next 

summer holiday from a disease, a car accident, 

a plane crash, or from any other cause?ﬂ
Why
 is the subjective probability of death 
on holiday greater in the second case? According  

to support theory, a more explicit description 

of an event is regarded as having greater sub-

jective probabili"

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
(perhaps surprisingly) that intelligence or cog-
nitive ability is almost unrelated to performance 

on most judgement tasks. Stanovich and West 

(2008; see Chapter 14) found that performance 

on several tasks (e.g., Linda problem; framing 

problems; sunk-cost effect; the engineer/lawyer 

problem) was comparable in groups of more 

and less cognitively able students. These ˚
 ndings 
suggest that the heuristics-and-biases approach 

is generally applicable.
There are several limitations with the 
heuristics-and-biases approach. First, the term 

ﬁheuristicsﬂ is used in many different ways by 

different researchers and is in danger of losing 

most of its meaning. Shah and Oppenheimer 

(2008, p. 207) argued persuasively that, ﬁHeuristics 

primarily serve the purpose of reducing the 

effort associated with a taskﬂ, which is close 

to Kahneman and Tversky™s position. However, 

it has proved dif˚
 cult to move from using 
heuristics to describe certain phenomena to 

providing explanations of precisely 
how 
effort 
is reduced.
Second, some errors of judgement occur 
because participants misunderstand the problem. 

For example, between 20 and 50% of parti-

cipants interpret, ﬁLinda is a bank tellerﬂ, as 

implying that she is not active in the feminist 

movement. However, the conjunction fallacy 

is still found even when almost everything 

possible is done to ensure that participants do 

not mi"

However, that often seems unfair. For   example, Hertwig et al. (2005) found that most   people judged skin cancer to be a more common",Explores how perception influences cognition.,"awareness, attention, memory",Nested under Chapter on attention,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in awareness,Aligned with contemporary studies on perception,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_244,"sinterpret the problem (Sides, Osherson, 

Bonini, & Viale, 2002).
Third, the emphasis has been on the notion 
that people™s judgements are biased and error-

prone. However, that often seems unfair. For 

example, Hertwig et al. (2005) found that most 

people judged skin cancer to be a more common 

cause of death than cancer of the mouth and 

throat, whereas the opposite is actually the case. 

People make this ﬁerrorﬂ not because of in-

adequate thinking but simply because skin cancer 

has attracted considerable media coverage in 

recent years. We may make incorrect judgements 

because the available information is inadequate 

or because we process that information in a 

biased way. The heuristics-and-biases approach 

focuses on biased processing, but the problem 
Since both subjective probabilities cover the 

same range of diagnoses, they should have been 

the same. However, the former probability was 

0.50 but the latter was 0.69, indicating that 

subjective probabilities are higher for explicit 

descriptions even with experts.
Evaluation
The main predictions of support theory have 

often been supported with various tasks. Another 

strength of support theory is that it helps us 

to understand more clearly how the availability 

heuristic can lead to errors in judgement. It is 

also impressive (and somewhat surprising) that 

experts™ judgements are in˜ uenced by the expli-

citness 
of the information provided.
On the negative side, it is not very clear 
why people often overlook information that is 

well known to them. It is also not entirely clear 

why
 focusing on a given possibility typically 

increases its perceived support. Thus, the 
mech-
anisms
 underlying the obtained biases have not 

been identi˚ ed with any precision (Keren & 

Teigen, 2004).
Overall evaluation of heuristics-
and-biases approach
Kahneman and Tversky have shown that several 
general heuristics or rules of thumb (e.g., rep-

resentativeness heuristic; availability"
Segment_898,"heuristic)   underlie judgements in many different contexts.   They were instrumental in establishing the ˚  eld  of judgement research. The importance of this   research (and their research on decision making)   was shown in the award of the Nobel Prize to   Kahneman. Of greatest importance, Kahne",Explores how perception influences cognition.,"memory, attention, awareness",Nested under Chapter on attention,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in awareness,Aligned with contemporary studies on attention,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_993," heuristic) 

underlie judgements in many different contexts. 

They were instrumental in establishing the ˚
 eld 
of judgement research. The importance of this 

research (and their research on decision making) 

was shown in the award of the Nobel Prize to 

Kahneman. Of greatest importance, Kahneman 

and Tversky showed that people are surprisingly 

prone to systematic biases in their judgements 

even when experts are making judgements in 

their ˚ eld of expertise. Their ideas and research 

have in˜ uenced several disciplines outside of 

psychology, including economics, philosophy, 

and political science.
We might easily imagine that Kahneman 
and Tversky™s approach would be more appli-

cable to less intelligent individuals than to more 

intelligent ones. However, the evidence suggests

AND DECISION MAKING

you recognise both names. Then you think of 
another valid cue to city size, namely, that cities 

with cathedrals tend to be larger than those 

without. Accordingly, since you know that 

Cologne has a cathedral but are unsure about 

Herne, you produce the answer, ﬁCologneﬂ. 

In essence, the take-the-best strategy has three 

components:
Search rule
(1) 
: search cues (e.g., name recogni-
tion; cathedral) in order of validity.
Stopping rule
(2) 
: stop after ˚ 
nding a dis-
criminatory cue (i.e, the cue applies to 

only one of the possible answers).

Decision rule
(3) 
: choose outcome.
The most researched example of the take-
the-best strategy is the 
recognition
 
heuristic,
 
which is as follows: ﬁIf one of two objects is 

recognised and the other is not, infer that the 

recognised object has the higher value with 

respect to the criterionﬂ (Goldstein & Gigerenzer, 
2002, p. 76). In the example above, if you
 
recognise the name ﬁCologneﬂ but not ﬁHerneﬂ, 

you guess (correctly) that Cologne is the larger 

city and i"

Goldstein and   Gigerenzer made the strong (and controversial)   claim that, when individuals recognise one   object but not the other, no other information   in˜  uences the decision.

Why might people use the recognition 
and take-the-best heuristics? First, it is claimed 

from an evolutionary perspective that humans 

have to use valid cues to make certain kinds of 

decision. Second, these heuristics often produce 

accurate predictions. For example, Goldstein 

and Gigerenzer (2002) reported correlations 

of 
+
0.60 and 
+
0.66 in two studies between the 
number of people recognising a city and its 

population. Third, no judgement process would

mation (Juslin, Winman, & Hansson, 2007).
Fourth, many people make correct or 
approximately accurate judgements. This is 

hard to explain within the heuristics-and-

biases 
app 
roach, which tends to emphasise 
the de˚ ciencies of human judgement although 

accepting that heuristics and biases can be 

moderately useful. Later in the chapter, we will 

discuss a theoretical approach (the dual-process 

model) that addresses this issue.
Fifth, much of the research is arti˚
 cial and 
detached from the realities of everyday life. As 

a result, it is hard to generalise from laboratory 

˚
 ndings. For example, emotional and motiva-
tional factors play a role in the real world 

but were rarely studied in the laboratory until 

recently. For example, Lerner, Gonzalez, Small, 

and Fischhoff (2005) 
carried out an online 

study immediately after 
the terrorist attacks 

of 11 September 2001. 
The participants were 

instructed to focus on aspects of the attacks 

that made them afraid, angry, or sad. The key 

˚
 nding was that the estimated probability of 
future terrorist attacks was higher in fearful 

participants than in sad or angry ones.

relatively little information. It is assumed that 

we possess an ﬁadaptive toolboxﬂ consisting 

of several such heuristics.
One of the key fast-and-frugal heuristics 
is the take-the-best heuristic or strategy. This 

is based on ﬁtake the best, ignore the restﬂ. 

We can illustrate use of this strategy with the 

concrete example of deciding whether Herne

size is that cities whose names you recognise

whose names you don™t recognise. However,

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
with cities in their own country, and so they 
could not use the recognition heuristic.
The recognition heuristic is less important 
than claimed by Goldstein and Gigerenzer 

(2002). Oppenheimer (2003) asked participants  

to decide whether recognised cities known to 

be small were larger than unrecognised cities. 

The small cities were relatively close to Stanford 

University where the study took place and the 

unrecognised cities were ˚
 ctitious but sounded 
plausible (e.g., Las Besas; Rio Del Sol). The 

recognition heuristic failed to predict the results: 

the recognised city was judged to be larger on 

only 37% of trials. Thus, knowledge of city 

size can override the recognition heuristic.
Is there 
anything
 special about the recog-
nition heuristic? Pachur and Hertwig (2006) 

argued that there is. Retrieving the familiarity

rapidly and automatically than retrieving any 

other kind of information about an object. 

That gives it a ﬁcompetitive edgeﬂ over other 

information. Pachur and Hertwig asked 

participants to decide which in each of several 

pairs of infectious diseases is more prevalent 

in Germany. This is a dif˚ cult test for the theory 

because some very rare diseases (e.g., cholera; 

leprosy) are almost always recognised. There 

were two main ˚ ndings. First, the recognition 

heuristic was only used in 62% of cases in which 

it could have been used, because participants 

realised that recognition was not a very valid 

cue. Second, response times for decisions con-

sistent with use of the recognition heuristic 

were 20% faster than those inconsistent with 

its use.
In a second experiment, Pachur and Hertwig 
(2006) used the same task but instructed 

participants to respond within 900 ms. This 

time pressure caused participants to produce 

more decisions consistent with the recognition 

heuristic than in the ˚rst experiment (69% 

versus 62%, respectively).
The take-the-best strategy is not used as 
often as predicted theoretically. Newell, Weston, 

and Shanks (2003) asked participants to choose 

between the shares of two ˚
 ctitious companies 
on the basis of various cues. Only 33% of the 
take less time or be less cognitively demanding 

than the recognition heuristic.
Evidence
Evidence that the recognition heuristic is impor-

tant was reported by Goldstein and Gigerenzer 

(2002). American students were presented with 

pairs of German cities and decided which of 

the two was the larger. When only one city name  

was recognised, participants used the recogni-

tion heuristic 90% of the time. In another study, 

Goldstein and Gigerenzer told participants that 

German cities with football teams tend to be 

larger than those without football teams. When  

participants decided whether a recognised city

than an unrecognised city, participants used the 

recognition heuristic 92% of the time. Thus, 

as predicted theoretically, they mostly ignored 

the con˜ icting information about the absence 

of a football team.
Richter and Späth (2006) pointed out that 
participants in the above study may have ignored 

information about the presence or absence 

of a football team because they felt it was 

not strongly related to city size. They carried 

out a 
similar study in which German students 
decided which in each pair of American cities 

was larger. For some recognised cities, the 

students were told that it had an international 

airport, whereas for others they were told that 

it did not. The recognised city was chosen 98% 

of the time when it had an international airport 

but only 82% of the time when it did not. Thus, 

the recognition heuristic was often not used 

when the participants had access to inconsistent 

information. Presumably this happened because 

they believed that presence or absence of an 

international airport is a valid cue to city size.
Goldstein and Gigerenzer (2002) presented 
American and German students with pairs of 

American cities and pairs of German cities, and 

asked them to select the larger city in each pair. 

The ˚ ndings were counterintuitive: American 

and German students performed 
less
 well on 

cities in their own country than on those in the 

other country. This occurred because students 

typically recognised both members in the pair

p.188) admitted, ﬁThere is the large question

which kept us arguing days and nights. . . . Which 

homunculus [tiny man inside our heads] selects

Natural frequency hypothesis
Gigerenzer and Hoffrage (1995, 1999) put 

forward an evolutionary account of the strengths 

and weaknesses of human judgements. Their 

account relies heavily on the notion of 
natural 

sampling
, which is ﬁthe process of encountering 

instances in a population sequentiallyﬂ (Gigerenzer  

& Hoffrage, 1999, p. 425). Natural sampling 

is what generally happens in everyday life. It 

is assumed that as a result of our evolutionary 

history we ˚ nd it easy to work out the 
frequen-
cies
 of different kinds of event. In contrast, 

we ˚ nd it very dif˚ cult to deal with fractions 

and percentages.
It follows that most people ignore base 
rates and make other mistakes on judgement 

problems because these problems involve 

percentages and other complex statistics. The 

central prediction is that performance would 

improve greatly if the problems used natural 

frequencies. We will shortly discuss relevant 

research. Before doing so, note that some 

distinctions are unclear in this theoretical 

approach. For example, the emphasis in the 

theory is on the ﬁnaturalﬂ or objective frequen-

cies of certain kinds of event. Such frequencies 

can undoubtedly provide potentially valuable 

information when making judgements. However, 

in the real world, we actually encounter only a  

sample of events, and the frequencies of various 

events in this sample may be selective and very 

different from natural or objective samples 

(Sloman & Over, 2003). For example, the fre-

quencies of highly intelligent and less intelligent  
participants conformed to all three components 

of the take-the-best strategy. They often failed 

to stop searching for information after ˚
 nding 
a discriminatory cue. U"

Newell et al. found that the take-the-best 
strategy 

was least likely to be used when the cost of

Bröder (2003) pointed out that individual 
differences have often been ignored. He used 

a task involving choosing between shares. More 

intelligent participants were 
more likely than 
less 
intelligent ones to use the take-the-best 
strategy  
when it was the best one to use.
Evaluation
People sometimes use fast-and-frugal heuristics  

such as the recognition heuristic and the take-

the-best strategy to make rapid judgements. 

These heuristics can be surprisingly effective 

in spite of their simplicity, and it is impressive 

that individuals with little knowledge can some-

times outperform those with greater knowledge. 

Familiarity or recognition information can be 

accessed faster and more automatically than 

other kinds of information. This encourages 

its widespread use when individuals are under 

time or cognitive pressure, and explains why 

the recognition heuristic is used sometimes.
The approach based on fast-and-frugal 
heuristics has several important limitations. First, 

the major fast-and-frugal heuristics are used 

much less often than predicted theoretically (e.g., 

Newell et al., 2003; Oppenheimer, 2003).
Second, some heuristics are by no means 
as simple as Gigerenzer and others have claimed. 

For example, to use the take-the-best heuristic, 

it is necessary to organise the various cues 

hierarchically in terms of their validity (Newell,  

2005). This is a very complex task, and there 

is not much evidence indicating that we have 

good knowledge of cue validities.
Third, when the approach is applied to 
decision making, it de-emphasises the impor-

tance of the decision in question. Decision 

making may well stop after a single discrimina-

tory cue has been found when deciding which 

is the larger of two cities. However, most "

and 
active feminists. The percentage of particip-
ants showing the conjunction fallacy dropped 
dramatically with the frequency version (see 

Figure 13.1). Performance may have been better 

with the frequency version because people are 

more used to dealing with frequencies than 

with probabilities. Alternatively, it may be 

that the frequency version makes the problem™s 

structure more 
obvious.
Hoffrage, Lindsey, Hertwig, and Gigerenzer 
(2000) gave advanced medical students four 

realistic diagnostic tasks containing base-rate 

information presented in a probability version 

or a frequency version. These experts paid 

little attention to base-rate information in the 

probability versions. However, they performed 

much better when given the frequency versions 

(see Figure 13.2).
Fiedler, Brinkmann, Betsch, and Wild (2000) 
tested the theoretical assumption that base 

rates are taken much more into account when 
people encountered by most university students 

are likely to be very different from the frequencies 

in the general population.
It is also important to distinguish between 
natural frequencies and the word problems 

actually used in research. In most word prob-

lems, participants are simply provided with 

frequency information and do not have to 

grapple with the complexities of natural 

sampling.
Evidence
Judgement performance is often much better 

when problems are presented in the form of 

frequencies rather than probabilities or per-

centages. For example, Fiedler (1988) used the 

Linda problem discussed earlier. The standard 

version was compared to a frequency version 

in which participants indicated how many

Thus, the improved performance found when 
judgement tasks are presented in frequency 

formats may not occur because people are 

naturally equipped to think about frequencies 

rather than about probabilities.
Third, the natural frequency hypothesis 
is narrowly based. Its emphasis on natural 

frequencies means it is unable to explain why 

people perform well on some judgement tasks 

involving probabilities (see next section). As 

we will see, the accuracy of judgements depends 

very much on whether people can make use of 

their intuitive causal knowledge, a factor totally 

ignored by the natural frequency hypothesis.
Causal models
According to the heuristics-and-biases approach 

and the natural frequency hypothesis, most 

people™s judgements are generally inaccurate. 

These views led Glymour (2001, p. 8) to ask 

the question, ﬁIf we™re so dumb, how come 

we™re so smart?ﬂ Krynski and Tenenbaum 

(2007) addressed that question with respect 

to ˚
 ndings apparently showing that people 
consistently ignore (or fail to make suf˚
 cient 
use of) base-rate information. They argued that 

we possess very valuable 
causal
 
knowledge
 that  
allows us to make successful judgements in the 

real world (this issue is explored in detail by 

S"

In the laboratory, however, 

the judgement problems we confront often fail 

to provide such knowledge. Many of these 

judgement problems make it dif˚ cult for people 

to match the statistical information provided 

with their intuitive causal knowledge.
We can see what Krynski and Tenenbaum 
(2007) mean by causal knowledge by discussing 

one of their experiments. Some of the parti-

cipants were given the following judgement 

task (the false positive scenario), which closely 

resembles those used previously to show how 

people neglect base rates:
The following statistics are known about 

women at age 60 who participate in a 

routine mammogram screening, an X-ray 

of the breast tissue that detects tumours: 
frequencies are sampled. They used the following 

problem in various forms. There is an 80% 

probability that a woman with breast cancer 

will have a positive mammogram compared 

to a 9.6% probability that a woman without 

breast cancer will have a positive mammogram.
 
The base rate of cancer in women is 1%. The 

task is to decide the probability that a woman 

has breast cancer given a positive mammogram
 
(the correct answer is 7.8%).
Fiedler et al. (2000) did not give particip-
ants the problem in the form described above, 

because they were interested in people™s sam-

pling behaviour when allowed to make their 

own choices. Accordingly, they provided some 

participants with index card ˚
 les organised 
into the categories of women with breast cancer 

and those without. They had to select cards, 

with each selected card indicating whether the 

woman in question had had a positive mammo-

gram. The key ˚ nding was that participants™ 

sampling was heavily 
biased
 towards women 

with breast cancer. As a result, the participants 

produced an average estimate of 63% that 

a woman had breast cancer given a positive 

mammogram (remember the correct answer 

is 7.8%).
Evaluation
There are two major apparent strengths of the "
Segment_908,"theoretical approach advocated by Gigerenzer   and Hoffrage (1995, 1999). First, it makes sense   to argue that use of natural or objective sampling   could enhance the accuracy of many of our   judgements. Second, as we have seen, judgements   based on frequency information are often super-  ior",Explores how awareness influences cognition.,"attention, perception, recognition",Nested under Chapter on awareness,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in recognition,Aligned with contemporary studies on awareness,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_583,"

could enhance the accuracy of many of our 

judgements. Second, as we have seen, judgements

The natural sampling hypothesis has several 
limitations. First, there is often a yawning chasm 

between people™s actual sampling behaviour 

and the neat-and-tidy frequency data provided 

in laboratory experiments. As Fiedler et al. 

(2000) found, the samples selected by particip-

ants can provide biased and complex information 

which is very hard to interpret.
Second, frequency versions of problems 
nearly always make their underlying structure 

much easier to grasp (Sloman & Over, 2003).

cyst scenario were far more likely to take full 
account of the base-rate information than were 

those given the standard false positive scenario. 

Krynski and Tenenbaum (2007) argued that 

the reasonably full causal knowledge available 

to participants given the benign cyst scenario 

corresponds to real life. For example, suppose 

a friend of yours has a cough. You know a cough 

can be caused by a common cold as well as by 

lung cancer. You use your base-rate knowledge 

that far more people have colds than lung cancer 

to make the judgement that it is highly probable 

that your friend is only suffering from a cold.
We discussed Kahneman and Tversky™s 
(1972) taxi-cab problem earlier. They found 

that most of their participants ignored the base-

rate information about the numbers of green 

and blue cabs. Krynski and Tenenbaum (2007) 

argued that this happened because it was hard 

for participants to see the causal structure of 

the task. They devised a new version of"
Segment_909,"this task.   This version was very similar to the standard   one except that  reasons  why the witness might   have made a mistake were spelled out. Here is   the crucial addition to the problem: When testing a sample of cabs, only   80% of the Blue Co. cabs appeared blue   in colour, and only 80%",Explores how awareness influences cognition.,"awareness, memory, attention",Nested under Chapter on awareness,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in recognition,Aligned with contemporary studies on emotion,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_325," this task. 

This version was very similar to the standard 

one except that 
reasons
 why the witness might 

have made a mistake were spelled out. Here is 

the crucial addition to the problem:
When testing a sample of cabs, only 

80% of the Blue Co. cabs appeared blue 

in colour, and only 80% of the Green 
Co. cabs appeared green in colour
. Due 
to faded paint, 20% of Blue Co. cabs 

appeared green in colour, and 20% of 

Green Co. cabs appeared blue in colour.
2% of women have breast cancer at 

the time of screening. Most of them 

will receive a positive result on the 

mammogram. There is a 6% chance 

that a woman without breast cancer 

will receive a positive result on the 

mammogram. Suppose a woman at age 

60 gets a positive result during a routine 

mammogram screening. Without 

knowing any other symptoms, what are 

the chances she has breast cancer?
The base rate of cancer in the population was 

often neglected by participants given this task. 

According to Krynski and Tenenbaum (2007), 
this happened because having breast cancer 

is the 
only
 cause of positive mammograms 
explicitly mentioned in the problem. Suppose 

we re-worded the problem slightly to indicate 

clearly that there is an alternative cause of 

positive mammograms. Krynski and Tenenbaum 

did this by changing the wording of the third 

paragraph:
There is a 6% chance that a woman 

without breast cancer will have a dense 

but harmless cyst that looks like a 

cancerous tumour and causes a positive 

result on the mammogram.

that they can be used almost regardless of the 
amount of information we have available. In 

contrast, complex cognitive strategies are of 

very limited usefulness when information is 

sparse. Third, it may simply be that we don™t 

like thinking hard if we can avoid it. Fourth, 

in a rapidly changing world it may not make 

much sense to devote considerable effort to 

making very precise judgements.
In spite of the above points, individuals 
do sometimes use complex cognitive processes 

rather than heuristics. This led various theorists 

(e.g., Evans & Over, 1996; Sloman, 1996) to 

propose dual-process models. Kahneman (2003)  

and Kahneman and Frederick (2002, 2005, 

2007) proposed one such model, according 

to which probability judgements depend on 

processing within two systems:
System 1
: This system is intuitive, auto-
matic, and immediate. More speci˚
 cally,
ﬁThe operations of System 1 are typically

fast, automatic, effortless, associative, implicit

[not open to introspection] and often

emotionally charged; they are also dif˚
 cult
to control or modifyﬂ (Kahneman, 2003).

Most heuristics are produced by this

system.

System 2
: This system is more analytical,
controlled, and rule-governed. According

to Kahneman (2003), ﬁThe operations of

System 2 are slower, serial [one at a time],

effortful, more likely to be consciously

monitored and deliberately controlled; they

are also relatively ˜
 
exible and potentially
rule-governed.ﬂ
What is the relationship between these two
systems? According to Kahneman and Frederick 

(2002), System 1 rapidly generates intuitive 

answers to judgement problems. These intuitive 

answers are then monitored or evaluat"
Segment_911,"ed by   System 2, which may correct them. According   to Kahneman and Frederick (2005, p. 274),   however, we often make little or no use of   System 2: ﬁPeople who make a casual intuitive   judgement normally know little about how   their judgement came about.ﬂ Only 8% of participants showed base-r",Explores how emotion influences cognition.,"memory, attention, recognition",Nested under Chapter on attention,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in emotion,Aligned with contemporary studies on attention,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_1101,"ed by 

System 2, which may correct them. According 

to Kahneman and Frederick (2005, p. 274), 

however, we often make little or no use of 

System 2: ﬁPeople who make a casual intuitive 

judgement normally know little about how 

their judgement came about.ﬂ
Only 8% of participants showed base-rate 
neglect with the faded paint version compared 

to 43% with the standard version. Correct 

answers increased from 8% with the standard 

version to 46% with the faded paint version. 

Thus, many people are very good at using base-

rate information provided they understand 

the causal factors responsible for the statistical 

information they are given.
Evaluation
Krynski and Tenenbaum (2007) have identi-

˚
 ed important reasons why the judgements we 
make in everyday life are generally more accur-

ate than those made with arti˚
 cial problems 
under laboratory conditions. More speci˚
 cally, 
they have shown that it is relatively easy to 

persuade people to make use of base-rate infor-

mation. According to them, ﬁPeople™s physical, 

biological, and social environments are causally 

structured, and their intuitive theories of the 

world are often Œ but not always Œ suf˚
 cient 
to capture the most relevant structures for 

enabling appropriate causal Bayesian inferencesﬂ 

(p. 449).
There are two limitations with this theor-
etical approach. First, even when the underlying 

causal structure was made explicit, fewer than 

50% of participants produced the correct 

answer. Thus, there is more to solving judge-

ment problems than having access to explicit 

causal information. Second, and related to 

the ˚ rst point, there are important individual 

differences in performance on judgement prob-

lems. However, Krynski and Tenenbaum do not 

identify these individual differences.
Dual-process model
Most people seem to rely heavily on heuristics 

or rules of thumb when making judgements.

Heuristic processing based on stereotypes 
(System 1 processing) would produce answer 

(a), whereas consideration of the base rate  

(System 2) would produce the correct answer 

(b). De Neys and Glumicic also used 
congruent
 
problems in which the description of the person 

and the base-rate information both pointed 

to the same answer. Finally, there were some 

neutral problems in which the description of 

the person bore no obvious relationship to group 

membership, and so System 2 processing was 

needed to obtain the correct answer.
In their ˚ rst experiment, De Neys and 
Glumicic (2008) asked their participants to 

think out loud while dealing with each problem. 

As expected, most participants failed to use 

base-rate information with incongruent prob-

lems. As a result, their performance was much 

worse with those problems than with congruent  

ones (under 20% versus 95%, respectively). 

Participants doing incongruent problems only 

referred to base-rate information on 18% of 

trials, suggesting that they generally ignored 

such information at the conscious level.
In their second experiment, participants 
were not required to think aloud during perfor-

mance of the problems. As before, performance 

was much worse with incongruent than with 

congruent problems (22% versus 97%, respec-

tively). The most interesting ˚
 ndings related 
to time taken with each type of problem (see 

Figure 13.4). Participants took longer to pro-

duce answers with incongruent problems than 

with congruent or neutral ones, whether their 

a"

What do the ˚ ndings of De Neys and 
Glumicic (2008) mean? On the face of it, they 

seem inconsistent. When participants think 

aloud, there is little evidence that they consider 

base-rate information. However, the fact that 

they took longer to respond with incongruent 

than with congruent problems indicates that 

base-rate information in˜ uenced their behaviour. 

The most likely explanation is that base-rate 

information was mostly processed below the 
Evidence
Kahneman (2003) discussed evidence relating 

to the dual-process model. Since System 2 is 

more cognitively demanding than System 1, 

it would be predicted that highly intelligent 

individuals would make more use of it than 

would those less intelligent. Evidence reviewed 

by Kahneman supported that prediction.
De Neys (2006a) carried out several experi-
ments to test the dual-process model. Participants 

were presented with the Linda problem and 

another very similar problem involving the 

conjunction fallacy. Participants who obtained 

the correct answers (and so presumably used 

System 2) took almost 40% longer than those 

who used only System 1. This is consistent 

with the assumption that it takes longer to use 

System 2. De Neys also compared performance 

on the same problems performed on their own 

or at the same time as a demanding secondary 

task (tapping a complex novel sequence) involv-

ing use of the central executive. Participants 

performed worse on the problems when accom-

panied by the secondary task (9.5% correct 

versus 17%, respectively). This is as predicted, 

given that use of System 2 requires use of 

cognitively demanding processes.
De Neys and Glumicic (2008) tested the 
dual-process model in several experiments 

investigating base-rate neglect. There were some

However, De Neys and Glumicic (2007) found 
more evidence for processing of base-rate infor-

mation than predicted by the model. Second, 

the model is not very explicit about the precise 

processes involved in judgement. For example, 

what is involved in monitoring and detecting 

problems with the answer suggested by System 

1? Third, the model is basically a 
serial
 one, 

with use of System 1 preceding use of System 2.  

However, several theorists favour the notion of 

parallel
 processing, with both systems operating 

at the same time (see Evans, 2007, for a review). 

At present, there is no compelling evidence to 

support the serial view over the parallel one.
DECISION MAKING
Life is full of decisions. Which movie will I 

go to see tonight? Would I rather go out with 

Nancy or Sue? What career will I pursue? Who 

will I share a ˜ at with next year? It is important 

to understand how we decide what to do. At 

one time, it was assumed that people behave 

rationally, and so select the best option. This 

assumption was built into normative theories, 

which focused on how people should make

existence of two different processing systems 

corresponding to those assumed within the

The notion that people™s judgements 
are typically determined by System 1 rather 

than by System 2 is in accord with most of the 

data. In addition, it provides an explanation 

for individual differences in judgement perfor-

mance. Individuals who make extensive use of 

System 2 processing will perform better than 

those who use only System 1. Finally, note that 

there is much support for other versions of the 

dual-process model (e.g., those put forward by 

Evans and Over, 1996, and Sloman, 1996).
What are the limitations of the dual-process 
model? First, it is based on the assumption that  

most people rely almost exclusively on System 1.

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
BASIC DECISION MAKING
What factors are involved in simple or basic 
decision making? As we will see, several theories 

have been put forward in the attempt to provide 

an answer to that question. Some theories 

focus mainly on cognitive factors of relevance 

to decision making, and we will start by con-

sidering perhaps the most in˜
 uential of such 
theories. However, there has been an increasing 

acceptance that other factors are also "
Segment_916,"very impor-  tant. We will subsequently discuss theoretical   approaches that emphasise either emotional or   social factors. Prospect theory Much of the time we engage in risky decision   making Œ there is uncertainty about the con-  sequences of making a decision. As a ˚  rst  approximation, it se",Explores how recognition influences cognition.,"attention, memory, emotion",Nested under Chapter on attention,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in awareness,Aligned with contemporary studies on perception,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_1293,"very impor-

tant. We will subsequently discuss theoretical 

approaches that emphasise either emotional or 

social factors.
Prospect theory
Much of the time we engage in risky decision 

making Œ there is uncertainty about the con-

sequences of making a decision. As a ˚
 rst 
approximation, it seems reasonable to assume 

that we make decisions so as to maximise the 

chances of making a gain and minimise the 

chances of making a loss. Suppose someone 

offered you $200 if a tossed coin came up 

heads and a loss of $100 if it came up tails. 

You would jump at the chance (wouldn™t you?), 

given that the bet provides an average expected 

gain of $50 per toss.
Here are two more decisions. Would you 
prefer a sure gain of $800 or an 85% probability  

of gaining $1000 and a 15% probability of 

gaining nothing? Since the expected value of 

the latter decision is greater than that of the 

former decision ($850 versus $800, respectively), 

you might well choose the latter alternative. 

Finally, would you prefer to make a sure loss 

of $800 or an 85% probability of losing $1000 

with a 15% probability of not incurring any 

loss? The average expected loss is $800 for the 

former choice and $850 for the latter one, so 

you go with the former choice don™t you?
The ˚ rst problem was taken from Tversky 
and Sha˚
 r (1992) and the other two problems 
came from Kahneman and Tversky (1984). In 

all three cases, most participants did 
not
 make 

what appears to be the best choice. Two-thirds 

of participants refused to bet on the toss of a 
decisions while de-emphasising how they 

actually make them. For example, consider the 

views of von Neumann and Morgenstern (1947). 

Their utility theory was not a psychological 

theory of decision making. However, they sug-

gested that it is possible that we try to maximise  

utility
, which is the subjective value we attach 

to an outcome. When we need to choose between 

simple options, we assess the expected utili"
Segment_917,ty   or expected value of each one by means of the   following formula: Expected utility  =  (probability of  a given outcome)  ×  (utility of the   outcome) One of the important contributions of von  Neumann and Morgenstern (1947) was to treat   decisions as if they were gambles. As Manktelow   (19,Explores how emotion influences cognition.,"awareness, memory, perception",Nested under Chapter on recognition,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in recognition,Aligned with contemporary studies on awareness,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_1353,"ty 

or expected value of each one by means of the 

following formula:
Expected utility 
=
 (probability of 
a given outcome) 
×
 (utility of the 

outcome)
One of the important contributions of von 
Neumann and Morgenstern (1947) was to treat 

decisions as if they were gambles. As Manktelow 

(1999) pointed out, this approach was sub-

sequently coupled with Savage™s (1954) math-

ematical approach based on using information 

from people™s preferences to combine subjective 

utilities and subjective probabilities. This led 

to the development of subjective expected 

utility theory.
In the real world, various factors are gener-
ally associated with each option. For example, 

one holiday option may be preferable to another 

because it is in a more interesting area and 

the weather is likely to be better. However, the 

˚
 rst holiday is more expensive and more of 
your valuable holiday time would be spent 

travelling. In such circumstances, people are 

supposed to calculate the expected utility or 

disutility (cost) of each factor to work out 

the overall expected value or utility of each 

option. In fact, people™s choices and decisions 

are often decided by factors other than simple 

utility.
Decisions obviously differ enormously in 
their complexity. It is more dif˚ cult to decide 

what to do with your entire life than to decide 

which brand of cereal to have for breakfast. 

We will start with relatively simple decision 

making in the sense that relatively little infor-

mation needs to be considered. After that, we 

will consider more complex decision making.

In contrast, 

the negative value associated with losses increases

How does prospect theory account for the 
˚
 ndings discussed earlier? If people are much 
more sensitive to losses than to gains, they should 

be unwilling to accept bets involving potential 

losses even though the potential gains outweigh 

the potential losses. They would also prefer a 

sure gain to a risky but potentially greater gain.  

Finally, note that prospect theory does 
not
 predict 
that people will always avoid risky decisions. 

If offered a chance of avoiding a loss (even if it  

means the average expected loss increases from 

$800 to $850), most people will take that chance 

because they are so concerned to avoid losses.
Two further predictions follow from pros-
pect theory. When people make decisions, they 
coin, and a majority preferred the choice with 

the smaller expected gain and the choice with 

the larger expected loss!
Kahneman and Tversky (1979, 1984) devel-
oped prospect theory in an attempt to under-

stand such apparently paradoxical ˚
 ndings. 
Two of the main assumptions of this theory 

are as follows:
Individuals identify a reference point gen-
(1) 
erally representing their current state.

Individuals are much more sensitive to 
(2) 
potential losses than to potential gains; 

this is 
loss aversion
. This explains why 

most people are unwilling to accept a 

50 Œ50 bet unless the amount they might 

win is about twice the amount they might 

lose (Kahneman, 2003).
Both of these assumptions are shown in 

Figure 13.5. The reference point is where the 
Most people are more sensitive to possible 
losses than to possible gains. As a result of this 

loss aversion, they are unwilling to bet on the 

toss of a coin unless the potential gains are 

much greater than the potential losses.

more likely than others to show loss aversion. 
Josephs, Larrick, Steele, and Nisbett (1992) 

asked individuals high and low in self-esteem 

to choose between two options differing in risk 

(e.g., a certain gain of $8 versus a 66% chance 

of winning $12). Those low in self-esteem were 

64% more likely than those high in self-esteem 

to choose the sure gain in one experiment, and 

the difference was 78% in a replication.
In another experiment, Josephs et al. (1992) 
asked participants to choose one out of ˚
 ve 
gambles. The least risky gamble gave a 95% 

chance of winning $2.10 and the riskiest one 

gave a 25% chance of winning $8. The ˚
 ndings 
are shown in Figure 13.6. High self-esteem 

individuals were ten times more likely to select 

the riskiest than the least risky gamble, whereas 

almost twice as many low self-esteem indi-

viduals chose the least risky gamble than the 

riskiest one.
Why is self-esteem so important? According 
to Josephs et al. (1992), individuals high in 

self-esteem have a strong self-protective system 

that helps to maintain self-esteem when con-

fronted by threat or loss. In contrast, people with 

low self-esteem are concerned that negative or 

threatening events will reduce their self-esteem.
It could be argued that most research on 
loss aversion is of limited applicability because 

the amounts of money that can be won or lost 

are relatively modest. However, the television 

game show ﬁDeal or no dealﬂ provides a way of  

testing prospect theory in a situation involving 

very large potential gains. Detailed examination 

of performance on this show provides mixed

A phenomenon resembling loss aversion is the 

sunk-cost effect
, which is ﬁa greater tendency t o  
attach 
more
 weight to low-probability events 
than those events merit according to their 

actual probability of occurrence. That helps to 

explain why people bet on the National Lottery, 

where the chances of winning the jackpot 

are approximately 1 in 14 million. In contrast, 

high-probability events receive 
less
 weight than 
they deserve.
Evidence
According to subjective expected utility theory 

and other normative theories, everyone should 

adhere to the 
dominance principle
, according 

to which, ﬁIf Option A is at least as good as 

Option B in all respects and better than B in 

at least one aspect, then A should be preferred 

to Bﬂ (Gilhooly, 1996, p. 178). However, as 

predicted by prospect theory, that is not what 

happens. Kahneman and Tversky (1984) used 

a problem similar to one described above. 

Participants had to make two decisions, the 

˚
 rst of which involved choosing between:
(A) a sure gain of $240
(B) a 25% probability of gaining 
$1000 and a 75% probability of 

gaining nothing.
The second decision involved choosing 
between:
(C) 
a sure loss of $750
(D) a 76% probability of losing 
$1000 and a 24% probability of 

losing nothing.
According to the dominance principle, the 
participants should have chosen B and C over 

A and D. Options B and C together offer a 

25% probability of gaining $250 and a 75% 

probability of losing $750, whereas options A 

and D together offer a 24% probability of 

gaining $240 and a 76% probability of losing 

$760. In fact, 73% of the participants chose 

A and D, whereas only 3% chose B and C; 

thus, participants showed loss aversion.
Prospect theory does not focus on indi-
vidual differences, but some people are much 
dominance principle:
 in decision making, the 
notion that the better of two similar options 

will be preferred.

and various species of animal (e.g., blackbirds, 
mice) are much less affected than adult humans  

by the sunk-cost effect (Arkes & Ayton, 1999). 

This may seem surprising because we regard 

ourselves (with some justi˚ cation!) as much 

smarter than birds and mice. However, other 

species do not feel the need to justify their 

decisions to other members of the same species.
Much research has involved the 
framing 
effect
, in which decisions are in˜
 uenced by 
irrelevant aspects of the situation. In a classic 

study, Tversky and Kahneman (1987) used the 

Asian disease problem. Some participants were 

told there was likely to be an outbreak of an 

Asian disease in the United States, and it was 

likely to kill 600 people. Two programmes of 

action had been proposed: Programme A would 

allow 200 people to be saved; programme 

B would have a one-third probability that 

600 people would be saved and a two-thirds 
continue an endeavour once an investment in 

money, effort, or time has been madeﬂ (Arkes 

& Ayton, 1999, p. 591). This effect is captured 

by the expression ﬁthrowing good money after 

badﬂ. Dawes (1988) discussed a study in which 

participants were told that two people had paid 

a $100 non-refundable deposit for a weekend 

at a resort. On the way to the 
resort, both of  

them became slightly unwell, and fel t th ey  
would 
probably have a more pleasurable time at home 

than at the resort. Should they drive on or turn 

back? Many participants argued that the two 

people should drive on to avoid wasting the 

$100 Œ this is the sunk-cost effect. This decision 

involves extra expenditure (
money spent at the  

resort versus staying at home) 
and is less pre-
ferred than being at home!

told that the group size was 600, six, or three 

patients unknown to them, or six patients who 

were close relatives of the participant. The

sion was greatly in˜ uenced by group size and  

by the relationship between the participants

the probabilistic option with small group size 

(especially for relatives) probably occurred 

because the social context and psychological 

factors relating to fairness were regarded as more 

important in those conditions. These ˚
 ndings 
are inconsistent with utility theory. According 

to this theory, the participants should always 

have chosen the de˚ nite survival of two-thirds 

of the patients rather than a one-third probability 

of all patients surviving.

differences among those making decisions? 
pro 
bability that none of the 600 would be 
saved. 
When the issue was expressed in this form, 
72% of the participants favoured programme A, 

although the two programmes (if implemented 

several times) would on average both lead to 

the saving of 200 lives.
Other participants in the study by Tversky 
and Kahneman (1987) were given the same 

problem, but this time it was negatively framed. 

They were told that programme A would lead 

to 400 people dying, whereas programme B 

carried a 1:3 probability that nobody would 

die and a 2:3 probability that 600 would die. 

In spite of the fact that the number of people 

who would live and die in both framing condi-

tions was identical, 78% chose programme B.
The various ˚ ndings can be accounted for 
in terms of loss aversion, i.e., people are moti-

vated to avoid certain losses. However, since 

the problem remained basically the same whether 

framed positively or negatively, the prediction 

from subjective expected utility theory is that 

framing should have no effect.
According to prospect theory, framing 
effects should only be found when what is at 

stake has real value for the decision maker: 

loss aversion does not apply if you do not mind  

incurring a loss. There is much support for 
this 
prediction (e.g., Bloom˚ eld, 2006; Wang, Simons,

Evaluation
Prospect theory provides a much more adequate 
account of decision making than previous nor-

mative approaches such as subjective expected 

utility theory. The value function (especially 

the assumption that people attach more weight 

to losses than to gains) allows us to explain many 

phenomena (e.g., loss aversion; sunk-cost effect; 

framing effects) not readily explicable by sub-

jective expected utility theory. Even clearer 

evidence supporting prospect theory and dis-

proving subjective expected utility theory has 

come from studies showing failures of the 

dominance principle.
Prospect theory has various limitations. 
First, Kahneman and Tversky failed to provide 

a detailed explicit rationale for the value function. 

As a result, prospect theory gives only a partial 

explanation. Second, the theory does not 

emphasise the effects of social and emotional 

factors on decision making (e.g., Wang, 1996; 

see below). Third, individual differences in 

willingness to make risky decisions (e.g., Josephs 

et al., 1992) are de-emphasised. Fourth, framing 

effects depend on characteristics of decision 

makers as well as on whether the message is 

positively or negatively framed (e.g., Moorman 

& van den Putte, 2008). Fifth, there is some-

times an underweighting of the probability of 

rare events (e.g., Jessup et al., 2008).

Much of this research lies within

, 
Evidence that the answer is, ﬁYesﬂ, was reported 

by Moorman and van den Putte (2008). They 

used two smoking cessation messages, one with 

a negative frame and the other with a positive 

frame. The negative frame worked better among 

smokers whose quitting intentions were high, 

whereas the positive frame worked better 
among 

those whose quitting intentions were low.  
Thus, 
framing effects depend on the recipient ofthe 

message as well as on whether the message i s  

positively or negatively framed.
According to prospect theory, people over-
weight the probability of rare events when 

making decisions. This prediction has been 

supported in several studies (see Hertwig, Barron, 

Weber, & Erev, 2004, for a review). However, 

Hertwig et al. argued that we should distin-

guish between decisions based on descriptions 

and those based on experience. In the laboratory,  

people are typically provided with a neat sum-

mary description of the possible outcomes and 

their associated probabilities. In contrast, in 

the real world, people often make decisions 

(e.g., to go out on a date) purely on the basis 

of personal experience.
Hertwig et al. (2004) compared decision 
making based on descriptions with decision 

making based on experience (i.e., personal 

observation of events and their outcomes). When 

decisions were based on descriptions, people 

overweighted the probability of rare events as 

predicted by prospect theory. However, when 

decisions were based on experience, people 

underweighted the probability of rare events, 

which is opposite to theoretical prediction. This 

happened in part becaus"

Jessup, Bishara, and Busemeyer (2008)

When no feedback was provided, participants

However, the provision of feedback eliminated 

this effect and led to a small 
underweighting
 

of the probability of rare events. Thus, feedback 

may act as a ﬁreality checkﬂ that eliminates 

the bias of overweighting the probability of 

rare events.

who lost felt happier than they had predicted 
at both time intervals, and the actual impact 

on happiness of losing $3 was no greater than 

the actual impact of gaining $5. Why did this 

happen? Participants who had lost $3 focused 

much more on the fact that they nevertheless 

˚
 nished with a pro˚ t of $2 than they had pre-
dicted beforehand.
De Martino, Kumaran, Seymour, and 
Dolan (2006) found that brain areas associated 

with emotion were relevant to the framing effect. 

Activation in the amygdala and the orbital and 

medial prefrontal cortex was associated with 

greater frame effects and so greater evidence of 

loss aversion. Since these areas are associated 

with anxiety, it is possible that anxiety caused 

increased loss aversion.
Wong, Yik, and Kwong (2006) argued that 
emotional factors are involved in the sunk-cost 

effect, in which good money is thrown after 

bad. The initial undesirable outcome (e.g., loss 

of money) creates negative affect (e.g., anxiety).

Rick, & Cohen, 2008, for a review).
Loss aversion
Emotions often ful˚ l a valuable function, but 

can lead us to be excessively and unrealistically 

averse to loss. Kermer, Driver-Linn, Wilson, 

and Gilbert (2006) carried out an experiment 

in which some participants (experiencers) 
played  
a gambling game in which on each trial a 

computer ranked playing-card suits from ˚
 rst 
to last. The task was to guess which suit would 

be ranked ˚ rst, and money was won or lost 

depending on the computer™s ranking of the 

selected suit. Things were arranged so that 

some participants ˚ nished with a pro˚ t of $4, 

whereas others made a loss of $4. Other par-

ticipants (forecasters) watched the win or the 

loss version of the game. At 30-second intervals 

after the end of the game, experiencers rated 

how happy they were, and forecasters predicted 

how happy they would have been if they had 

played the game.
The ˚ ndings from this ˚ rst experiment are 
shown in Figure 13.8. Forecasters in the loss 

condition showed a greater change in happiness 

from baseline than did forecasters in the gain 

condition, thus showing loss aversion. However, 

the key ˚ nding was that experiencers in the 

loss condition were 
not
 signi˚
 cantly less happy 
than experiencers in the gain condition. Thus, 

people 
overestimate
 the intensity and duration 
of their negative emotional reactions to loss 

(compare the loss forecasters with the loss ex-

periencers). This phenomenon (impact bias) 

has also been found with respect to predictions 

about losses such as losing a job or a romantic 

partner (see Kermer et al., 2006, for a review).

13 JUDGEMENT 
AND DECISION MAKING 
521
Can brain damage improve decision making?
Some of the most important research within 
neuroeconomics was reported by Shiv et al. 

(2005a, 2005b).Their starting point was the 

assumption that emotions can make us exces-

sively cautious and risk averse.That led them 

to the counterintuitive prediction that brain-

damaged patients would outperform healthy 

participants on a gambling task provided the brain 

damage reduced their emotional experience.
There were three groups of participants in 
the study by Shiv, Loewenstein, Bechara, Damasio, 

and Damasio (2005a). One group consisted 

of patients with brain damage in areas related 

to emotion (amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, and 

insular or somatosensory cortex).The other 

groups consisted of patients with brain damage 

in areas unrelated to emotion and healthy con-

trols. Initially, Shiv et al. provided participants 

with $20. On each of 20 rounds, they decided 

whether to invest $1. If they did, they lost the 

$1 if a coin came up heads but won $1.50 if it 

came up tails. Participants stood to make an 

average gain of 25 cents per round if they 

invested compared to simply retaining the $1. 

Thus, the optimal strategy for proÞ t maximis"
Segment_929,"a-  tion was to invest on every single round. The patients with damage to emotion regions   invested in 84% of the rounds compared to   only 61% for the other patient group and 58%   for the healthy controls.Thus, the patients with   restricted emotions performed best.Why was   this?The patients wit",Explores how emotion influences cognition.,"emotion, memory, awareness",Nested under Chapter on memory,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in recognition,Aligned with contemporary studies on attention,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_423,"a-

The patients with damage to emotion regions  
invested in 84% of the rounds compared to 

only 61% for the other patient group and 58% 

for the healthy controls.Thus, the patients with 

restricted emotions performed best.Why was 

this?The patients with brain damage unrelated 

to emotion and the healthy controls were much 

less likely to invest following loss on the 
previous 
round than following gain. In contrast, patients 

with brain damage related to emotion were 

totally unaffected in their investment decisions 

by the outcome of the previous round (see 

Figure 13.9).
Shiv, Loewenstein, and Bechara (2005b) 
compared patients with damage to emotion 

regions, patients with substance dependence 

(e.g., cocaine; alcohol), and healthy controls on 

the gambling task.They used patients with sub-

stance dependence because they generally have 
damage to parts of the brain involved in emotion. 

The two patient groups had a comparable level 

of performance, and both groups earned more 

money than did the healthy controls.
What can we conclude? As Shiv et al. (2005a, 
2005b) argued, there is a Òdark sideÓ to emotions 

when it comes to decision making.  An emotion 

such as anxiety can prevent us from maximising 

our proÞ t by making us excessively concerned 

about possible losses and therefore excessively 

afraid of taking risks. However, it is not clear 

whether the performance of the substance-

dependent patients occurred because of damage 

to the emotion system or because risk-takers 

are more likely than other people to become 

substance-dependent.

simulation that stock investors who experienced 
more intense feelings had superior decision-

making performance than those with less intense 

feelings. Perhaps the relevant expertise of the 

participants made it easier for them to prevent 

their emotional states from biasing their decision 

making. Patients with damage to the ventro-

medial 
prefrontal cortex typically have essentially 
intact intelligence but are very de˚
 cient in 
expressing and experiencing emotions (Bechara 

& Damasio, 2005). These patients often have 

very poor decision making in real life (e.g., 

they repeatedly make decisions that lead to 

negative consequences).
Omission bias and decision avoidance
There is other evidence that emotional and 

social factors not included within prospect 

theory in˜ uence decision making. Ritov and 

Baron (1990) told participants to assume their 

child had ten chances in 10,000 of dying from 

˜
 u during an epidemic if he/she wasn™t vaccin-
ated. They were told the vaccine was certain 

to prevent the child from catching ˜ u, but had 

potentially fatal side effects. Ritov and Baron 

found that ˚
ve deaths per 10,000 was the 
average maximum acceptable risk participants 

were willing to tolerate in order to decide to 

have their child vaccinated. Thus, people would 

choose not to have their child vaccinated when 

the likelihood of the vaccine causing death was 

much lower than the death rate from the disease 

against which the vaccine protects!
What was going on in the study by Ritov 
and Baron (1990)? The participants argued 

they would feel more responsible for the death 

of their child if it resulted from their own 

actions rather than their inaction. This is an

An important factor   in omission bias is anticipated regret, with the  more likely than those low in neuroticism to   withdraw from the situation and thus avoid the   sunk-cost effect.

et al. found.
In sum, there is much evidence (including 
brain-imaging studies and studies on brain-

damaged patients) that emotional factors play 

an important role in loss aversion. More spe-

ci˚
 cally, emotional states (perhaps especially 
anxiety) lead individuals to become more loss 

averse. This research is helping to clarify why 

most individuals are more sensitive to losses 

than to gains.

ences. For example, Samuelson and Zeckhauser 

(1988) found that in a real-life situation many 

people kept the same allocation of retirement 

funds year after year even when they would 

not have incurred any costs by changing.
RationalŒemotional model
Anderson (2003) put forward a rationalŒ

emotional model to account for the impact of 

emotions on decision making (see Figure 13.10). 

Decision making is determined by rational 

factors based on inferences and outcome infor-

mation, as well as experienced and anticipated 

emotion. The two key emotions within the

There have been several studies in which 
omission bias was not found (see Baron & 

Ritov, 2004, for a review). Baron and Ritov 

obtained evidence that may help to explain the 

apparently inconsistent ˚ ndings. Even though 

there was an overall omission bias, some parti-

cipants showed the opposite bias. Baron and 

Ritov termed this ﬁaction biasﬂ and argued 

that those susceptible to it are applying the

In the medium-accountability 
condition, parti-

cipants were told that the amount o f  
information 
provided should be suf˚ cient to allow a good 

decision to be made.
Simonson and Staw™s (1992) ˚
 ndings are 
shown in Figure 13.11. The tendency towards 

a sunk-cost effect was strongest in the high-

accountability condition and lowest in the 

low-accountability condition. Presumably, parti-

cipants in the high-accountability condition 

experienced the greatest need to justify their 

previously ineffective course of action (i.e., 

fruitless investment in one type of beer) by 

increasing their commitment to it.
We might assume that medical experts 
would be more likely to make sound and un-

biased decisions when held accountable for their 

actions. This assumption was discon˚
 rmed by 
model are regret (as in omission bias) and fear. 

Fear can be reduced when an individual decides 

not to make a decision for the time being. The 

essence of the model is as follows: ﬁIt is reason-

able to assume that 
people make choices that 
reduce negative emotionsﬂ (p. 142).
The model can account for some of the 
phenomena discussed earlier. For example, one 

reason for loss aversion is the effect of anticipated 

regret at the possibility of making a decision 

that might produce losses.
Social functionalist approach
Much research designed to test subjective utility 

theory and prospect theory is laboratory-based. 

However, there are major differences between 

the laboratory and real life, because laboratory 

decisions have no interpersonal consequences. 

This led Tetlock (2002) to propose a social func-

tionalist approach taking account of the social 

context of decision making. For example, people 

often behave like intuitive politicians, in that, 

ﬁThey are accountable to a variety of constitu-

to create desired impressions on key constituen-

cies, and their long-term success at managing 

impressions hinges on their skill at anticipating 

objections that others are likely to raise to 

alternative courses of actionﬂ (p. 454). Thus, 

people acting as intuitive politicians need to 

be able to justify their decisions to others.
Evidence
Simonson and Staw (1992) investigated the 

effects of accountability on decision making 

in a study on the sunk-cost effect. Participants 

were given information about a beer company 

selling light beer and non-alcoholic beer. They 

were asked to recommend which product should 

receive an additional $3 million for marketing 

support (e.g., advertising). They were then told 

that the president of the company had made 

the same decision, but this had produced dis-

appointing results. Finally, they were told the 

company had decided to allocate $10 million 

of additional marketing support which could 

be divided between the two products.

13 JUDGEMENT 
AND DECISION MAKING 
525
COMPLEX DECISION 
MAKING
So far we have focused mainly on decision 
making applied to fairly simple problems. In 

real life, however, we are often confronted 

by important decisions. For example, medical 

experts have to make diagnostic decisions that 

can literally be a matter of life or death (see 

Chapter 12). Other decisions are both impor-

tant and complex (e.g., Shall I marry John?; 

Shall I move to Australia?). How do we deal 

with such decisions?
Before proceeding to discuss theory and 
research on decision "
Segment_935,"making, an important   point needs to be made. As Hastie (2001, p. 665)   pointed out, ﬁMost current decision theories   are designed to account for the choice of one   action at one point in time. The image of a   decision maker standing at a choice point like   a fork in a road and choosing one di",Explores how perception influences cognition.,"recognition, attention, emotion",Nested under Chapter on perception,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in awareness,Aligned with contemporary studies on recognition,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_844,"making, an important 

point needs to be made. As Hastie (2001, p. 665) 

pointed out, ﬁMost current decision theories 

are designed to account for the choice of one 

action at one point in time. The image of a 

decision maker standing at a choice point like 

a fork in a road and choosing one direction or 

the other is probably much less appropriate 

for major everyday decisions than the image 

of a boat navigating a rough sea with a sequence 

of many embedded choices and decisions to 

maintain a meandering course toward the ulti-

mate goal.ﬂ Thus, decision making in everyday 

life is typically much more complex than under 

laboratory conditions.
According to multi-attribute utility theory 
(Wright, 1984), a decision maker should go 

through the following stages:
Identify attributes relevant to the decision.
(1) 
Decide how to weight those attributes.
(2) 
Obtain a total utility (i.e., subjective desir-
(3) 
ability for each option by summing its 

weighted attribute values).

Select the option with the highest weighted 
(4) 
total.
We can see how multi-attribute utility theory 
works in practice by considering someone
 
deciding which ˜
 at to rent. First, consideration 
is paid to the relevant attributes (e.g., number 

of rooms; location; rent per week). Second, the 

relative utility of each attribute is calculated. 
Schwartz, Chapman, Brewer, and Bergus (2004). 

Doctors were told about a patient with osteo-

arthritis for whom many anti-in˜
 ammatory drugs 
had proved ineffective. In the two-option con-

dition, they chose between simply referring the 

patient to an orthopaedic specialist to discuss 

surgery or combining referral with prescribing 

an untried anti-in˜ ammatory drug. In the three-

option condition, there were the same options 

as in the two-option condition plus referral 

combined with prescribing a different untried 

anti-in˜
 ammatory drug. The doctors simply 
made their decisions or were made accountable

The doctors showed a bias in their decision   making regardless of whether they were made   accountable. They were  more  likely to select   the referral-only option in the three-option than   the,Explores how attention influences cognition.,"awareness, emotion, recognition",Nested under Chapter on emotion,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in recognition,Aligned with contemporary studies on memory,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_870,"ons (they wrote an explanation 

for their decision and agreed to be contacted 

later to discuss it).
The doctors showed a bias in their decision  
making regardless of whether they were made 

accountable. They were 
more
 likely to select 

the referral-only option in the three-option than 

the two-option condition, which is contrary 

to common sense. This bias was signi˚
 cantly 
greater when doctors were made accountable 

for their decisions. What is going on here? In 

the three-option condition, it is very hard to 

justify selecting one anti-in˜
 ammatory drug over 
the other one. The easy way out is to select the 

remaining option (i.e., referral only).
Evaluation
The central assumption that most decision mak-

ing is in˜ uenced by social context has attracted 

much support. We feel a need to justify our 

decisions to other people as well as to ourselves, 

causing us to behave like intuitive 
politicians. 

Overall, the social functionalist approach empha-

sises important factors de-
emphasised within 
prospect theory.
There are some limitations with the social 
functionalist approach. First, important factors 

(e.g., our greater sensitivity to losses than to 

gains) are ignored. Second, there are large indi-

vidual differences in the extent to which people 

feel the need to justify themselves to other 

people, but these individual differences are 

ignored. Third, most of the relevant research 

has involved laboratory tasks not making any 

real demands on social responsibility.

Third, the various ˜ ats being considered are

the person chooses the one with the highest 

total utility.
Decision makers who adopt the above 
approach will often make the best decision 

provided that 
all
 the options are listed and the 

criteria are independent of each other. However, 

there are various reasons why people rarely 

adopt the above decision-making procedure in 

real life. First, the procedure can be very com-

plex. Second, the set of relevant dimensions 

cannot always be worked out. Third, the dimen-

sions themselves may not be clearly separate 

from each other.
Bounded rationality
Herb Simon (1957) put forward a much more 

realistic approach to complex decision making. 

He started by distinguishing between unbounded 

rationality and bounded rationality. Within 

models of unbounded rationality, it is assumed 

that all relevant information is available for use 

(and is used) by decision makers. The basic 

notion is that we engage in a process of 
opti-

misation,
 in which the best choice or decision 

is made. There are two problems with the 

notion of optimisation. First, as Klein (2001, 
Hastie (2001) likened 
decision making to Ò.  .  .  a

buying a house may ˚ rst of all consider the 
attribute of geographical location, eliminating 

all those houses not lying within a given area. 

They may then consider the attribute of price, 

eliminating all properties costing above a cer-

tain ˚ gure. This process continues attribute by 

attribute until only one option remains. The 

limitation with this approach is that the option 

selected varies as a function of the order in which 

the attributes are considered. As a result, the 

choice that is made may not be the best one.
Evidence
Payne (1976) carried out a study to see the extent 

to which decision makers actually use the vari-

ous strategies we have discussed. Participants 

decided which apartment to rent on the basis 

of information about various attributes such 

as rent, cleanliness, noise level, and distance 

from campus, all of which were presented on 

cards. The number of apartments varied between 

two and 12 and the number of attributes 

between four and 12. When there were many 

apartments to consider, participants typically 

started by using a simple strategy such as 

satis˚
 cing or elimination-by-aspects. When only 
a few apartments remained to be considered, 

there was often a switch to a more complex 

strategy corresponding to the assumptions of 

multi-attribute utility theory.
It was assumed within multi-attribute utility 
theory that a given individual™s assessment of 

the utility or preference of any given attribute

of ˚t or match between the mind and the 

environment. According to Simon (1990, p. 7), 

ﬁHuman rational behaviour is shaped like a 

scissors whose blades are the structure of task 

environments and the computational capabil-

ities of the actor.ﬂ If we consider only one blade 

(i.e., the task environment or the individual™s 

abilities), we will have only a partial under-

standing of how we make decisions. In similar 

fashion, we would be unable to understand how 

scissors cut if we focused on only one blade.
Simon (1978) argued that bounded ration -
ality is shown by the heuristic known as 

satis˚
 cing. The essence of
 satis˚
 cing
 (formed 
from the words satisfactory and suf˚
 cing) is 
that individuals consider various options one 

at a time and select the ˚rst one meeting their 

minimum requirements. This heuristic isn™t 

guaranteed to produce the best decision, but 

is especially useful when the various options 

become available at different points in time. 

An example would be the vexed issue of deciding 

who to marry. Someone using the satis˚
 cing 
heuristic would set a minimum acceptable level, 

and the ˚ rst person reaching (or exceeding) that 

level would be chosen. If the initial level of 

acceptability is set too high, the level is adjusted 

downwards. Of course, if you set the level too 

low, you may spend many years bitterly regretting 

having used the satis˚
 cing heuristic!
Schwartz, Ward, Monterosso, Lyubomirsky, 
White, and Lehman (2002) distinguished between 

satis˚
 cers (content with making reasonably good 
decisions) and maximisers (perfectionists). There

optimistic than maximisers, they had greater 

life satisfaction, and they experienced less regret 

and self-blame. Thus, constantly striving to make

Tversky (1972) put forward a theory of 
complex decision making resembling Simon™s 

approach. According to Tversky™s elimination-

by-aspects theory, decision makers eliminate 

options by considering one relevant attribute 

or aspect after another. For example, someone 
satis˚
 cing:
 selection of the Þ rst choice meeting 
certain minimum requirements; the word is 
formed from the words ÒsatisfactoryÓ and 

ÒsufÞ cingÓ.

Tversky™s (1972) elimination-by-aspects theory. 
However, the actual reduction seems smaller 

than would be expected according to that 

theory.
We would expect experts to make better 
decisions on average than non-experts. Is their 

superior performance entirely due to greater 

knowledge or does their processing on decision-

making tasks differ from that of non-experts? 

Evidence that there may be important differ-

ences in processing was discovered by Klein 

(1998). Experts (e.g., ˚ re commanders; military 

commanders) tended to consider only one option 

at a time, whereas Galotti (2007) found this 

was rare among non-experts. Experts generally 

rapidly categorised even a novel situation as 

an example of a type of situation with which 

they were familiar, and then simply retrieved the 

appropriate decision from long-term memory.
Similar ˚
 ndings to those of Galotti (2007) 
have been found in studies on medical expertise 

(see Chapter 12). Perhaps surprisingly, medical 

experts are sometimes more prone to error 

than non-experts (e.g., Reyna & Lloyd, 2006; 

see Chapter 12). Earlier in the c"

that also shows that experts™ decision making 

can be error prone. Doctors who had to decide 

what should be done with a patient suffering 

from osteoarthritis had biased decision making. 

This bias was greater when they were made 

accountable for their decision.
Fellows (2006) addressed the issue of which 
parts of the brain are especially important in 

decision making. Patients with damage to the 

ventromedial frontal lobe, others with damage 

to other parts of the frontal lobe, and healthy 

controls were given the task of selecting an 

apartment when presented with information 

concerning several aspects of each one. Healthy 

controls and patients without damage to the 

ventromedial frontal lobe compared attribute 

information across several apartments. In con-

trast, patients with damage to the ventromedial 

frontal lobe focused their search for informa-

tion around individual apartments. The ˚
 ndings 
suggest that the ability to compare information 

across different options (which is very important 
was preferable to the other on two attributes 

and inferior on two attributes. Participants 

assessed their preferences. They were then told 

that one of the jobs was in a much better loca-

tion than the other, which often tipped the 

balance in favour of choosing the job in the 

better location. The participants then re-assessed 

their preference for each option. Preferences for 

desirable attributes of the chosen job increased 

and preferences for undesirable attributes of that 

job decreased, thus disproving the assumption 

from multi-attribute utility theory.
Russo, Carlson, and Meloy (2006) found 
more evidence of non-rational decision making. 

Many participants were persuaded to choose 

an inferior restaurant (based on information 

they had previously provided) by the simple 

expedient of initially presenting positive infor-

mation about it. Thus, installing the inferi"

Galotti (2007) discussed ˚ ve studies con-
cerned with important real-life decisions (e.g., 

students choosing a college; college students 

choosing their main subject). There were several 

˚
 ndings. First, decision makers constrained the 
amount of information they considered, focusing 

on between two and ˚
 ve options (mean 
=
 four) 
at any given time. Second, the number of options 

considered decreased over time. Third, the 

number of attributes considered at any given 

time was between three and nine (mean 
=
 six). 

Fourth, the number of attributes did not decrease  

over time; sometimes it actually increased. 

Fifth, individuals of higher ability and/or more 

education tended to consider more attributes. 

Sixth, most of the decisions makers™ real-life 

decisions were assessed as good.
What can we conclude from Galotti™s (2007) 
study? The most striking ˚ nding is that people 

consistently limit the amount of information 

(options and attributes) they consider. This is 

inconsistent with multi-attribute utility theory 

but is precisely as predicted by Simon™s (1957) 

notion of bounded rationality. In addition, 

Galotti found that the number of options con-

sidered decreased by 18% over a period of 

several months. A reduction is predicted by

Most human complex decision making differs 

from the ideal in two major ways. First, we 

typically focus on only some of the available 

information because of our limited ability to 

process and remember information. Second, 

some aspects of our decision making can be 

regarded as somewhat irrational. For example,

behaviour is consistent with the notion of

least approximately by Tversky™s elimination-

by-aspects theory.
Unconscious thought theory
It is often assumed that conscious thinking is 

more effective than unconscious thinking with 

complex decision making, whereas unconscious  

thinking (if useful at all) is so with respect to 

simple decision making. However, Dijksterhuis 

and Nordgren (2006) argued that precisely 

the opposite is actually the case! How did they 

support that argument? First, they claimed that 

conscious thought is constrained by the limited 

capacity of consciousness, whereas the uncon-

scious has considerably greater capacity. Second, 

ﬁThe unconscious naturally weights the relative 

importance of various attributes. Conscious 

thought often leads to suboptimal weighting 

because it disturbs this natural process.ﬂ 
However, 
only conscious thought can follow strict rules 

and so provide precise answers to complex 

mathematical problems.
Evidence
Betsch, Plessner, Schwieren, and Gütig (2001) 

obtained evidence that the unconscious can 

successfully integrate large amounts of informa-

tion. Participants were shown advertisements  

on a computer screen, and instructed to look 

carefully at them. At the same time, detailed 
information about increases and decreases 

in the prices of ˚ ve hypothetical shares was 

presented. Participants were subsequently asked 

speci˚
 c questions about the shares. Their per-
formance was very poor, indicating a lack of 

conscious awareness of information about the 

shares. However, participants were able to use 

gut feeling to identify the best and worst shares, 

suggesting that unconscious processes integrated  

information about the shares.
Dijksterhuis (2004) used the same three 
conditions in three different expe"
Segment_944,"riments on   decision making. In the control condition, parti-  cipants made immediate decisions as soon as   the various options had been presented. In the   conscious thought condition, participants had   a few minutes to think about their decision. In   the unconscious thought condition, particip",Explores how attention influences cognition.,"perception, attention, memory",Nested under Chapter on perception,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in recognition,Aligned with contemporary studies on recognition,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_254,"riments on 

decision making. In the control condition, parti-

cipants made immediate decisions as soon as 

the various options had been presented. In the 

conscious thought condition, participants had 

a few minutes to think about their decision. In 

the unconscious thought condition, participants 

were distracted for a few minutes to prevent 

conscious thinking about the problem, and 

then made their decision.
The ˚ ndings were similar in all three ex-
periments, and so we will consider only one 

a t  length. Participants received detailed informa-

tion about four hypothetical apartments in 

Amsterdam. Each apartment was described in 

terms of 12 attributes, and the task was to select 

the best apartment. Performance was best in 

the unconscious thought condition and worst 

in the control condition (see Figure 13.12). Far 

more of those in the unconscious thought 

condition than the conscious thought condition 

indicated they had made a global judgement 

(55.6% versus 26.5%, respectively). This sug-

gests that the relatively poor performance in the 

conscious thought condition occurred because 

participants focused too much on a small frac-

tion of the information. Since the attribute 

information was not visually available while 

they contemplated their decision, they were 

constrained by the limitations of memory.
We have seen that unconscious thought can 
lead to superior decisions to conscious thought 

when decision making is complex. According 

to unconscious thought theory, there should 

be an 
interaction 
between mode of thought 
and complexity of decision making. Since con-

scious thought has limited capacity, it is well

Evaluation
Unconscious thought theory advances our 

understanding of the strengths (and limitations) 

of unconscious thought relative to conscious 

thought. The greatest advantages of unconscious 

thought are its very large capacity and its rapid 

weighting of the relative importance of different 

pieces of task-relevant information. However, 

these characteristics are disadvantageous when 

it is very important to attend to (and select) 

certain information while ignoring and discard-

ing other information, and tasks on which the 

answer needs to be precise.
The evidence supports the notion that con-
scious thought is constrained by the limitations  

of attention and consciousness. However, sev-

eral of Dijksterhuis™ experiments undersell the 
suited to simple decision making but can some-

times become ineffective as decision making 

becomes more complex. Supportive ˚
 ndings 
were reported by Dijksterhuis, Bos, Nordgren, 

and van Baaren (2006). All the participants 

read information concerning four hypothetical 

cars. In the simple condition, each car was 

described by four attributes. In the complex 

condition, each car was described by 12 attri-

butes. Participants either spent four minutes 

thinking about the cars (conscious thought 

condition) or solved anagrams for four minutes 

before choosing a car (unconscious thought 

condition).

 Introduction
† 
There are close relationships between the areas of judgement and decision making. 

Decision-making research covers all of the processes involved in deciding on a course of 

action. In contrast, judgement research focuses mainly on those aspects of decision making 

concerned with estimating the likelihood of various events. In addition, judgements are 

evaluated in terms of their accuracy, whereas decisions are evaluated on the basis of their 

consequences.
 Judgement 
research
† 
In everyday life, our estimates of the probability of something often change in the light 

of new evidence. In making such estimates, people (even experts) often fail to take full 

account of base-rate information. One reason why people fail to make proper use of 

base-rate information is because of their reliance on the representativeness heuristic. Our 

judgement errors also depend on use of the availability heuristic. According to support 

theory, the subjective probability of an event increases as the description of the event 

becomes more explicit and detailed. The take-the-best and recognition heuristics are very 

simple rules of thumb that are often surprisingly accurate but are used less often than 

predicted theoretically by Gigerenzer
. An advantage of the recognition heuristic is that it 
can be used rapidly and automatically. Gigerenzer and Hoffrage argue"
Segment_948,"that judgements are   more accurate when based on natural sampling and frequencies rather than probabilities.

However, people often adopt biased sampling strategies, and are inaccurate even when 

using frequency data. According to Krynski and Tenenbaum (2007), we possess very 

valuable causal knowledge that allows us to make successful judgements in the real world. 

According to the dual-process model, probability judgements can involve an intuitive 

system (System 1) that often makes use of heuristics or a more conscious and controlled 

system (System 2).

Basic decision making
†
According to prospect theory, people are much more sensitive to potential losses than to

potential gains. As a result, they are willing to take risks to avoid losses. The theory is

supported by the sunk-cost and framing effects. Prospect theory is not very explicit about

the role of emotional factors in decision making. Individuals overestimate the intensity

and duration of their negative emotional reactions to loss. Reduced loss aversion (and

superior performance) on a gambling task is shown by patients with damage to brain

areas involved in emotion. According to Anderson™s rationalŒemotional model, decision

making is in˜ 
uenced by anticipated regret and fear. The model helps to explain the omission
and status quo biases. According to Tetlock™s social functionalist approach, people often

behave like intuitive politicians who need to justify their decisions to others.
Complex decision making
†
Complex decision making involves bounded rationality, meaning that we are constrained
by our limited processing ability. Tversky™s elimination-by-aspects theory is consistent

with the notion of bounded rationality. There is evidence from major real-life decisions

that people consistently limit the amount of information they consider. Medical experts

process less information and make more extreme decisions than non-experts when engaged

in decision making. According to Dijksterhuis™ unconscious thought theory, unconscious

thinking is more useful than conscious thinking with complex decision making, but the

opposite is the case with simple decision making. However, conscious thinking is more

valuable than the theory suggests.

Finally in this chapter, we consider informal

at the apparently wide chasm between everyday 

reasoning in the form of argumentation and 

the highly artiÞ cial reasoning tasks used in the 

laboratory. That has led to the emergence of 

research on informal reasoning designed to 

focus on the processes used in most everyday 

reasoning.
Bear in mind that processes over and above 
reasoning are used by participants given 

reasoning problems to solve. As Sternberg (2004, 

p. 444) pointed out, ÒReasoning is not encapsu-

lated [enclosed or isolated]. It is part and parcel 

of a wide array of cognitive functions . . . many 

cognitive processes, including visual perception, 

contain elements of reasoning in themÓ.
INTRODUCTION
For hundreds of years, philosophers have 

distinguished between two different kinds of 

reasoning. One is 
inductive reasoning
, which 

involves making a generalised conclusion from 

premises (statements) referring to particular 

instances. A key feature of inductive reasoning 

is that the conclusions of inductively valid 

arguments are probably (but not necessarily) 

true. According to Karl Popper (1968), hypo-

theses can never be shown to be logically 

true by simply generalising from 
conÞ
 rming 
instances (i.e., induction). As the philosopher 

Bertrand Russell pointed out, a scientist turkey 

might form the generalisation, ÒEach day I am 

fedÓ, because this hypothesis has been conÞ
 rmed 
every day of its life. However, the generalisation  

provides no 
certainty
 that the turkey will be 

fed tomorrow. Indeed, if tomorrow is Christmas 

Eve, it is likely to be proven false.
The other kind of reasoning is deductive 
reasoning.

For example, if we assume that Tom is taller

the conclusion that Tom is taller than Harry 

is necessarily true. Deductive reasoning is related  

to problem solving, because people trying to 

solve a deductive-reasoning task have a deÞ
 nite 
goal and the solution is not obvious. However, 

deductive-reasoning problems differ from other 

kinds of problem in that they often owe their 
inductive reasoning:
 forming generalisations 
(which may be probable but are not certain) 

from examples or sample phenomena.

deductive reasoning:
 reasoning to a conclusion  

from some set of premises or statements, where 

that conclusion follows necessarily from the 

assumption that the premises are true.

 involves the attempt 
to obtain evidence that will conÞ rm the correct-
ness of oneÕs hypothesis. In contrast, 
falsiÞ
 cation
 
involves the attempt to falsify hypotheses by 

experimental tests. According to Popper, it is 

impossible to achieve conÞ rmation via hypo-

thesis testing. Even if all the evidence accumu-

lated so far supports a hypothesis, future evidence 

may disprove it. In PopperÕs opinion, falsiÞ
 ca-
tion separates scientiÞ
 c from unscientiÞ
 c acti-
vities such as religion and pseudo-science (e.g., 

psychoanalysis).
It follows from PopperÕs analysis that 
scientists should focus on falsiÞ
 cation. However, 
much of the evidence suggests they seek con-

Þ
 rmatory rather than disconÞ
 rmatory evidence 
when testing their hypotheses! It has also been 

claimed that the same excessive focus on con-

Þ

on hypothesis testing, to which we now turn.

which was: ÒThree numbers in ascending order 

of magnitude.Ó The rule sounds simple, but it 

took most participants a long time to discover 

it. Only 21% of them were correct with their 

Þ
 rst attempt, and 28% never discovered the 
rule at all.
Why was performance so poor on the 
2Ð 4 Ð6 problem? According to Wason (1960), 
INDUCTIVE REASONING
Nearly all our reasoning in everyday life is 

inductive rather than deductive. Our world is 

full of uncertainties and unexpected events, 

and so most of the conclusions we draw when 

reasoning are subject to change over time. Here 

is an example of inductive reasoning based on 

an imaginary newspaper article (Sternberg and 

Ben-Zeev (2001, p. 117):
Olga, dubbed the funniest woman in the 

world, lives in a little village in Iceland. 

Olga performs in local entertainment shows, 
making her audience laugh for up to Þ
 ve 
hours straight. People are often forced to 

leave her show early
, in Þ ts of uncontrollable  
giggling, to prevent bodily harm.
If we assume the article was correct when 

written earlier today, we can put forward the 
following arguments with conÞ
 dence:
The funniest living woman in the world 
(1) 
today lives in Iceland.

Olga is the funniest woman in the world.
(2) 
Here is a conclusion we might wish to draw:
The funniest living woman in the world 
tomorrow will live in Iceland.
This conclusion represents inductive reasoning,
 
because it is only highly probable that it
 
will turn 
out to be true. Olga may die in a car 
crash today; 

she may lose her voice overni"

result, positive testing cannot lead to discovery of  
the correct rule and so negative testing is required. 

However, positive testing is often more likely 

than negative testing to lead to falsiÞ
 cation of 
incorrect hypotheses provided that the numbers 

of instances conforming to the hypothesis are 

approximately equal to those conforming to the 

actual rule. For example, if the rule is Òascending 

by twosÓ, then positive testing will often lead 

to hypothesis falsiÞ cation and rule discovery.
The importance of 
negative
 evidence on a 
version of the 2Ð  4  Ð  6 task was shown by Rossi, 

Caverni, and Girotto (2001). They used the 

reverse rule to Wason (1960), namely, Òdescend-

ing numbersÓ, and participants were presented 

initially with the number triple 2Ð 4 Ð  6 or 6 Ð  
4 Ð 
2. 
There was a dramatic difference in Þ
 rst-attempt 
solvers between the two conditions: 54% of those 

receiving 2Ð  4  Ð 6 versus only 16% among those  

receiving 6Ð  4 Ð 2. Why was there this large dif-

ference? Those presented with 2Ð"
Segment_954,4   Ð  6 experienced  much more negative evidence via producing   triples not conforming to the rule. This negative   evidence forced them to revise their hypotheses   and this promoted rule discovery. Tweney et al.

6 experienced 
much more negative evidence via producing 

triples not conforming to the rule. This negative 

evidence forced them to revise their hypotheses 

and this promoted rule discovery.
Tweney et al. (1980) discovered one of the 
most effective ways of enhancing performance 

on the 2Ð 4 Ð 6 task. 
Participants were told the 
experimenter had 
two
 rules in mind and it was  

their task to identify these 
rules. One of these 
rules generated DAX triples whereas the other 

rule generated MED triples. T
hey were also  

told that 2Ð 
4 Ð 
6 was a DAX triple. Whenever the 
participants generated a set of three numbers, 

they were informed whether the set Þ
 tted the  
DAX rule or the MED rule. The correct 
answer 
was that the DAX rule was any three numbers 

in ascending order and the MED rule covered 

all other sets of numbers.
Over 50% of the participants produced 
the correct answer on their Þ rst attempt. This 
most people show 
conÞ
 rmation bias
, i.e., they 
try to generate numbers conforming to their 

original hypothesis. For example, participants 

whose original hypothesis or rule was that the 

second number is twice the Þ rst, and the third 

number is three times the Þ rst number tended 

to generate sets of numbers consistent with 

that hypothesis (e.g., 6Ð12Ð18; 50 Ð100 Ð150). 

Wason argued that conÞ rmation bias and failure 

to try hypothesis disconÞ
 rmation prevented 
participants from replacing their initial hypo-

thesis (which was too narrow and speciÞ
 c) with 
the correct general rule.
We will shortly consider evidence relating 
to this issue of conÞ
 rmation bias. Before doing 
so, however, we need to consider the distinction 

between conÞ rmation and positivity (Wetherick, 

1962). A positive test means the numbers you 

produce are an instance of your hypothesis. How-

ever, this is only conÞ rmatory if you believe your 

hypothesis to be correct. Consider negative tests, 

in which the numbers you produce do 
not

that your set of numbers does not conform to 

the rule actually conÞ rms your hypothesis!
Evidence
The main prediction following from WasonÕs 

theoretical position is that people should perform 

better when instructed to engage in discon-

Þ
 rmatory testing. The evidence is inconsistent. 
Poletiek (1996) found that instructions to dis-

conÞ
 rm produced more negative tests. However, 
participants generally expected these negative 

tests to receive a ÒNoÓ response, and so they 

actually involved conÞ
 rmation.
Klayman and Ha (1987, p. 212) argued that 
the participants in WasonÕs studies were pro-

ducing positive tests of their hypotheses: ÒYou 

test an hypothesis by examining instances in 

which the property or event is expected to occur 

(to see if it does occur), or by examining instances 

in which it is known to have occurred (to see 

if the hypothesised conditions prevail).Ó The 

difÞ
 culty with the 2Ð 4 Ð6 task is that it possesses 
the unusual characteristic that the correct rule 

is much more 
general
 than any of the initial 

hypotheses participants are likely to form. As a  
conÞ
 rmation bias:
 a greater focus on evidence 
apparently con˚ rming one™s hypothesis than on 
discon˚ rming evidence.

strategies as biased. Another reason i s  
because 
peopleÕs behaviour is often more accurately 
described as 
conÞ
 rmatory or 
positive 
testing.
To what extent can we generalise Þ
 ndings 
from the 2 Ð  4  Ð  6 task? There are three main 

concerns on this score. First, as emphasised by 

Klayman and Ha (1987), the 2 Ð  4  Ð  6 task pena-

lises positive testing because the target rule is 

extremely general. However, the real world does  

not (Ken Mantelow, personal communication).
Second, Cherubini, Castelvecchio, and Cheru-
b"
Segment_956,"ini (2005) showed how easily the Þ  ndings on  the 2 Ð  4  Ð  6 task could be altered. They argued   that people try to preserve as much information   as possible in their initial hypothesis. As expected,   participants given two triples such as 6  Ð  8  Ð10   and 16  Ð18 Ð20 tended to produce Òincr",Explores how recognition influences cognition.,"awareness, emotion, perception",Nested under Chapter on perception,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in emotion,Aligned with contemporary studies on awareness,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_692,"ini (2005) showed how easily the Þ
 ndings on 
the 2 Ð  4  Ð  6 task could be altered. They argued 

that people try to preserve as much information 

as possible in their initial hypothesis. As expected, 

participants given two triples such as 6  Ð  8  Ð10 

and 16  Ð18 Ð20 tended to produce Òincreasing 

by twosÓ as their Þ rst hypothesis. Of more 

interest, participants given two triples such as 

6Ð 8 Ð10 and 9 Ð14 Ð15 tended to produce much 

more general hypotheses (e.g., Òincreasing num-

bersÓ). Thus, it 
is very easy to change the nature 
of the initial hypothesis offered by participants 

performing the 2Ð  4  Ð  6 task.
Second, additional factors may come into 
play in the real world. For example, pro-

fessional scient ists often focus their research 

on trying to disconÞ rm the theories of other 

scientists. In 1977, the Þ
 rst author took part in 
a conference on the levels-of-processing approach 

to learning and memory (see Chapter 6). Almost 

without exception, the research presented was 

designed to identify limitations and problems 

with that approach.
Hypothesis testing: simulated and 
real research environments
Mynatt, Doherty, and Tweney (1977) found 
evidence of conÞ rmation bias in a simulation 

world apparently closer to real scientiÞ
 c testing  
than the 2Ð 4 Ð6 task. In this computer world, 

participants Þ red particles at circles and triangles 

presented at two brightness levels (low and 

high). The world had other features, but all were 

irrelevant to the task (see Figure 14.1). Parti-

cipants were not told that the lower-brightness 

shapes had a 4.2  cm invisible boundary around  

them that deß ected particles. At the start of 
was much higher than when the 2Ð 
4 Ð 
6 problem 
was presented in its standard version. An impor-

tant reason for this high level of success was 

that participants could use positive testing and 

did not have to focus on disconÞ
 rmation of  
hypotheses. They could identify the DAX rule 

by c"
Segment_957,"onÞ rming the MED rule, and so they did   not have to try to disconÞ rm the DAX rule. Gale and Bull (2009) argued that the use  of complementary DAX and MED rules does   not ensure that the DAX rule will be discovered.

not have to try to disconÞ rm the DAX rule.
Gale and Bull (2009) argued that the use 
of complementary DAX and MED rules does 

not ensure that the DAX rule will be discovered. 

What matters is how easy it is for participants 

to identify the crucial 
dimensions
 of ascending 

versus descending numbers. They always used 

2Ð  4  Ð  6 as an exemplar of a DAX. However, 

participants were given 6Ð 4 Ð 2 or 
4 Ð  4  Ð  4 as an 
exemplar of a MED. Success in identifying the 

DAX rule was considerably greater when the 

MED exemplar consisted of descending numbers  

than when it consisted of identical numbers (74% 

versus 20%). Gale and Bull found that no partici-

pants solved the DAX rule without producing 

at least one descending triple, which further 

indicates the importance of the ascendingÐ

descending dimension.
Vall”e-Tourangeau and Payton (2008) pointed 
out that participants in studies on the 2 Ð 4 Ð6 

problem typically only make use of an internal 

representation of the problem. However, in 

the real world, people engaged in hypothesis 

testing often produce external representations 

(e.g., diagrams; graphs) to assist them. In their 

study, Vall”e-Tourangeau and Payton provided 

half of their participants with a diagrammatic 

representation of each set of numbers they 

generated. This proved very successful Ð the 

success rate on the problem was 44% com-

pared to only 21% for those participants who 

tried to solve the problem under standard 

conditions. The provision of an external rep-

resentation led participants to be less constrained 

in their selection of hypotheses.
Evaluation
The 2Ð  4  Ð  6 task has proved a valuable source 

of information about inductive reasoning. The 

original notion that most people display con-

Þ
 rmation bias is no longer accepted. One reason 
is because it can be misleading to describe peopleÕs

environment. Participants were given the difÞ
 cult 
task of providing an explanation for the ways in  
which genes are controlled by other genes using 

a computer-based molecular genetics laboratory. 

The difÞ culty of the task can be seen in the fact 

that solving this problem in real life had led to 

the award of the Nobel Prize! The participants 

were led to focus on the hypothesis that the 

gene control was by activation, whereas it was 

actually by inhibition.
Dunbar (1993) found that those parti-
cipants who simply tried to Þ
 nd data consistent  
with their activation hypothesis failed to solve 

the problem. In contrast, the 20% of parti-

cipants who solved the problem set themselves 

the goal of explaining the discrepant Þ
 ndings. 
According to the participantsÕ own reports, 

most started with the general hypothesis that 

activation was the key controlling process. 

They then applied this hypothesis in speciÞ
 c 
ways, focusing on one gene after another as the 

potential activator. It was typically only when 

all the various speciÞ c activation hypotheses 

had been disconÞ rmed that some participants 

focused on explaining the data not Þ
 tting the 
general activation hypothesis.
How closely do the above Þ
 ndings resemble 
those in real research environments? Mitroff 

(1974) studied geologists involved in the Apollo  

space programme as experts in lunar geology. 

They devoted most of their time to trying to 

conÞ
 rm rather than falsify their hypotheses. 
However, they were not opposed to the notion 

of falsifying other scientistsÕ hypotheses. Their 

focus on conÞ rmation rather than falsiÞ
 cation 
resembles that found in participants in simulated 

research environments. However, the real scien-

tists were more reluctant than the participants 

in simulated research environments to abandon 

their hypotheses. There are probably two main 

reasons"

Subsequently, participants were divided

with 61%

How defensible was the behaviour of the 
scientists studied by Fugelsang et al. (2004)? 

Note that almost half of the inconsistent Þ
 ndings 
were not replicated when a second study was 

carried out. Thus, it was reasonable for the 

scientists to avoid prematurely accepting Þ
 ndings 
that might be spurious.
Evaluation
It used to be believed that the optimal approach 

to scientiÞ c research was based on PopperÕs 

notion of falsiÞ ability. Scientists should focus 

on negative evidence that might falsify their 

hypotheses because it is impossible to conÞ
 rm 
the correctness of a hypothesis. It is now generally 

accepted that PopperÕs views were oversimpli-

Þ
 ed and that conÞ rmation is often appropriate 
(e.g., during the development of a new theory). 

PopperÕs approach is impractical because it is 

based on the assumption that research Þ
 nd-
ings can provide 
decisive
 evidence falsifying a 

hypothesis. In fact, as we have seen, Þ
 ndings 
apparently falsifying hypotheses in molecular 

biology often cannot be replicated (Fugelsang 

et al., 2004). Such variability in Þ ndings is likely 

to be greater in a statistical science such as 

psychology.
Findings in simulated research environments 
have various limitations. First, the commitment 

that motivates real researchers to defend their 

own theories and try to disprove those of other  

researchers is lacking. Second, real scientists 

typically work in teams, whereas participants 

in simulated research environments sometimes 

work on their own (e.g., Dunbar, 1993). Okada 
The issue of whether real scientists focus 
on conÞ rmation or disconformation was con-

sidered "

Alexander Graham BellÕs research on the develop-

ment of the telephone. Bell showed evidence 

of conÞ rmation bias in that he continued to 

focus on undulating current and electromagnets 

even after he and others had obtained good 

results with liquid devices. For example, a liquid 

device was used to produce the Þ
 rst intelligible 
telephone call to Bell from his assistant, Watson, 

on 12 March 1876. More generally, it appears 

that some research groups focus on conÞ
 rma-
tion whereas others attach more importance to 

disconÞ
 rmation (Tweney & Chitwood, 1995).
Fugelsang, Stein, Green, and Dunbar (2004)  
carried out an interesting study to see how real 

scientists respond to falsifying evidence. The 

scientists were working on issues in molecular 

biology relating to how genes control and pro-

mote replication in bacteria, parasites, and 

viruses. Of 417 experimental results, over half 

(223) were inconsistent with the scientistsÕ 

predictions. The scientists responded to 88% 

of these inconsistent Þ ndings by blaming prob-

lems on their method (e.g., wrong incubation

I am upset.

Conclusion

Do you accept the above conclusion as valid? 

Many people would, but it is not valid accord-

ing to propositional logic. This is because I may 
be upset for some other reason (e.g., I have 

lost my job).
W
e will now consider other concrete prob-
lems in conditional reasoning, starting with the  

following one:
Premises

If it is raining, then Nancy gets wet.

It is raining.

Conclusion

Nancy gets wet.
This conclusion is valid. It illustrates an impor-

tant rule of inference known as
 modus
 
ponens
: 
ÒIf A, then BÓ and also given ÒAÓ, we can 

validly infer B.
Another major rule of inference is 
modus 
tollens
: from the premise ÒIf A, then BÓ, and 

the premise, ÒB is falseÓ, the conclusion ÒA is 

falseÓ necessarily follows. This rule of inference 
is shown in the following example:
and Simon (1997) found using DunbarÕ
s (1993) 
genetic control task that pairs performed better 

than individuals. This was because they enter-

tained hypotheses more often, considered alter-

native ideas more frequently, and discussed 

ways of justifying ideas more of the time. Thus, 

we cannot safely generalise from studies using 

individual participants. Third, the strategies 

used in hypothesis testing probably vary as a 

function of the precision of the hypotheses 

being tested and the reliability of the Þ
 ndings 
relevant to those hypotheses. As yet, however, 

these factors have not been manipulated sys-

tematically in simulated research environments.
DEDUCTIVE REASONING
Researchers have use"

After we have discussed the relevant   research, theoretical explanations of the Þ  nd- ings will be considered.

reasoning problems. However, we will initially 

focus on conditional reasoning and syllogistic 

reasoning problems based on traditional systems  

of logic. After we have discussed the relevant 

research, theoretical explanations of the Þ
 nd-
ings will be considered. As mentioned already, 

the evidence suggests that most people do not 

reason in a logical way on deductive-reasoning 

problems, which helps to explain why their per-

f o r mance on such problems is often relatively  

poor. As we will see, other factors are also involved. 

For example, the successful solution of deductive-

reasoning problems often requires us to avoid 

making use of our knowledge of the world.
Conditional reasoning
Conditional reasoning (basically, reasoning with 

ÒifÓ) has been studied to decide whether human  

reasoning is logical. It has its origins in pro-

positional logic, in which logical operators such 

as 
or
, 
and
,

, 
if and only if
 are included 
in sentences or propositions. In this logical 

system, symbols are used to stand for sentences, 

and logical operators are applied to them to 

reach conclusions. Thus, in propositional logic 

we might use P to stand for the proposition, 

ÒIt is rainingÓ, and Q to stand for ÒNancy 

gets wetÓ, and then use the logical operator

performance under standard conditions with 

a context condition:

Therefore, ?
Byrne found that additional arguments led 
to a dramatic reduction in performance with 
modus ponens and modus tollens. Thus, we are  
greatly inß
 uenced by contextual information 
irrelevant to logical reasoning.
Premises
If it is raining, then Nancy gets wet.

Nancy does not get wet.

Conclusion

It is not raining.
People consistently perform much better with 

modus ponens than modus tollens.
Another inference in conditional reasoning 
is known as 
denial of the
 
antecedent
:
Premises

If it is raining, then Nancy gets wet.

It is not raining.

Conclusion

Therefore, Nancy does not get wet.
Many people would argue that the above 

conclusion is valid, but it is actually invalid. 
It does not have to be raining for Nancy to
 
get wet (e.g., she might have jumped into a 

swimming pool).
The above conclusion is invalid in terms of 
traditional logic. However, in natural language,  

ÒIf A, then BÓ often means ÒIf and only if A, 

then BÓ. Here is an example. If someone says 

to you, ÒIf you mow the lawn, I will give you

it to imply, ÒIf you donÕt mow the lawn, I wonÕt 

give you Þ ve dollars.Ó Nearly 100% of the

541
The Þ ndings of De Neys et al. (2005) indi-
cate that performance on conditional reasoning 
tasks depends on individual differences. Bonnefon, 

Eid, Vautier, and Jmel (2008) explored indi-

vidual differences in more detail. Their main 

focus was on conditional reasoning involving 

modus tollens, denial of the antecedent, and 

afÞ
 rmation of the consequent. They argued that 
there are two processing systems individuals 

might use to solve conditional reasoning prob-

lems. System 1 is rapid and fairly automatic, 

whereas System 2 is slower and more demanding 

(these two systems are discussed in much more 

detail later in the chapter). Bonnefon et al. 

identiÞ
 ed four major processing strategies on 
the basis of participantsÕ performance:
Pragmatic strategy (System 1)
(1) 
: This involved 
processing the problems as they would be 

processed informally during a conversa-

tion. This strategy was associated with 

numerous errors.

Semantic strategy (System 1)
(2) 
: This involved 
making use of background knowledge but 
not of the form of argument in the pro-

blem. This strategy was associated with 

moderate performance.

Inhibitory strategy (System 2)
(3) 
: This involved
 
inhibiting the impact of the pragmatic 
strategy and background knowledge on
 
According to traditional logic, peopleÕs 
background knowledge should play no role in 

conditional reasoning. However, such know-

ledge typically has a major inß
 uence. De Neys, 
Schaeken, and dÕYdewalle (2005) argued that 

conditional reasoning is strongly inß
 uenced by 
the availability of knowledge in the form of 

counterexamples appearing to invalidate a given 

conclusion. For example, consider the above 

example on afÞ rmation of the consequent. You

What did De Neys et al. (2005) Þ
 nd? The 
results are shown in Figure 14.3. First, the num-

ber of available counterexamples had a major 

impact on performance. When there were many 

counterexamples, participants were less willing 

to accept conditional inferences whe ther the 

inferences were valid (modus ponens; modus 

tollens) or invalid (denial of the antecedent; 

afÞ
 rmation of the consequent). Second, the 
reasoning performance of participants high in 

working memory capacity was better than that 

of those low in working memory capacity.

task. As Evans (2007) pointed out, this task has 
often been investigated by researchers primarily 

interested in deductive reasoning. However, it is  

more accurately described as a task that involves 

hypothesis testing using a conditional rule rather 

than a pure deductive-reasoning task.
In the standard version of the Wason task, 
there are four cards lying on a table. Each card 

has a letter on one side and a number on the 

other. The participant is told that a rule appl"

The task is to select  only    those cards that would need to be turned over   to decide whether or not the rule is correct.

to the four cards (e.g., ÒIf there is an R on one 

side of the cards, then there is a 2 on the other 

side of the cardÓ). The task is to select 
only
 

those cards that would need to be turned over 

to decide whether or not the rule is correct.
In one of the most used versions of this 
selection task, the four cards have the following  

symbols visible: R, G, 2, and 7 (see Figure 14.4), 

and the rule is the one just given. What is your 

answer to this problem? Most people select 

either the R card or the R and 2 cards. If you 

did the same, you got the answer wrong! You 

need to see whether any of the cards 
fail
 to 

obey the rule. From this perspective, the 2 card 

is irrelevant. If there is an R on the other side 

of it, then this only tells us the rule might be 

correct. If there is any other letter on the other 

side, then we have also discovered nothing 

about the validity of the rule. The correct 

answer is to select the cards with R and 7 on 

them, an answer given by only about 5Ð10% 

of university students. The 7 is necessary because 

it would deÞ nitely disprove the rule if it had 

an R on the other side.
performance. This strategy worked well 

with some types of problem but not others.

Generative strategy (System 2)
(4) 
: This involved 
combining the inhibitory strategy with 

use of abstract analytic processing. This 

strategy produced consistently good per-
formance on all types of problem.
Summary
Various Þ ndings indicate that many people 

fail to think logically on conditional reasoning 

tasks. First, modus tollens is valid but is often 

regarded as invalid. Second, afÞ rmation of the 

consequent and denial of the antecedent are 

both invalid but are sometimes seen as valid. 

Third, contextual information irrelevant to the 

validity of the conclusion nevertheless inß

One of the major developments in research 
on conditional reasoning is the realisation that 

there are "

The most celebrated (or notorious) task in the 

history of reasoning research was invented 50 

years ago by the late British psychologist, Peter 

Wason, and is known as the Wason selection

may not fully realise that they must make all 
their choices 
before
 receiving any feedback. 

Stenning and van Lambalgen found evidence 

that both of these difficulties reduced per-

formance. Only 3.7% of participants given the 

standard instructions produced the correct 

answer. In contrast, 13% of those alerted to 

the possible falsity of the rule got the answer 

right, as did 18% of those explicitly warned 

that they would not receive any feedback before 

making all their choices.
It appears that more complex cognitive pro-
cesses are required for successful performance 

on abstract versions of the Wason selection task 

than for concrete versions or deontic versions. 

Stanovich and West (1998) found that individual 

differences in cognitive ability were much more 

important in predicting correct solutions with 

the abstract selection task than either of the 

other two versions.
Social contract theory
The traditional Wason selection task involves 

an indicative rule (e.g., ÒIf there is a 
p
, then 

there is a 
q
Ó). However, it is also possible to 

use a deontic rule (e.g., ÒIf there is a p, then you  

must

explicit (e.g., the emphasis on disproving the 

rule). Unsurprisingly, performance on the Wason  

selection task is generally much better when 

deontic rules are used rather than indicative 

rules (Evans, 2007).
Cosmides (1989) proposed social contract 
theory to explain 
why
 deontic rules lead to 

superior performance. According to this theory, 

which was based on an evolutionary approach 

to cognition, people have rules maximising their 
Numerous attempts have been made to 
account for performance on the Wason selection 

task. One of the most successful was that of Evans 

(e.g., 1998), who identiÞ ed matching bias as 

an important factor. 
Matching bias
 refers to the 

tendency for participants to select cards matching 

the items named in the rule regardless of whether  

the matched items are correct. There is much 

evidence for matching bias. For example, Ball, 

Lucas, Miles, and Gale (2003) used the following 

problems, with the percentage of participants 

choosing each card in brackets:
Rule: If A, then 3
(1) 
Cards: A (87%), J (7%), 3 (60%), 7 (3%)

Rule: If E, then not 5
(2) 
Cards: E (83%), L (23%), 2 (13%), 

5 (43%)
As you can see, cards matching items in the 

rule were selected much more often than cards 

not matching items in the rule on both problems. 

What is striking about the Þ
 
ndings is that select-
ing the number Ò3Ó in problem 1 is incorrect, 

whereas selecting the number Ò5Ó in problem 2  

is correct. Thus, matching bias is often more 

important than the correctness or otherwise of 

the individual cards.
One likely reason why even highly intel-
ligent individuals perform poorly on the Wason 

selection task is because it is abstract. Wason 

and Shapiro (1971) used four cards (Manchester, 

Leeds, car, and train) and the rule, ÒEvery time 

I go to Manchester I travel by carÓ. The correct 

answer (i.e"
Segment_970,"., ÒManchesterÓ and ÒcarÓ) was given    by 62% of the participants compared to only   12% given the standard abstract version of the   task. However, other studies comparing con-  crete and abstract versions of the selection task   have produced inconsistent Þ ndings (see Evans,   2002, for a review",Explores how memory influences cognition.,"memory, attention, recognition",Nested under Chapter on attention,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in emotion,Aligned with contemporary studies on awareness,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_1380,"., ÒManchesterÓ and ÒcarÓ) was given  

by 62% of the participants compared to only 

12% given the standard abstract version of the 

task. However, other studies comparing con-

crete and abstract versions of the selection task 

have produced inconsistent Þ ndings (see Evans, 

2002, for a review).
Stenning and van Lambalgen (2004) argued 
that many people have various difÞ
 culties in 
interpreting precisely what the selection prob-

lem is all about. First, the rule is proposed by 

an authoritative experimenter, which may bias 

participants in favour of assuming that it is 

very likely to be correct. Second, participants

items explicitly mentioned in the rule.

For each order, he Þ lls out a card. On one side 
of the card, he indicates whether he has received  

the item ordered, and on the other side he 

indicates whether he has paid for the items 

ordered. He places four orders, and what is 

visible on the four cards is as follows: Òitem 

paid forÓ; Òitem not paid forÓ, Òitem receivedÓ, 

and Òitem not receivedÓ. Which cards does Paolo 

need to turn over to decide whether he has been 

cheated? Sperber and Girotto found that 68% 

of their participants made the correct choices 

(i.e., Òitem paid forÓ; Òitem not receivedÓ).
Deontic versions of WasonÕs selection task 
are much easier than standard indicative versions 

in part because the structure of the problem 

is made more explicit. For example, cheating 

means we have fulÞ lled our side of the bargain 

but failed to receive the agreed beneÞ
 t. Social 
contract theory may account for some Þ

involving cheating. However, it does not account

Sperber and Girotto (2002) argued that 
Þ
 ndings on WasonÕs selection task can be ex-
plained by their relevance theory. According 

to this theory, people simply engage in a com-

prehension process in which they evaluate the 

relevance
 of the four cards to the conditional 

rule. Worryingly for those who regard the 

Wason selection task as an important measure 

of deductive reasoning, Sperber and Girotto 

argued that people generally donÕt engage in 

reasoning at all!
Evaluation
A small percentage of individuals (mostly of 

high intelligence) obtain the correct answer on 

the standard Wason selection task, presumably 

because they use deductive reasoning. However,  

the great majority produce incorrect answers. 

This occurs because they use simple strategies 

like matching bias and/or because they do not 

understand fully what the task involves. Perfor-

mance is substantially better with deontic rules 

than with indicative ones, because the former rules 

direct peopleÕs attention to the importance of 

disproving the rule rather than

ability to achieve their goals in social situations. 

Cosmides emphasised situations involving social 

exchange, in which two people must cooperate 

for mutual beneÞ t. Of particular importance 

are social contracts based on an agreement that 

someone will only receive a beneÞ t (e.g., travel-

ling by train) provided they have incurred the 

appropriate cost (e.g., buying a ticket). Allegedly, 

people possess a Òcheat-detecting algorithmÓ 

(computational procedure) allowing them to 

identify cases of cheating (e.g., travelling by train 

without having bought a ticket).
The main prediction from social contract 
theory is that people should perform especially 

well when the Wason selection task is phrased 

so that showing the rule is false involves detecting 

cheaters. Sperber and Girotto (2002) gave some 

of their participants a version of"

AND DEDUCTIVE REASONING

effect was investigated by Klauer, Musch, and 
Naumer (2000). In their study on syllogistic 

reasoning, half the conclusions were believable 

(e.g., ÒSome Þ sh are not troutÓ), whereas the 

others were unbelievable (e.g., ÒSome trout are 

not Þ shÓ). In addition, half of the syllogisms 

were valid and the remainder invalid. However,  

some participants were told that only one-sixth 

of the syllogisms were valid, whereas others were 

told that Þ ve-sixths were valid.
What did Klauer et al. (2000) Þ
 nd? First, they 
obtained a base-rate effect: syllogistic reasoning 

performance was inß uenced by the perceived pro-

bability of syllogisms being valid (see Figure 14.5). 

Second, Klauer et al. reported strong evidence 

for belief bias: valid and invalid conclusions 

were more likely to be endorsed as valid when 

believable than when they were unbelievable 

(see Figure 14.5). Both of these Þ
 ndings indicate 
that participantsÕ decisions on the validity of 

syllogism conclusions were inß uenced by factors 

having nothing to do with logic.
We will see shortly that major theories of 
deductive reasoning have shed much light on 

the processes underlying belief bias. For now, 

we will brieß y consider some of the problems 

caused by the differences between the meanings 

of expressions in formal logic and in everyday 

life. For example, we often assume that, ÒAll As  

are BsÓ means that ÒAll Bs are AsÓ, and that, 

ÒSome As are not BsÓ means that ÒSome Bs are  

not AsÓ. Ceraso and Provitera (1971"
Segment_973,") tried to   prevent these misinterpretations by spelling out   the premises unambiguously (e.g., ÒAll As are   Bs, but some Bs are not AsÓ).

Finally, note that 

Oaksford, Chater, Grainger, and Larkin (1997) 

put forward an alternative explanation of per-

formance on the Wason selection task (discussed 

near the end of the chapter).
Syllogistic reasoning
Syllogistic reasoning has been studied for over 

2000 years. A 
syllogism
 consists of two premises 
or statements followed by a conclusion. Here 

is an example of a syllogism: ÒAll A are B. All 

B are C. Therefore, all A are CÓ). A syllogism 

contains three items (A, B, and C), with one 

of them (B) occurring in both premises. The 

premises and the conclusion each contain one 

of the following quantiÞ ers: all; some; no; and 

some . . . not. Altogether, there are 64 different 

possible sets of premises. Each premise can be 

combined with eight possible conclusions to 

give a grand total of 512 possible syllogisms, 

most of which are invalid.
When you are presented with a syllogism, 
you have to decide whether the conclusion is 

valid in the light of the premises. The validity 

(or otherwise) of the conclusion depends 

only
 on whether it follows logically from the 

premises. The truth or falsity of the conclusion 

in the real world is irrelevant. Consider the 

following example:
Premises

All children are obedient.

All girl guides are children.

Conclusion

Therefore, all girl guides are obedient.
The conclusion follows logically from the 

premises. Thus, it is valid regardless of your 

views about the obedience of children.
Evidence
People often make errors in syllogistic reason-

ing, in part because of the existence of various 

biases. For example, there is 
belief bias

a tendency to accept invalid conclusions if they 

are believable and to reject valid conclusions

meanings of various words and expressions 
in formal logic differ signiÞ cantly from their 

meanings in everyday life. We turn now to 

theoretical accounts of the processes involved 

in conditional and syllogistic reasoning.
THEORIES OF DEDUCTIVE 
REASONING
There are more theories of deductive reasoning  
than you can shake a stick at. However, the 

theoretical approach that has been most inß
 u-
ential over the past 20 years or so is probably the  

men ta l  mo d el  th eo ry  p u t forw a rd  b y Johnson-

Laird (1983, 1999). Accordingly, that is the Þ
 rst 
theory we will consider. After that, w e  
turn 
our attention to the dual-system 
approach 
that is rapidly gaining in popularity. There are 

several dual-system theories, but they are all 

based on the assumption that reasoning can 

involve two very different processing systems. 

What is of central importance to both theoretical 

approaches is to explain 
why
 nearly everyone 

makes many errors on deductive reasoning 

tasks and to provide a 
persuasive 
account of 

the processes 
underlying these 
errors.
Mental models
Johnson-Laird (1983, 1999) argues that indi-

viduals carrying out a reasoning task construct 

one or more mental models. What is a 
mental 

model
? According to Johnson-Laird (2004, 

p.170), ÒEach mental model represents a pos-

sibility, capturing what is common to the different 

ways in which the possibility could occur.Ó For 

example, a tosse"

Schmidt and Thompson (2008) pointed out 
that ÒsomeÓ means Òat least one and possibly 

allÓ in formal logic but it means Òsome but 

not allÓ in everyday usage. They found that 

performance on a syllogistic reasoning task 

improved when the meaning of ÒsomeÓ in formal 

logic was made explicit.
Summary
Most people Þnd it hard (or impossible) to 

reason logically on syllogistic reasoning prob-

lems. An important reason for error-prone 

performance on such problems is because the

547
ÒThere is either a circle on the board or 
a triangle, or both.Ó Johnson-Laird et al. 
argued that most people presented with that 

sentence would construct three mental 

models: (1) circle; (2) triangle; (3) circle 
+
 
triangle. Note that what is false is omitted. 

Strictly speaking, the Þ rst mental model 

should include the information that it is 

false that there is a triangle.
In sum, Johnson-Laird (1999, p. 130) 
argued, 

ÒReasoning is "
Segment_976,just the continuation of compre-  hension by other means.Ó Successful thinking   results from the use of appropriate  mental   models and unsuccessful  thinking occurs when   we use inappropriate mental models or fail to   construct relevant mental models.

results from the use of appropriate 
mental 

models and unsuccessful 
thinking occurs when 

we use inappropriate mental models or fail to 

construct relevant mental models.
Evidence
According to the mental model approach, 

peopleÕs ability to construct mental models is 

constrained by the limited capacity of work-

ing memory. This assumption was tested by 

Copeland and Radvansky (2004). Participants 

indicated what conclusions followed validly 

from sets of premises, and the demands on 

working memory were varied by manipulating 

the number of mental models consistent with 

the premises. Eighty-six per cent of participants 

drew the valid conclusion when the premises 

only allowed the generation of one mental 

model. This Þ
 gure dropped to 39% when two 
mental models were possible and to 31% with 

three mental models.
Copeland and Radvansky (2004) tested the  
hypothesis that reasoning performance depends 

on the limitations of working memory in a 

second way. They assessed participantsÕ working 

memory capacity, and predicted that those with 

high working memory capacity would perform 

better than those with low working memory 

capacity. As predicted, there was a moderate 
Premises

The lamp is on the right of the pad.

The book is on the left of the pad.

The clock is in front of the book.

The vase is in front of the lamp.

Conclusion

The clock is to the left of the vase.
According to Johnson-Laird (1983), people use 

the information contained in the premises to 

construct a mental model like this:
book pad lamp

clock
vase
The conclusion that the clock is on the left of the
 
vase clearly follows from the mental model. The
 
fact that we cannot construct a mental model 

inconsistent with the conclusion indicates that 

it is valid.
Johnson-Laird has developed and extended 
his mental model theory over the years. Here 

are some of its main assumptions:
A m"
Segment_977,"ental model describing the given situation ¥ is constructed, and the conclusions following  from the model are generated.  An attempt is made to construct alternative ¥ models that will falsify the conclusion. In  other words, there is a search for counter - examples to the conclusion.

is constructed, and the conclusions following

from the model are generated.

An attempt is made to construct alternative
¥
models that will falsify the conclusion. In

other words, there is a search for counter
-
examples to the conclusion.

If a counterexample model is not found,
¥
the conclusion is assumed to be valid.

The construction of mental models involves
¥
the limited processing resources of working

memory (see Chapter 6).

Deductive reasoning problems requiring
¥
the construction of several mental models

are harder to solve than problems requiring

the construction of only one mental model

because of the increasing demands on work-

ing memory.
The

principle of truth
: ÒIndividuals minimise
the load on working memory by tending
to construct mental models that represent

explicitly only what is true, and not what

is false.Ó For example, consider the following

sentence taken from Johnson-Laird, Legrenzi,

and Girotto (2004):
principle of truth:
 the notion that we represent  
assertions by constructing 
mental
 
models
 
concerning what is true but not what is false.

the correct answer is ÒYesÓ rather than ÒNoÓ. 
However, they should respond faster to

questions when the answer is ÒNoÓ rather than 

ÒYesÓ. That is precisely what Bell and Johnson-

Laird (1998) found (see Figure 14.6).
Legrenzi, Girotto, and Johnson-Laird (2003) 
tested the principle of truth. Participants decided 

whether descriptions of everyday objects (e.g., 

a chair) were consistent or inconsistent. Some 

of the descriptions were constructed so that 

participants would be lured into error (illusory 

inferences) if they adhered to the principle of 

truth. These illusory inferences were either that

Here is an example of an inference that was 

typically interpreted as consistent (valid) when 

it is actually inconsistent (invalid):
Only one of the following assertions is 
true: The tray is heavy or elegant, or 

both. The tray is elegant and portable.
The following assertion is deÞ
 nitely true: 
The tray is elegant and portable.
(If the Þ
 nal assertion were true, that would 
make 
both
 of the initial assertions true as well. 
However, the problem states that only 
one
 is 

true.)
There was convincing evidence for the 
predicted illusory inferences (see Figure 14.7) 

when the principle of truth did not permit the 

correct inferences to be drawn. In contrast, 

performance was very high on control prob-

lems where adherence to the principle of truth 

was sufÞ
 cient.
Theoretically, individuals make illusory 
inferences because they fail to think about what 

is false. They should be less susceptible to such 

inferences if explicitly instructed to falsify the 

premises of reasoning problems. Newsome and 

Johnson-Laird (2006) found that participants 

made signiÞ cantly fewer illusory inferences when 

given such explicit instructions.
According to Johnson-LairdÕs theory, people 
search for counterexamples after having con-

structed their initial mental model and generated 

a conclusion. As a result, they will often consider 
correlation (
+ 
0.42) between working memory 
capacity and syllogistic reasoning.
It is demanding to construct a mental 
model. As a result, it is predicted from mental 

model theory that reasoning problems requiring 

the construction of several mental models 

would take longer than those requiring only 

one. Copeland and Radvansky (2004) found 

that the mean response time with one-model 

syllogisms was 25 seconds. This increased to 

29 seconds with two-model syllogisms and to 

33 seconds with three-model ones.

unbelievable. Eye-movement recordings indi-
cated that participants spent longer inspecting 

the premises of syllogisms when the conclusion  

was believable than when it was unbelievable. 

This is exactly the opposite of the prediction 

from mental model theory. Inspection times 

were especially long when the conclusion was 

invalid but believable because there is consider-

able conß ict in this condition.
Mental model theory focuses on the

Other participants proceeded in the opposite

then tried to show it was wrong.
Evaluation
Mental model theory accounts for reasoning 

performance across a wide range of problems, 

and most of its predictions have been conÞ
 rmed  
experimentally. There is convincing evidence 

that many errors on deductive reasoning tasks 

occur because people use the principle of truth 

and ignore what is false (e.g., Legrenzi et al., 

2003). Furthermore, the notion that reasoning 

involves similar processes to normal compre-

hension is a powerful one. An important impli-

cation is that the artiÞ cial problems used in 

most 
reasoning studies may be more relevant 
t o  everyday life than is generally supposed. 

Finally, there is good evidence (some discussed 

shortly) that our reasoning ability is limited by 

the constraints of working memory.
There are various limitations with the theory. 
First, it seems to assume that people engage in 

deductive reasoning to a greater extent than is 

actually the case. It may be more accurate to 

argue that most people Þ nd deductive reasoning 

very difÞ cult and so generally engage in less 
several conclusions and may construct several 

mental models. Newstead, Handley, and Buck 

(1999) compared performance on syllogisms 

permitting either one or multiple mental models. 

Theoretically, more conclusions should have 

been considered with the multiple-model than 

with the single-model syllogisms. In fact, there 

was no difference Ð 1.12 and 1.05 conclusions 

were considered on average with multiple- and 

single-model syllogisms, respectively. In a further 

experiment, Newstead et al. asked participants 

to draw diagrams of the mental models they 

were forming while working on syllogisms. 

The participants consi"

Earlier we discussed belief bias in syllo-

believable conclusions are valid and unbelievable

believable conclusions motivate them to engage 

in a deeper and more time-consuming analysis. 

These assumptions were tested by Ball, Phillips, 

Wade, and Quayle (2006). Participants were pre-

early stage of evolution, involves parallel pro-
cessing, and is independent of general intelligence. 

The other system (sometimes called System 2) 

involves conscious processes, emerged recently 

in evolutionary history, involves rule-based, 

serial processing, has limited capacity, and is 

linked to general intelligence.
One of the most developed dual-system 
theories was put forward by Evans (2006; see 

Figure 14.8). In his heuristicÐanalytic theory of 

reasoning, heuristic processes are located within 

System 1 and analytic processes are located 

within System 2. When someone is presented 

with a reasoning problem, heuristic processes 

make use of task features, the current goal, and 

background knowledge to construct a single 

hypothetical possibility or "
Segment_982,"mental model. Heuristic   processes as deÞ ned by Evans (2006) need to   be distinguished from heuristics or rules of   thumb a s  d e Þ  ned by Kahneman and Tversky  (see  Chapter 13).  After that, time-consuming and effortful  analytic processes may or may not intervene to    revise or replace thi",Explores how attention influences cognition.,"recognition, perception, memory",Nested under Chapter on attention,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in memory,Aligned with contemporary studies on awareness,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_1202,"mental model. Heuristic 

processes as deÞ ned by Evans (2006) need to 

be distinguished from heuristics or rules of 

thumb a s  d e Þ
 ned by Kahneman and Tversky 
(see 
Chapter 13). 
After that, time-consuming and effortful 
analytic processes may or may not intervene to  

revise or replace this mental model. Such inter-

ventions are most likely when: (1) the task instruc-

tions tell participants to use abstract or logical 

reasoning; (2) participants are highly intelligent; 

or (3) there is sufÞ cient time available for effortful 

analytic processing. Note that the analytic system  

engages in various cognitive processes to evaluate 

mental models, and should 
not
 be regarded simply 

as a system based on logic. Involvement of the 

analytic system often leads to improved reasoning 

performance, but is not guaranteed to do so. For  

example, conclusions that could be true but are 

not necessarily true are often mistakenly accepted 

by the analytic system because of its reliance on 

the satisÞ cing principle (see below).
In sum, human reasoning (and hypothetical 
thinking generally) is based on the use of three 

principles:
Singularity principle
(1) 
: only a single mental 
model is considered at any given time.

Relevance principle
(2) 
: the most relevant 
(i.e., plausible or probable) mental model 

based on prior knowledge and the current 
context is considered.
precise and less effortful forms of processing. 

This issue is discussed later in connection with 

heuristicÐanalytic theory
.
Second, the processes involved in forming 
mental models are under-speciÞ
 ed. Johnson-
Laird and Byrne (1991) argued that people use 

background knowledge when forming mental 

models. However, the theory does not spell out 

how we decide 
which
 pieces of information 

should be included in a mental model. As a 

result, ÒIt [mental model theory] offers only 

relatively coarse predictions about the dif-

Þ
 culties of different sorts of inferenceÓ (Johns"

Third, the theory tends to ignore individual 
differences. For example, Ford (1995) asked 

people solving syllogisms to say aloud what they 

were thinking while working on each problem. 

About 40% of the participants used spatial reason-

ing and a further 35% used verbal reasoning.
Fourth, it is assumed that people will try 
to produce mental models to falsify conclusions 

generated from their initial mental model. How-

ever, people (especially those with low working 

memory capacity) sometimes construct only a 

single mental model and so make no systematic 

attempts at falsiÞ cation (Copeland & Radvansky, 

2004; Newstead et al., 1999).
Fifth, there is increasing evidence that two 
very different processing systems are used when 

people try to solve reasoning problems. However, 

the distinction between rapid and relatively 

automatic processes, on the one hand, and slow 

and effortful processes, on the other, is not 

spelled out explicitly in mental model theory, 

although it is implicit (Evans, 2008).
Dual-system theories
In recent years, several researchers have put 

forward dual-system theories to account for 

human reasoning and other aspects of higher-

level cognition (see Evans, 2008, for a review). 

In spite of some important differences among 

these theories, there are several common themes. 

As Evans (2008) pointed out, it is often assumed 

that one system (sometimes termed System 1) 

involves unconscious processes, emerged at an

the reasoning problem that a reasoner is trying 
to solve. For example, as we saw earlier, an 

important heuristic used on the Wason selection 

task is matching bias. This bias leads people 

to select the cards stated in the rule regardless 

of their relevance.

processes is belief bias, which was discussed 

earlier. This bias occurs when a conclusion that 

is logically valid but not believable is rejected as  

invalid, or a conclusion that is logically invalid 

but believable is accepted as valid. It is assumed 

that the presence or absence of this effect depends 

on a conß
 ict between heuristic processes based 
on belief and analytic processes. More speci-

Þ
 cally, belief bias will be stronger when only 
heuristic processes are used than when analytic 

ones are also used. According to heuristicÐ

analytic theory, analytic processes are more likely 

to be used (and performance will be better) when 

instructions stress the importance of logical 

reasoning. As predicted, Evans (2000) found 

less evidence of belief bias when the instructions 

emphasised logical reasoning than when they 

did not.
Intelligence correlates highly with working 
memory capacity. As a result, individuals high 

in working memory capacity should make more

cially, it may seem as if this heuristicÐ
analytic theory is rather similar to Johnson-

LairdÕs 
mental model theory. However, that is 
not actually the case. It is assumed within mental 

model theory that people initially use deductive 

reasoning which may then be affected by real-

world knowledge. The sequence is basic ally the 

opposite
 in heuristicÐanalytic theory: people 

initially use their world knowledge and the imme-

diate context in their reasoning, which may then 

be affected by deductive reasoning by the analytic 

system. In other words, deductive reasoning is 

regarded as much less important in heuristicÐ

analytic theory than in mental model theory.

two conditions: participants either had to respond 
within ten seconds or they had as much time 

as they wanted (free-time condition). It was 

expected that belief bias (rejecting unbelievable 

but valid conclusions and accepting believable 

but invalid conclusions) would be greater in 

the limited-time condition. However, when there 

was no conß ict between validity and believ-

ability (i.e., valid believable conclusions and 

invalid unbelievable conclusions), it was expected  

that time pressure would have no effect on 

performance. As you can see in Figure 14.9, 

all these expectations were supported.
Ball, Lucas, Miles, and Gale (2003) recorded 
eye movements as people performed the Wason 

selection task, a study we discussed earlier. 

According to heuristicÐanalytic theory, various 

heuristics determine how participants allocate 

their attention to the four cards presented on 

the task. The most important heuristic is 

matching bias, which involves selecting cards 

that match items explicitly mentioned in the 

rule. Ball et al.Õs Þ

extensive use of analytic processes than those 

low in working memory capacity. It is also 

predicted that the use of analytic processes 

while reasoning can be reduced by requiring 

participants to perform a demanding secondary 

task at the same time as the reasoning task. Both 

predictions were tested by De Neys (2006b). 

Participants low, medium, or high in working 

memory capacity were given a reasoning task. 

The task included belief-bias problems involv-

ing a conß ict between validity and believability 

of the conclusion and which required the use 

of analytic processing for successful reasoning. 

There were also non-conß ict problems that 

could be solved simply by using heuristic pro-

cesses. The reasoning problems were presented 

on their own or at the same time as a second-

ary task low or high in its demands.
The Þ ndings of De Neys (2006b) show, as 
predicted, that high working memory capacity 

was only an advantage on conß
 ict problems 
requiring the use of analytic processes. Also as 

predicted, a demanding secondary task impaired 

performance on conß ict problems but not non-

conß ict ones.
Another prediction from heuristicÐanalytic 
theory is that the magnitude of belief bias should 

depend on the time available for thinking. Belief 

bias should be stronger when time is strictly 

limited and so it is difÞ
cult to use analytic 
processes. Evans and Curtis-Holmes (2005) used

form better than those low in working memory 
capacity or intelligence in part because they are 

more likely to use analytic processes.
There are various limitations with heuristicŒ
analytic theory and the dual-process approach 

in general. First, it is rather an oversimpli˚
 ca-
tion to draw a simple distinction between implicit 

heuristic processes and explicit analytic pro-

cesses. There is evidence that heuristic reasoning 

can be explicit and conscious and that analytic 

reasoning can be implicit and non-conscious 

(see Osman, 2004, for a review). Thus, there 

may be four kinds of process: implicit heuristic 

processing; implicit analytic processing; explicit 

heuristic processing; and explicit analytic pro-

cessing. Earlier in the chapter we discussed 

research by Bonnefon et al. (2008), which 

suggested that two System 1 strategies and two 

System 2 strategies can be used on conditional 

reasoning tasks.
Second, it is assumed that there are several 
different kinds of analytic process (Evans, 2006), 

which vary in terms of how closely they approx-

imate to logic-based deductive reasoning. However, 

it is not very clear precisely what these processes 

are or how individuals decide which analytic 

processes to use.
Third, it is assumed that heuristic and 
analytic processes interact with each other and 

often compete for control of behaviour. However,  

we do not know in detail how these different 

processes interact with each other.
BRAIN SYSTEMS IN 
THINKING AND 

REASONING
In recent years, there has been a substantial 
increase in research designed to identify the 

areas of the brain associated with the higher 

cognitive process"
Segment_988,"es. Which parts of the brain   are of most importance for problem solving,   reasoning, and other forms of thinking? We will   start by considering research on problem solving    and intelligence. After that, we will focus on   research on deductive and inductive reasoning. Oberauer (2006) considere",Explores how attention influences cognition.,"attention, awareness, memory",Nested under Chapter on awareness,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in emotion,Aligned with contemporary studies on perception,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_449,"es. Which parts of the brain 

are of most importance for problem solving, 

reasoning, and other forms of thinking? We will 

start by considering research on problem solving  

and intelligence. After that, we will focus on 

research on deductive and inductive reasoning.
Oberauer (2006) considered the adequacy 
of several theories in accounting for the data 

from studies on conditional reasoning. There was 

the usual pattern of acceptance of the four major 

inferences: modus ponens (97%), modus tollens 

(57%), acceptance of the consequent (44%), 

and denial of the antecedent (38%). The two 

theories that best predicted the ˚
 ndings were 
a version of dual-process theory and a slightly 

modi˚
 ed version of mental models theory. Dual-
process theory yielded somewhat better ˚
 ts 
to the data. It also has the advantage that its 

general theoretical framework has been applied 

to several other types of human reasoning.
Evaluation
Evans™ (2006) heuristicŒanalytic theory of rea-

soning has several successes to its credit. First, 

the overarching notion that the cognitive pro-

cesses used by individuals to solve reasoning 

problems are essentially the same as those used 

in most other cognitive tasks seems to be essen-

tially correct. For example, the use of heuristics 

is common in problem solving (see Chapter 12) 

and in judgement tasks (see Chapter 13), as 

well as in reasoning. Thus, the theory has wide 

applicability within cognitive research.
Second, most of the evidence supports the 
notion that thinking (including reasoning) is 

based on the singularity, relevance, and satis˚
 cing 
principles. Most of the errors that people make 

on reasoning problems can be explained in 

terms of their adherence to these principles at 

the expense of logic-based deductive reasoning. 

The theory has some advantages over mental 

model theory with its greater emphasis on 

deductive reasoning (Oberauer, 2006).
Third, there is convincing evidence for 
th"

 cult versions of the Tower of London task.

performance of all versions. However, the key 

Þ
 ndings were that

 dorsolateral prefrontal 
cortex was asso ciated with plan generation, 

whereas the 
left
 dorsolateral prefrontal cortex 

was associated with plan execution.
Evidence that the prefrontal cortex plays 
a major role in higher cognitive processes also 

comes from studies on intelligence. For example, 

Duncan et al. (2000) identiÞ ed the brain regions  

most active when participants performed a wide 

range of tasks (e.g., spatial; verbal; perceptuo-

motor) correlating highly with the general 

factor of intelligence (ÒgÓ). A speciÞ
 c region 
of the lateral frontal cortex in one or both 

hemispheres was highly active during the per-

formance of virtually all the tasks. In similar 

fashion, Prabhakaran, Smith, Desmond, Glover, 

and Gabrieli (1997) used fMRI while participants 

performed the RavenÕs Progressive Matrices, which 

is a measure of intelligence. Brain activation 

levels were greatest in the dorsolateral prefrontal  

cortex and associated areas.
Jung and Haier (2007) reviewed 37 neuro-
imaging studies in which intelligence and /or 

reasoning tasks had been used. On the basis 

of this evidence, they proposed their parieto-

including BAs 39 and 40. Additional regions 

associated with intelligence lie within the tem-

poral lobes (BAs 21 and 37) and the occipital 

lobes (BAs 18 and 19).
Inductive and deductive reasoning
We saw earlier that there is an important 

distinction between inductive and deductive 

reasoning. To what extent do the brain areas 

involved in these two forms of reasoning differ? 

Goel and Dolan (2004) addressed this question 

using fMRI while participants engaged in 
Problem solving and intelligence
It has often been argued that the frontal lobes 

(one in each cerebral hemisphere) play a key 

role in problem solving. The frontal lobes are 

located in the front part of the brain and form 

about one-third of the cerebral cortex in humans. 

The posterior border of the frontal lobe with 

the parietal lobe is marked by the central sulcus 

( groove or furrow), and the frontal and temporal 

lobes are separated by the lateral Þ
 ssure.
There is considerable evidence that the 
prefrontal cortex, which lies within the frontal 

lobes, is of special signiÞ cance for various 

cognitive activities, including problem solving 

and reasoning. In humans, 50% of the entire 

frontal cortex consists of the prefrontal cortex. 

One fact suggesting that it may be of great 

importance for complex cognitive processing 

is that the prefrontal cortex is considerably 

larger in humans than in other mammalian 

species.
There is much evidence from brain-damaged 
patients that the frontal cortex is involved in 

problem solving. Owen et al. (1990) used a 

computerised version of the Tower of London 

problem, resembling the Tower of Hanoi prob-

lem discussed in Chapter 12. Patients with

After that, however, both groups of frontal   patients were much slower than the healthy   controls, and required more moves to solve the   problem. Goel and Grafman (1995)",Explores how recognition influences cognition.,"perception, attention, memory",Nested under Chapter on attention,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in attention,Aligned with contemporary studies on memory,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_701,"obe, patients with 

damage to the right frontal lobe, and healthy 

controls did not differ in time to plan the Þ
 rst 
move. After that, however, both groups of frontal 

patients were much slower than the healthy 

controls, and required more moves to solve the 

problem. Goel and Grafman (1995) used a 

Þ
 ve-disc version of the Tower of Hanoi. Patients 
with prefrontal damage performed worse than 

healthy controls, even though both groups used 

the same strategy. These patients had special 

problems with complex forward planning Ð they 

did very poorly on a difÞ cult move that required 

moving away from the goal.
Dagher et al. (1999) used functional neuro-
imaging with the Tower of Hanoi task. Its more 

complex versions were associated with 
increased 

activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal 
cortex. 

Newman, Carpenter, Varma, and Just (2003) 

found evidence that certain brain areas may 

be associated with

 c
 cognitive processes.

14 INDUCTIVE 
AND DEDUCTIVE REASONING 
555
We have seen that neuroimaging research 
implicates the prefrontal cortex as of central 
importance in deductive reasoning. The same 

conclusion follows from research on brain-

damaged patients. For example, Waltz et al. 

(1999) argued that the prefrontal region is heavily 

involved in relational integration, by which they 

meant activities involving the manipulation and 

combination of the relations between objects 

and events. For example, consider a form of 

deductive reasoning known as transitive infer-

ence. Here is a transitive inference problem: Tom 

taller than William; William taller than Richard;  

William taller than Richard. The following 

transitive inference problem involves more 

complex relational integration: Bert taller than 

Matthew; Fred taller than Bert.
Waltz et al. (1999) tested groups of patients 
of similar IQs with prefrontal "
Segment_992,"damage and   patients with anterior temporal lobe damage.   The two groups performed comparably on the   simple version of the transitive inference task   discussed above. However, the prefrontal patients   were at a massive disadvantage on the more   complex version (see Figure 14.10a). Waltz et al",Explores how emotion influences cognition.,"emotion, memory, attention",Nested under Chapter on memory,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in perception,Aligned with contemporary studies on perception,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_630,"damage and 

patients with anterior temporal lobe damage. 

The two groups performed comparably on the 

simple version of the transitive inference task 

discussed above. However, the prefrontal patients 

were at a massive disadvantage on the more 

complex version (see Figure 14.10a).
Waltz et al. (1999) also tested the same 
groups of patients on a test of inductive reasoning 

involving matrix problems in which the appro-

priate stimulus to complete each pattern had 

to be selected. The extent to which relational 

integration was necessary for problem solu-

tion was manipulated. The pattern of Þ
 ndings 
was the same as with deductive reasoning (see 
deductive syllogistic reasoning and inductive 

reasoning. There were three main Þ
 ndings. 
First, inductive and deductive reasoning were 

both associated with activation in the left lateral  

prefrontal cortex and bilateral dorsal frontal, 

parietal, and occipital areas. ConÞ
 rmation of 
the involvement of left prefrontal cortex in 

deductive reasoning was reported by Goel 

(2007). He reviewed 19 neuroimaging studies 

on deductive reasoning, and found that 18 of 

them obtained activation in that brain area.
Second, there was greater activation in the 
left inferior frontal gyrus (BA44) with deductive 

than with inductive reasoning. This part of 

the brain (sometimes known as BrocaÕs area) 

is associated with language processing and the 

phonological loop of the working memory 

system. Its greater activation in deductive rea-

soning may be due to the greater involvement 

of syntactical processing and working memory 

on deductive-reasoning tasks.
Third, the left dorsolateral (BA8/9) pre-
frontal gyrus was more activated during induc-

tion than deduction. This is consistent with 

evidence from brain-damaged patients. Everyday 

reasoning primarily involves inductive reasoning, 

and patients with deÞ cits in everyday reasoning 

typically have damage to the dorsolateral pre-

frontal cortex. In"
Segment_993,"ductive reasoning tends to be   influenced more by back ground knowledge   in deductive reasoning, which  may explain the  involvement of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex   in inductive reasoning. 100 90 80  70  60  50 40 30 20 10 0 12 Percentage correct Relational complexity level (a) 012 (b) 100 90",Explores how perception influences cognition.,"recognition, attention, emotion",Nested under Chapter on memory,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in attention,Aligned with contemporary studies on emotion,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_228,"ductive reasoning tends to be

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
of Kroger et al. (2002). They focused on the 
anterior prefrontal cortex (BA10), which is 

right at the front of the brain, and which forms 

part of the brain areas identiÞ
 ed by Kroger 
et al. as being involved in processing relational 

complexity. According to Ramnani and Owen 

(2004, p. 190), ÒThe aPFC [anterior prefrontal 

cortex] is engaged when . . . the integration of 

the results of two or more separate cognitive 

operations is required.Ó Such integration resem-

bles (but is broader than) relational integration. 

It seems that the anterior prefrontal cortex is 

the only part of the brain interconnected exclu-

sively with other parts of the prefrontal cortex 

and so removed from processes concerned with 

perception or action. That strengthens the argu-

ment that that area integrates the outcomes of 

previous cognitive processes.
Evidence supporting the involvement of 
anterior prefrontal cortex (BA10) in deductive 

reasoning was reported by Monti, Osherson, 

Martinez, and Parsons (2007). They identiÞ
 ed 
various brain regions associated with deductive "

most important brain regions were the left 

anterior prefrontal cortex (BA10) and bilateral 

medial prefrontal cortex (BA8).
Goel and Dolan (2003) obtained additional 
evidence for the existence of two systems in 

reasoning. Participants received syllogisms, and 

decided whether the conclusions followed 

validly from the premises. Of most importance 

is what happened when the conclusion was 

valid but unbelievable or invalid but believable. 

When participants made the logically correct 

decision, there was activation of the right inferior 

prefrontal cortex (see Figure 14.12a). This pre-

sumably reß ected the involvement of analytic, 

System 2 processes. According to Goel and Dolan 

(p. 19), ÒWe conjecture that right prefrontal cortex 

involvement in correct response trials is detecting 

and/or resolving the conß ict between belief and 

logic.Ó When participants made the incorrect 

decision (and so showed belief bias), there was 

activation of the ventral medial prefrontal cortex 

(see Figure 14.12b). Such activation presumably

Figure 14.10b): the two groups performed com-

parably when little relational integration was 

required. However, the prefrontal patients were 

dramatically worse than the anterior temporal 

patients when the task required substantial rela-

tional integration. Thus, the prefrontal cortex 

seems crucial for relational integration on 

reasoning problems.
Kroger, Sabb, Fales, Bookheimer, Cohen, 
and Holyoak (2002) put forward a similar (but 

more speciÞ

tasks 
of high relational complexity are associated 
with 
activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal 
cortex.

Overall evaluation
There is strong evidence from brain-damaged 

patients and from functional neuromaging in 

healthy individuals that prefrontal cortex is 

of major importance in problem solving, intel-

ligence, deductive reasoning, and inductive 

r e a soning. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex 

is the 
region of the prefrontal cortex most often  
activated across these types of tasks, but activation 

of other areas varies considerably depending 

on the speciÞ c task. Research by Fangmeier 

et al. (2006) is especially informative, because 

they identiÞ ed the brain areas that were activated 

at each of three different stages of deductive 

reasoning. More generally, researchers are achiev-

ing 
increasing success in associating speciÞ
 c 
brain areas with speciÞ
 c cognitive processes 
(e.g., relational integration).

The neuroimaging data reported in most 
studies indicate those brain areas that were

However, such data fail to indicate the precise 

stage of processing during which each brain 

area was activated. This omission was dealt 

with by Fangmeier, Knauff, Ruff, and Sloutsky 

(2006) in a study on deductive reasoning using 

material with spatial content. They used mental 

model theory as the basis for assuming the 

existence of three stages of processing, and 

found different brain areas associated with 

each stage:
Premise processing

: At this stage, there was 
substantial temporo-occipital activation

In related research, Knauff et al. (2003) 

found that there was increased activity in 

occipital areas when more visual features 

were described in reasoning problems.

Premise integration

: At this stage, there 
was much activation in the anterior pre-

frontal cortex (e.g., BA10). This brain area
 
is associated with executive processing and 
is the same area as the one found by W

et al. (1999) and by Kroger et al. (2002) to  

play a major role in deductive reasoning.

use of informal reasoning processes (e.g., 
their prior knowledge and beliefs). This has 
led to the development of theories of deductive 

reasoning (e.g., EvansÕ heuristicÐanalytic theory) 

that emphasise peopleÕs use of informal pro-

cesses such as heuristics. Such considerations 

strongly suggest the value of studying such 

processes 
directly
 by using informal-reasoning 
tasks rather than continuing to study them 

indirectly
 via the errors made on formal tasks 

(Evans & Thompson, 2004).
How similar are the processes involved 
in formal deductive reasoning and in informal 

reasoning? Here are three differences between 

them:
Ricco (2003) found that peopleÕs ability 
(1) 
to identify fallacies in informal reasoning 

did not correlate with their deductive-

reasoning performance. However, Ricco 

(2007; discussed below) carried out more 

thorough research and obtained somewhat 
different Þ
 ndings.
Hahn and Oaksford (2007) pointed out 
(2) 
another important difference, using the 
following argument as an example: ÒGod 

exists because God exists.Ó According to 

classical logic, that argument is deductively
 
valid. In the real world, however, very few
 
people would regard it as a persuasive 

argument!

The 
(3) 
content
 of an argument is important 
in informal reasoning (and in everyday life) 

but is irrelevant in formal logic. For example, 
consider the two following arguments
 
that seem superÞ cially similar (Hahn & 

Oaksford, 2007): (a) Ghosts exist because 

no one has proved that they do not; (b) 

This drug is safe because we have no 

evidence that it is not. The implausibility 

of ghosts existing means that most people 

Þ
 nd the second argument much more 
acceptable than the Þ
 rst one.
Research on informal reasoning is still 
in its infancy. However, Hahn and Oaksford 

(2007) have carried out an impressive pro-

gramme of research in this area, and we will 
pointed out that the Þ ndings from neuroimaging 

studies "
Segment_998,"of deductive reasoning Òmight seem   chaotic and inconsistentÓ. Second, too much research has focused on  complex tasks (e.g., deductive-reasoning tasks)   that undoubtedly involve several different cog-  nitive processes.

Second, too much research has focused on 
complex tasks (e.g., deductive-reasoning tasks) 

that undoubtedly involve several different cog-

nitive processes. Finding that prefrontal cortex 

is activated during performance of such complex 

tasks sheds little light on 
why
 and 
how
 that 

happens. However, studies such as that of 

Fangmeier et al. (2006) show what is possible.
Third, more attention needs to be paid to 
individual differences in task strategies. Earlier 

in the chapter we discussed evidence that 

participants solving conditional reasoning 

problems adopt at least four different strategies 

(Bonnefon et al., 2008). The patterns of brain 

activation undoubtedly vary as a function of the 

strategy being used by any given participant. 

More coherent (and theoretically relevant) 

functional neuroimaging findings could be 

obtained if account were taken of individual 

differences in task strategy.
INFORMAL REASONING
The great majority of research on deductive 

reasoning is narrow and far removed from the 

informal reasoning of everyday life. Evans (2002, 

p.991) indicated clearly the major kinds of

artiÞ
 ciality involved in most deductive-reasoning 
tasks in the laboratory:
To pass muster, participants are required 

not only to disregard the problem 

content but also any prior beliefs they 

may have relevant to it. They must also 

translate the problem into a logical 

representation using the interpretations 

of key terms that accord with a textbook 

(not supplied) of standard logic (but not 

contemporary philosophical logic), while 

disregarding the meaning of the same 

terms in everyday discourse.
As we have seen, most people confronted 
by formal deductive-reasoning tasks make exten-

Evidence
As you have probably observed in everyday 

life, conversations involving informal reasoning 

often involve fallacies based on ß
 awed reason-
ing. Ricco (2007) identiÞ ed six of the most 

common informal fallacies (see Table 14.1), 

which you should look out for when other people 

disagree with you! He found that the ability 

to detect informal fallacies was associated with 
focus mainly on that. Their theoretical approach 

is based on various assumptions:
Most informal reasoning in everyday life 
(1) 
occurs in the context of argumentation.

Informal reasoning is 
(2) 
probabilistic
 because 
it involves evaluating informal arguments.
 
In this, it differs from formal deductive 

reasoning that involves 
certainties
.

The strength of the conclusion to an argu-
(3) 
ment depends in part on the degree of prior 

conviction or belief.

The strength of the conclusion also depends 
(4) 
in part on the nature of new evidence 

relevant to it.

Informal reasoning can be unduly inß uenced by neuroscience content
How do we decide whether the explanations 

of ˚ ndings given by cognitive psychologists or 

cognitive neuroscientists are convincing? Perhaps 

you are most likely to be convinced when there 

is evidence from functional neuroimaging showing 

the parts of the brain that seem to be most 

involved.Weisberg et al. (2008) addressed this 

issue in a study on students taking an introductory  

course in cognitive neuroscience.The students 

were provided with a mixture of good and bad  

explanations for various psychological phe-

nomena.These explanations were or were not

The students had to indicate how satisfying they 

found each explanation.
The ˚ ndings are shown in Figure 14.13.The 
students were more impressed by explanations 

accompanied by neuroscience evidence, and 

this was especially the case with respect to bad 

explanations.This is a clear example of content 

having a disproportionate impact on reasoning. 

Why were the students so impressed by neuro-

science evidence that was actually irrelevant 

to the quality of the explanation? An important 

part of the answer is that neuroscienti˚
 c ˚ ndings  
often seem more ﬁscienti˚ cﬂ than purely psycho-
logical 
ones. In the words of Henson (2005, p. 228), 
ﬁPictures of blobs on brains seduce one into 

thinking that we can now directly observe psycho-

logical processes.ﬂThe take-home message is 

that you need to evaluate neuroscienti˚
 c evidence  
as carefully as psychological evidence.

In other words, people are sensitive to those 

factors predicted by the Bayesian approach to

According to a Bayesian approach, the p e r-
ceived strength of the conclusion of an argument 

depends in part on the probability of alternative 

interpretations. For example, Hahn and Oaksford 

(2007) presented the following scenario:

deductive-reasoning performance, especially the 

ability to overcome belief bias. Ricco concluded 

that some of the processes involved in deductive 

reasoning may be useful to the interpretation 

of informal arguments and thus to the identi-

Þ
 cation of fallacies in those arguments.
We turn now to Hahn and OaksfordÕs 
(2007) theoretical approach. We can see how 

it works if we consider a study by Oaksford and 

Hahn (2004). Participants were given scenarios 

such as the following one:
Barbara: Are you taking digesterole 
for it?
Adam: Yes, why?

Barbara: Well, because I strongly 
believe that it does have side 

effects.
Adam: It does have side effects.

Barbara: How do you know?

Adam: Because I know of an 
experiment in which they 

found side effects.
This scenario presents strong prior belief (i.e., 

strongly believe), a positive belief (i.e., it does 

have side effects), and weak evidence (i.e., one 

experiment). There were several variations of 

this scenario, some of which involved a weak

on Australian university students. The students 
were enrolled in a 12-week course on critical 

thinking and spent under 100 hours involved 

in the course and associated practice. There 

were two main Þ ndings. First, most students 

taking the course showed a substantial improve-

ment in informal reasoning. Second, there was 

a moderate correlation of 
+
0.31 between the 

amount of time devoted to practice and the 

extent of improvement in informal reasoning. 

What is most striking about this study is the 

magnitude of the improvement for a relatively 

modest investment of time and effort.
Evaluation
Informal reasoning is far more important in every-

day life than is deductive reasoning. Several com-

mon informal fallacies have been identiÞ
 ed,but 
most people have a limited ability to detect these 

fallacies. Several factors (e.g., probability of 

alternative interpretations; strength of the prior 

belief) that inß uence the rated strength of informal 

arguments have been identiÞ ed. In future, it will 

be important to establish more clearly the simi-

larities and differences in the processes underlying

tasks. It will also be important to identify why 

some individuals possess much better informal-

reasoning skills than others.
John: I just heard a loud noise that 
could have been thunder.
Anne: That could have been an 
airplane.
John: I think it was thunder, because 
I think itÕs a thunderstorm.
Anne: Well, it has been really muggy 
around here today.
The probability of an alternative explanation 

was varied by setting the scenario in a wood-

land campsite or a trailer home near an air-

port. Participants indicated how convinced 

Anne should be that there was a thunderstorm. 

The ratings were signiÞ cantly higher when the 

couple were in a woodland campsite than when 

they were near an airport.
Much evidence suggests that many people 
possess relatively poor informal reasoning skills. 

For example, Kuhn (1991) studied a wide range 

of people on the various sub-skills involved in 

informal reasoning. For each sub-skill, approx-

imately 50% of her participants had rather 

limited ability. For example, over half of those 

participants who had opinions on controversial 

issues could not provide any genuine evidence 

to support their opinions.
How easy is it to improve peopleÕs informal 
reasoning? This issue was addressed by van

a good deal of time to make a precise judge-
ment at any particular point in time. Under these 

circumstances, an approximate judgement based 

on a simpler, less effortful heuristic may be 

much more appropriate.Ó
Second, performance on laboratory judge-
ment and decision tasks is often poor because 

important information is lacking. On many 

judgement problems, people ignore base-rate 

information because its relevance has not been 

made explicit. When problems are re-worded 

so that people can use their intuitive causal 

knowledge to understand why base-rate infor-

mation is relevant, judgement performance is 

much better (Krynski & Tenenbaum, 2007).
Third, many of the so-called ÒerrorsÓ in 
human judgement and decision making only 

appear as such when we think of people as 

operating in a social vacuum. As Tetlock and 

Mellers (2002, p. 98) pointed out, ÒMany effects  

that look like biases from a strictly individual 

level of analysis may be sensible responses to 

interpersonal and institutional pressures for 

accountability.Ó For example, Camerer, Babcock, 

Loewenstein, and Thaler (1997) pointed out 

that New York cab drivers would maximise their 

earnings by working fewer hours when business 

was slack and longer hours when business was 

good. In fact, however, many cab drivers did 

precisely the opposite! The most plausible explan-

ation of their behaviour is that they felt under 

pressure from their families to bring home a 

reasonable amount of money every day.
Many of the apparent ÒerrorsÓ on deductive-
reasoning tasks are also less serious than they 

seem. Evans (1993, 2002) identiÞ ed three major 

problems with the conclusion that poor per-

formance on deductive-reasoning tasks means 

that people are illogical and irrational. First, 

there is the normative system problem: the 

system (e.g., propositional logic) "

ARE HUMANS RATIONAL?
Much of the research discussed in this chapter 

and the two previous ones apparently indicates 

that our thinking and reasoning are often in-

adequate. The message seems to be that most 

people are simply not rational in their thinking. 

For example, we often ignore important base-rate 

information when making judgements, approxi-

mately 90% of people produce the wrong answer 

on the Wason selection task, and we are very 

prone 
to belief bias in syllogistic reasoning.
If we take the above Þ ndings at face value, they 
reveal a paradox. Most people apparently cope 

reasonably well with the problems and challenges 

of everyday life, and yet seem irrational and 

illogical when given thinking and reasoning pro-

blems in the laboratory. However, this overstates 

the differences between everyday life and the 

laboratory. It may well be that our everyday 

thinking is less rational than we believe and that 

our thinking and reasoning in the laboratory 

are less inadequate than is often supposed. So 

far as everyday thinking is concerned, there is 

evidence that many peopleÕs informal reasoning 

abilities are rather limited (Kuhn, 1991). Here 

is a concrete example. Most British people argue 

that it is worth spending billions of pounds to 

improve the safety of the rail system. However, 

the same people habitually travel by car rather 

than by train, even though travelling by car is 

approximately 30 Ð50 times more dangerous 

than travelling by train!
What about laboratory research? There are 
several reasons why many of the apparent in-

adequacies and limitations of human thinking 

and "

First, it is often sensible for people to make

tell us little about reasoning in the real world. 
One way in which they are artiÞ cial is that 

people are not supposed to make use of any 

relevant background knowledge they possess. 

For example, the validity of conclusions does 

not depend at all on whether they are believable 

or unbelievable. It is difÞ cult to think of real-

world reasoning problems in which background  

knowledge is totally irrelevant. Another way 

in which laboratory deductive-reasoning tasks 

are artiÞ cial is that conclusions are deÞ
 nitely 
valid or deÞ nitely invalid. In contrast, reasoning 

in everyday life nearly always involves varying 

levels of probability rather than certainties. As 

Oaksford (1997, p. 260) pointed out, ÒMany 

of the errors and biases seen in peopleÕs reasoning 

are likely to be the result of importing their 

everyday probabilistic strategies into the lab.Ó

made that performance on most judgement

 peopleÕs

We will discuss four types of relevant evidence.
First, Camerer and Hogarth (1999) reviewed 
74 studies concerned with the effects of motivation 

on thinking and reasoning. They found across 

several tasks that the provision of incentives rarely 

led to improved performance. That strongly 

suggests that poor motivation is not responsible 

for the poor judgement and reasoning exhibited 

by many participants in laboratory studies.
Second, there is research focusing on indi-
vidual differences. Brase, Fiddick, and Harries 

(2006) found, with a complex judgement task 

involving use of base-rate information, that 

students from a leading university were more 

likely than those from a second-tier university 

to obtain the correct answer (40% versus 19%). 

Stanovich and West (1998, 2000, 2008) found 

that highly intelligent individuals performed 

better than less intelligent ones on various 

deductive-reasoning problems. Working memory 

capacity (which correlates highly with intelli-

gence) has been found to predict performance 
answer may actually be reasoning logically based 

on their interpretation of the problem! We can 

see the interpretation problem clearly in problems 

using the word ÒifÓ. In propositional logic, ÒIf 

A, then BÓ, is valid except in the case of A and 

not-B. As mentioned earlier, ÒIf A, then BÓ in 

everyday language often means ÒIf and only 

if A, then BÓ. If your mother says to you, ÒIf 

you clean your room, I will give you £5Ó, it 

strongly implies that you wonÕt receive £5 if 

you donÕt clean your room. Thus, the afÞ
 rma-
tion of the consequent isinvalid in pro
positional 
logic but can be valid in everyday life.
Third, there is the external validity pro-
blem. The deductive-reasoning tasks used in 

psychology experiments are artiÞ
 cial and often 
If your mother says, ﬁIf you clean your room, I 
will give you £5ﬂ, you probably conclude that 

you won™t receive £5 if you don™t do what you

Bergus (2004) found that doctors showed biased 
decisions in their medical decisions, and the 

bias increased when they knew they were going 

to be held accountable for their decisions.
Theoretical considerations
Our failure to perform well on numerous 

problems involving judgement, decision making, 

and reasoning doesn™t mean that our thinking 

is irrational. For example, Evans and Over (1997) 

distinguished between two types of rationality: 

rationality1 and rationality2. Rationality1 

depends on an implicit cognitive system operat-

ing at an unconscious level, and allows us to 

cope effectively with the demands of everyday 

life. In contrast, rationality2 is involved when 

people ﬁact with good reasons sanctioned by 

a normative theory such as formal logic or 

probability theoryﬂ (p. 2).
Research in the areas of judgement and 
reasoning has indicated that we frequently use 

heuristics or rules of thumb, which involve 

rationality1. It might be imagined that our 

judgements and reasoning would be much more 

accurate when we use effortful analytic pro-

cesses which are presumably associated with 

rationality2. In fact, as Evans (2007) pointed 

out, that is often 
not
 the case. We often use 

analytic processes in a somewhat half-hearted 

way (conforming to the satis˚
 cing principle) 
that falls well short of rationality2 and leads 

to errors in judgement and reasoning.
Many theorists (e.g., Chater & Oaksford, 
2001; Evans, 2006) go further and argue that 

most people rarely engage in logic-based, deduc-

tive reasoning. According to Chater and Oaksford 

(p. 204). ﬁEveryday rationality is founded on

on conditional reasoning (De Neys et al., 2005), 

syllogistic reasoning (Copeland & Radvansky, 

2004), and belief-bias reasoning problems (De 

Neys, 2006b). All these ˚ ndings strongly suggest  

that poor performance on many tasks is due in 

part to processing limitations. However, Stanovich 

and West (2008) found that intelligence was 

essentially unrelated to performance on several 

judgement tasks, including the Linda problem, 

framing problems, the engineerŒlawyer base-

rate problem, and the sunk-cost effect. Possible 

reasons why intelligence is more relevant on 

deductive-reasoning problems than judgement 

problems are discussed shortly.
Third, some researchers have taken steps 
to ensure that participants fully understand the 

problem. For example, Tversky and Kahneman  

(1983) studied the conjunction fallacy (see 

Chapter 13), in which many participants decided  

from a description of Linda that it was more 

likely that she was a feminist bank teller than 

that she was a bank teller. There was a strong 

(although somewhat reduced) conjunction fallacy  

when the category of bank teller was made 

explicit: ﬁLinda is a bank teller whether or not 

she is active in the feminist movement.ﬂ
In similar fashion, some researchers have 
used simpli˚ ed versions of judgement tasks in 

which the crucial information is in the form 

of frequencies. Performance is typically better 

w ith such versions than with probability versions.  

For example, Hoffrage, Lindsey, Hertwig, and 

Gigerenzer (2000) found that medical students 

performed much better on realistic diagnostic 

tasks in frequency ver"

However, even with the frequency versions, only 

approximately 60% of the students were correct.
Fourth, we would expect experts to be much 
less likely than non-experts to misinterpret pro-

blems. If it were the case that most errors in 

thinking and reasoning are attributable to mis-

interpreting problems, then experts should largely 

avoid cognitive biases in their thinking. In fact, 

that is often not the case. Redelmeier, Koehler, 

Liberman, and Tversky (1995; Chapter 13) found 

that medical experts deciding on the probabilities 

of various diagnoses were biased by irrelevant 

information. Schwartz, Chapman, Brewer, and

predictions are made on the assumption that 
people try to maximise information gain and 

those card choices achieve that goal. Oaksford 

et al. (1997) carried out an experiment in which 

the percentage of q cards was 17, 50, or 83%. 

As predicted, far more q cards were selected 

when the percentage of q cards was low than 

when it was high.
Why
 do people make errors on judgements, 
decision-making, and reasoning tasks? 

Stanovich and West (2008) provided an inter-

esting framework within which to address that 

question. They adopted a two-process approach 

in which they assumed that successful perfor-

mance typic ally requires that heuristic responses 

(such as those studied by Kahneman and 

Tversky) are inhibited and overridden by more 

precise and effortful analytic processes (see 

Figure 14.15). What is of most interest is the 

notion that there are 
three
 different reasons 

why individuals produce incorrect heuristic 

responses:
Some of the basic ideas of Chater and 
OaksfordÕs approach can be seen in OaksfordÕs

this can be a real problem in the real world: only 

a few birds are swans, and the overwhelming

sense (and is more informative) to look for 

white birds and see if they are swans.
The problem of testing the rule that all 
swans are white resembles the Wason selection 

task, which has the form, ÒIf p, then qÓ (e.g., 

ÒIf there is an R on one side of the card, then 

there is a 2 on the other sideÓ). According to 

the probabilistic approach, people should choose 

q cards (e.g., 2) when the expected probability 

of q is low, but should choose not-q cards when 

the expected probability of q is high. These

sufÞ
 cient decoupling capacity to engage

(Path 3).
Stanovich and West (2008) used the above 
theoretical framework to explain several of 

their own Þ ndings. They divided students into 

two groups on the basis of their performance 

on the Scholastic Aptitude Test, which is a 

measure of cognitive ability and intelligence. 

In general terms, they discovered that cognitive 

ability or intelligence predicted performance on 

deductive-reasoning tasks (e.g., Wason selection 

task; belief bias in syllogistic reasoning) but was 

almost unrelated to performance on judgement 

tasks (e.g., Linda problem; engineerÐlawyer 

problem; sunk-cost effect; framing problems; 

omission bias). Before we proceed, note that 

Stanovich and WestÕs Þ ndings do not mean that 

intelligence is irrelevant on judgement tasks 

Ð even the low-ability group consisted of indi-

viduals of above-average intelligence.
How can we explain the above Þ
 ndings? 
Stanovich and West (2008) argued that the fact 
that the great majority of people accept the 

correct answer when it is explained to them 

means that they possess the necessary mindware. 

With many judgement problems, no clear cues 

indicate that the heuristic response is probably 

incorrect. Thus, the main reason why people 

make mistakes on judgement problems is a 

failure to realise that the heuristic response needs 

to be overridden (i.e., they use Path 2).
In contrast, with many deductive-reasoning 
tasks (e.g., involving belief-bias), it is reasonably  

clear that the heuristic response needs to be 

overridden, but it is cognitively demanding to 

use analytic processes to Þ nd the right answer 

(e.g., Copeland & Radvansky, 2004; De Neys, 

2006b; De Neys et al., 2005). Thus, they use 

Path 3. The implic"

sonable) is that high intelligence is of most value 

when high decoupling or processing capacity 

is needed.
What light does the research of Stanovich 
and West (2008) shed on human rationality? 

First, the Þ
 nding that intelligence is almost 
unrelated to performance on judgement tasks 

suggests that poor performance on such tasks 

is due more to the non-obviousness of the cues 

pointing to the correct solution than to irra-

tionality. Second, the Þ nding that intelligence 

predicts deductive-reasoning performance sug-

gests that more intelligent individuals may 

possess more rationality in some sense than 

less intelligent ones. However, this rationality 

may have little or nothing to do with logic-based 

thinking.
 Inductive reasoning
Wason argued that performance was poor on his 2Ð 4 Ð6 task because people show con-

Þ
 rmation bias. In fact, it is more accurate to claim that people engage in conÞ
 rmatory 
or 
positive testing. It is hard to generalise the Þndings from the 2Ð 4 Ð6 task, because it is 

unusual in that the correct rule is much more general than any of the initial hypotheses 

participants are likely to form. Some research on real scientists and participants in simulated  

research environments indicates that they mostly focus on conÞ rmation rather than falsiÞ
 cation  
of their hypotheses. When Þ ndings inconsistent with their theories are obtained, scientists

often blame the method they used. However, they are much more likely to change their 
theoretical assumptions if the inconsistent Þ ndings are obtained a second time.
Deductive reasoning
¥
Conditional reasoning has its origins in propositional logic. Performance on conditional
reasoning problems is typically better for the modus ponens inference than for other

inferences (e.g., mo"
Segment_1014,"dus tollens). Conditional reasoning is inß uenced by context effects and  background knowledge.

Conditional reasoning is inß uenced by context effects and

background knowledge. Syllogistic reasoning is inß 
uenced by our world knowledge and
our everyday interpretation of certain words and phrases. Performance on the Wason

selection task is generally very poor, but is markedly better when the rule is deontic rather

than indicative. Deductive-reasoning performance is typically error-prone, which suggests

that we often fail to reason logically.
Theories of deductive reasoning
¥
According to Johnson-LairdÕs mental model theory, people often reduce the load on work-
ing memory by constructing mental models that represent explicitly only what is true.

There is good evidence for this assumption. Johnson-Laird also assumed that people search

for counter-examples after having constructed their initial mental model and generated a

conclusion. There is less of such searching than he assumed. The processes involved in

forming mental models are under-speciÞ
 ed in the theory. According to EvansÕ heuristicÐ
analytic theory, heuristic processes are used to construct a single mental model, and effortful

analytic processes may be used to revise or replace it. This theory is based on the singu-

larity, relevance, and satisÞ
 cing principles, and attaches much less importance to deductive
reasoning than does mental model theory. There is much evidence for separate heuristic

and analytic processes, although it is oversimpliÞ ed to assume a rigid division of all processes

into one category or the other. The theory provides a good account of the belief and matching

biases, and also helps to explain individual differences in reasoning performance.
Brain systems in thinking and reasoning
¥
Functional neuroimaging studies and those on brain-damaged patients indicate that
problem-solving performance and performance on intelligence tests are both associated

with activation of prefrontal cortex, especially the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The

dorsolateral "
Segment_1015,"prefrontal cortex is also activated during deductive and inductive reasoning,  and seems to be important for relational integration. The anterior prefrontal cortex may  be involved in broader integration of information. There is some evidence that heuristic  and analytic processes in deductive reaso",Explores how perception influences cognition.,"recognition, memory, emotion",Nested under Chapter on perception,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in recognition,Aligned with contemporary studies on perception,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_649,"prefrontal cortex is also activated during deductive and inductive reasoning,

and seems to be important for relational integration. The anterior prefrontal cortex may

be involved in broader integration of information. There is some evidence that heuristic

and analytic processes in deductive reasoning involve different brain areas. Fangmeier et

al. (2006) have identiÞ ed three major stages of deductive reasoning, and found that dif-

ferent brain areas are associated with each stage.
Informalreasoning
¥
Since most people use informal-reasoning processes on deductive-reasoning tasks, it makes
sense to study informal reasoning directly
. The rated strength of an informal argument
depends on the strength of the prior belief, whether that prior belief is positive or negative,

the strength of the evidence, and the probability of alternative interpretations. Most people

have limited informal reasoning ability, but it can be improved markedly through training.

deductive-reasoning tasks is due to the normative system problem, the interpretation

problem, and the external validity problem. There is evidence that our everyday compre-

hension and probabilistic strategies are simply imported into the laboratory. Stanovich

and West (2008) found that intelligence was related to performance on deductive-reasoning

tasks but not judgement tasks. They argued that poor performance on deductive-reasoning

tasks is due mainly to insufÞ
 cient processing capacity (perhaps related to some kind of
rationality). In contrast, poor performance on judgement tasks occurs because there are

limited cues indicating that heuristic responses are inadequate.

BROADENING HORIZONS
One of the most refreshing developments within 
cognitive psychology in recent years has been 

a broadening of its horizons. In this section 

of the book, we will consider two of the most 

important manifestations of that broadening. 

First, there is the issue of the ways in which 

emotional factors are related to human cogni-

tion (Chapter 15). Second, there is the issue of 

consciousness (Chapter 16). It is appropriate 

to place these topics at the end of the book 

because both of them have applicability across 

most topics within cognitive psychology. Emo-

tional factors inß uence our perception, our 

memory, our interpretation of language, and 

our decision making. So far as con"

ness is concerned, distinguishing between con-

scious and unconscious processes is important 

when studying almost any aspect of human 

cognition.
COGNITION AND 
EMOTION
The origins of the notion that our emotional 
states are determined in part by our cognitions 

go back at least as far as Aristotle over two 

thousand years ago. Aristotle (who may have 

been the cleverest person who ever lived) had 

this to say: ÒLet fear, then, be a kind of pain 

or disturbance resulting from the imagination 

of impending dangerÓ (quoted by Power & 

Dalgleish, 2008, p. 35). The key word in that 

sentence is ÒimaginationÓ Ð how much fear we 
experience depends on our expectations. 

Aristotle developed this point: ÒThose in great 

prosperity . . . would not expect to suffer; nor 

those who reckon they have already suffered 

everything terrible and are numbed as regards 

the future, such as those who are actually being 

cruciÞ
 edÓ (quoted by Power & Dalgleish, 
2008, p. 35).
Aristotle emphasised the impact of cogni-
tions on emotion. In addition, however, there 

is compelling evidence that emotional states 

influence our cognitions. As we will see in 

Chapter 15, emotional states have been found 

to inß uence many cognitive processes. However, 

it has proved hard to predict when such effects 

will or will not occur.
Finally, it should be noted that some 
research on emotion and cognition has already 

been discussed in this book. For example, 

emotional states can have a substantial effect 

on eyewitness testimony and autobiographical 

memory (Chapter 8). They have also been found 

to impair decision making in various ways 

(Chapter 13).
CONSCIOUSNESS
The topic of consciousness did not fare well 

during most of the twentieth century. As is well 

known, the behaviourists, such as John Watson, 

argued strongly that the concept of Òconscious-

nessÓ should be eliminated from psychology. 

He was also scathing about the value of

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
Cognitive psychologists in recent decades 
have carried out numerous studies showing 
the importance of unconscious processes. For 

example, subliminal perception and blindsight 

are discussed in Chapter 2, automatic processes 

are analysed in Chapter 5, implicit memory is 

dealt with in Chapter 7, and the potential 

importance of unconscious thinking in decision 

making is discussed in Chapter 13. Such research  

has helped to increase interest in studying con-

sciousness Ð if some processes are conscious 

and others are unconscious, we clearly need to 

identify the crucial differences between them.
Finally, several of the concepts used by 
cognitive psychologists are clearly of much 

relevance to consciousness. Examples include 

many theoretical ideas about attention (Chap-

ter 5), controlled processing in Shiffrin and 

SchneiderÕs (1977) theory (Chapter 5), and the 

central executive of BaddeleyÕs working memory 

system (Chapter 6).
introspection
, which involves an examination 

and description of oneÕs own internal thoughts.  

Consider, however, this quotation from Watson 

(1920): ÒThe present writer has felt that a good 

deal more can be learned about the psychology 

of thinking by making subjects think aloud 

about definite problems, than by trusting 

to the unscientiÞ
 c method of introspection.Ó 
This quotation is somewhat bizarre given that 

Òthinking aloudÓ is essentially synonymous 

with introspection! WatsonÕs view was that 

thinking aloud is acceptable because it can 

simply be regarded as verbal behaviour.
It is increasingly accepted that conscious-
ness is an extremely important topic. In that 

connection, the Þ
 rst author remembers clearly 
a conversation with Endel Tulving in the late 

1980s. Tulving said one criterion he used when

CHAPTER
15
COGNITION AND EMOTION
Third, we consider the effects of emotion on  
cognition (e.g., what are the consequences of 
feeling anxious for learning and memory?). This 

is very different from the focus on the effects of  

cognition on emotion earlier in the chapter.
Fourth, we discuss various cognitive biases 
(e.g., a tendency to interpret ambiguous situations 

in a threatening way) associated with anxiety 

and depression in healthy individuals and 

clinical patients. A key issue here is whether 

these cognitive biases play some role in the 

development of anxiety and depression or 

whether they are merely a consequence of being 

anxious or depressed.
Before discussing the above four topics, we  
need to consider an important and controversial 

issue concerning the structure of emotions. There 

are two main schools of thought (see Fox, 

2008, for an excellent review). Some theorists 

(e.g., Izard, 2007) argue that we should adopt 

a 
categorical
 approach, according to which 
there are several distinct emotions such as 

happiness, anger, fear, disgust, and sadness. 

You probably agree this approach fits your 

subjective experience. However, other theorists 

prefer a 
dimensional
 approach. Barrett and 

Russell (1998) argued for two uncorrelated 

dimensions of miseryÐpleasure and arousalÐ

sleep. In contrast, Watson and Tellegen (1985) 

favoured tw"
Segment_1020,"o uncorrelated dimensions of   positive affect and negative affect.

positive affect and negative affect. In spite of 

the apparent differences between these two 

approaches, they both refer to the same basic 

two-dimensional space (see Figure 15.1).
INTRODUCTION
Cognitive psychology is still somewhat inß
 uenced  
by the computer analogy or metaphor, as can be  

seen in the emphasis on information-processing 

models. This approach does not lend itself 

readily to an examination of the relationship 

between cognition and emotion (especially the 

effects of emotion on cognition). This is so in 

part because it is hard to think of computers 

as having emotional states.
Most cognitive psychologists ignore the 
issue of the effects of emotion on cognition by 

trying to ensure that their participants are in 

a relatively neutral emotional state. However, 

there has been a rapid increase in the number 

of cognitive psychologists working in the area 

of cognition and emotion. Examples can be 

found in research on everyday memory (Chapter  

8)and decision making (Chapter 13).
We discuss major topics on cognition and 
emotion in this chapter. First, we consider 

how our emotional experience is inß
 uenced 
not only by the current situation but also by 

our cognitive appraisal or interpretation of that 

situation. Appraisal helps to determine 
which
 

emotion we experience and its intensity.
Second, we move on to a broader dis-
cussion of issues relating to emotion regula-

tion. Emotion regulation is concerned with 

the processes (mostly deliberate) involved in 

managing our own emotions and so allowing 

us to be relatively happy and to achieve our 

goals.

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
There is much support for the dimensional 
approach. Watson and Tellegen (1985) worked 
out the extent to which the data from several 

major self-report inventories (many claiming "
Segment_1021,to assess 8 Ð12 different emotions). It emerged   that about50Ð  65% of the variance in the data   from these  inventories could be accounted for   in terms of  the two dimensions of negative affect  and positive affect. Mauss and Robinson (2009)   discussed neuroimaging evidence indicating that,Explores how memory influences cognition.,"memory, perception, attention",Nested under Chapter on emotion,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in attention,Aligned with contemporary studies on awareness,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_1133,"

to assess 8 Ð12 different emotions). It emerged 

that about50Ð 
65% of the variance in the data  
from these 
inventories could be accounted for 

in terms of 
the two dimensions of negative affect 
and positive affect. Mauss and Robinson (2009) 

discussed neuroimaging evidence indicating that 

similar patterns of activation are associated 

with different emotions. In addition, positive 

emotions are associated with relatively more 

left-hemisphere activation, whereas negative 

emotions are associated with relatively more 

right-hemisphere activation.
It is relatively easy to reconcile the categorical 
and dimensional approaches. Most emotional 

states can be accommodated within the two-

dimensional space shown in Figure 15.1. 

Emotions such as happy and excited fall in 

the top-right quadrant, contented, relaxed, 

and calm are in the bottom-right quadrant, 

depressed and bored are in the bottom-left 

quadrant, and stressed and tense are in the 

top-left quadrant. When reading the rest of 

this chapter, you will see that most researchers 

have adopted the categorical approach. Bear 
in mind that many of their Þ ndings could be 

re-interpreted in dimensional terms.
APPRAISAL THEORIES
Cognitive processes clearly play some role in 

determining 
when
 we experience emotional 
states and 
what
 particular emotional state we 

experience in any given situation. Numerous 

theorists have argued that the most important 

cognitive processes involve appraisal of the 

situation. Several appraisal theories have been 

put forward (see Power and Dalgleish, 2008, 

for a review). According to Roseman and Smith  

(2001, p. 7), ÒAppraisal theories claim that 

appraisals start the
 
emotion process, initiating 
the physiological, expressive, behavioural, 

and 
other
 
changes that comprise the resultant 
emotional state
.Ó The most inß
 uential appraisal-
based approach is that of Richard Lazarus, 

and so our main focus will be on his theory. 

However, m"
Segment_1022,"ost of the research is relevant to   appraisal theories in general. According to LazarusÕs (1966, 1982) original  theory, there are three forms of appraisal: Primary appraisal † : an environmental situ- ation is regarded as positive, stressful, or  irrelevant to well-being.  Secondary appraisal † :",Explores how attention influences cognition.,"awareness, attention, perception",Nested under Chapter on recognition,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in awareness,Aligned with contemporary studies on perception,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_987,"ost of the research is relevant to 

appraisal theories in general.
According to LazarusÕs (1966, 1982) original 
theory, there are three forms of appraisal:
Primary appraisal
†
: an environmental situ-
ation is regarded as positive, stressful, or

irrelevant to well-being.

Secondary appraisal
†
: account is taken of
the resources the individual has available

to cope with the situation.

Reappraisal
†
: the stimulus situation and
the coping strategies are monitored, with

the primary and secondary appraisals being
modiÞ
 ed if necessary
.
The descriptions of these forms of appraisal seem 

to imply that they involve deliberate conscious 

processing. However, that is not necessarily the  

case. Lazarus (1991, p. 169) referred to Òtwo 

kinds of appraisal processes Ð one that operates  

automatically without awareness or volitional 

control, and another that is conscious, deliberate, 

and volitional.Ó
There have been two major developments in 
appraisal theory since the original formulation.

COGNITION AND EMOTION
573
First, it is now assumed that each emotion is 
elicited by a speciÞ c and distinctive pattern of 

appraisal. Smith and Lazarus (1993) identiÞ
 ed 
six appraisal components, two involving 

primary appraisal and two involving secondary 

appraisal:
Primary
†
: motivational relevance (related to
personal commitments?).

Primary
†
: motivational congruence (con-
sistent with the individualÕs goals?).

Secondary
†
: accountability (who deserves the
credit"
Segment_1023,or blame?).  Secondary † : problem-focused coping potential (can the situation be resolved?).  Secondary † : emotion-focused coping potential (can the situation be handled  psychologically?).  Secondary † : future expectancy (how likely is it that the situation will change?). According to Smith and,Explores how attention influences cognition.,"attention, memory, emotion",Nested under Chapter on emotion,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in awareness,Aligned with contemporary studies on attention,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_445," or blame?).

Secondary
†
: problem-focused coping potential
(can the situation be resolved?).

Secondary
†
: emotion-focused coping
potential (can the situation be handled

psychologically?).

Secondary
†
: future expectancy (how likely
is it that the situation will change?).
According to Smith and Lazarus (1993),
different emotional states can be distinguished 

on the basis of 
which
 appraisal components 
are involved and 
how
 they are involved. Anger, 
guilt, anxiety
, and sadness all possess the 
primary appraisal components of motivational 
relevance and motivational incongruence 

(i.e., they only occur when goals are blocked). 

However, they differ in secondary appraisal 

components. Guilt involves self-accountability, 

anxiety involves low or uncertain emotion-

focused coping potential, and sadness involves 

low future expectancy for change.
Second, most early appraisal theories (in-
cluding that of Smith and Lazarus, 1993) fo-

cused on the structure of appraisal rather than 

the processes involved. Thus, they emphasised 

the 
contents
 of any given appraisal but largely 
ignored the underlying 
processes
 involved 

in producing appraisals. Smith and Kirby 

(2001) addressed this issue. According to their 

theory, various appraisal processes occur in 

parallel. There are three basic mech 
anisms 
(see Figure 15.2). First, there is associ ative pro-

cessing, which involves priming and activation 

of memories. It occurs rapidly and automat-

ically and lacks ß exibility. Second, there is 

reasoning, which involves deliberate thinking 

and is slower and more ß exible than associative 

processing. Third, appraisal detectors con-

tinuously monitor appraisal information 
coming 

from the associative and reasoning processes.

determined by the total information registered 
by the appraisal detectors.
Evidence
In an early study showing that emotional experi-

ence can be inß uenced by cognitive appraisal, 

participants saw various anxiety-evoking Þ
 lms 
(Speisman, Lazarus, Mordkoff, & Davison, 

1964). One showed a Stone Age ritual in which  

adolescent boys had their penises deeply cut 

(ouch!), and another showed various workshop 

accidents. Cognitive appraisal was manipulated 

by varying the accompanying soundtrack. Denial 

was produced by indicating the incision Þ
 lm 
did not show a painful operation or that those 

involved in the workshop Þ lm were actors. 

Intellectualisation was produced in the incision 

Þ
 lm by considering matters from the perspective 
of an anthropologist viewing strange native 

customs, and in the workshop Þ lm by telling 

participants to consider the situation objectively. 

Denial and intellectualisation both produced 

substantial reductions in stress assessed by psycho-

physiological measures (e.g., heart rate) compared 

to a control condition with no soundtrack.
Smith and Lazarus (1993) tested the pre-
diction that the speciÞ c appraisal components 

activated by a situation determine which emo-

tion is experienced. They presented scenarios 

to their participants and asked them to identify 

with the central character. In one scenario, the 

central character has performed poorly in an 

examination and he appraises the situation. 

Other-accountability was produced by having 

him put the blame on the unhelpful teaching 

assistants. Self-a"
Segment_1025,"ccountability was produced   by having him argue that he made many mis-  takes (e. g., doing work at the last minute).   Theappraisal manipulations generally had the   predicted effects on participantsÕ emotional   states. For example, anger was more common   when there was other-accountability rath",Explores how perception influences cognition.,"recognition, memory, awareness",Nested under Chapter on emotion,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in emotion,Aligned with contemporary studies on attention,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_1062,"ccountability was produced 

by having him argue that he made many mis-

takes (e.
g., doing work at the last minute). 

Theappraisal manipulations generally had the 

predicted effects on participantsÕ emotional 

states. For example, anger was more common 

when there was other-accountability rather than 

self-accountability. In contrast, guilt was more 

common when there was self-accountability 

rather than other-accountability.
Parkinson (2001) was unimpressed by the 
Þ
 ndings of Smith and Lazarus (1993). He pointed 
out that under 30% of the variance in emotion 

ratings was accounted for by the appraisal 

manipulations. Kuppens, van Mechelen, Smits, 

and de Boeck (2003) argued that one reason 

might be that any given emotion can be pro-

duced by various combinations of appraisals. 

They studied four appraisals (goal obstacle; 

other accountability; unfairness; and control) 

relevant to the experience of anger. Participants 

described recently experienced unpleasant 

situations in which one of the four appraisals 

was present or absent. Their ability to do this 

suggested that the determinants of anger are 

ß exible
: ÒNone of the selected components [of 

appraisal] can be considered as a truly singly 

necessary or sufÞ cient condition for angerÓ 

(Kuppens et al., 2003). Thus, for example, we 

can feel angry without the appraisal of unfairness 

or the presence of a goal obstacle.
We all know from personal experience that 
individuals differ substantially in their emo-

tional reactions to any given situation. According  

to appraisal theory, these differing emotional 

reactions are produced by individual differences 

in situational appraisal. Supporting evidence 

was reported by Kuppens and van Mechelen 

(2007). They were interested in understanding 

why individuals differ in their characteristic 

levels of anger (the personality dimension of trait 

anger). They identiÞ ed three appraisals that 

trigger anger: threat to self-esteem"
Segment_1026,"; blaming   others; and  feeling frustrated. As predicted,  individuals high in trait anger reported higher   levels of all three appraisals than those low in   trait anger when presented with scenarios whether    or not they involved situations likely to cause   anger.

feeling frustrated. As predicted, 
individuals high in trait anger reported higher 

levels of all three appraisals than those low in 

trait anger when presented with scenarios whether  

or not they involved situations likely to cause 

anger. Kuppens and van Mechelen concluded 

that anger appraisals are more easily accessible 

in those high in trait anger than other people.
According to Smith and Kirby (2001), 
appraisal can involve very rapid associative 

processes occurring below the level of conscious 

awareness. There is much supporting evidence 

(see next section). For example, Chartrand, 

van Baaren, and Bargh (2006) showed that 

automatic appraisal processes can influence 

peopleÕs emotional state. Positive (e.g., music; 

friends), negative (e.g., war; cancer) or neutral

COGNITION AND EMOTION

(e.g., building; plant) words were presented 
repeatedly below the level of conscious aware-

ness. Participants receiving the negative words 

reported a more negative mood state than those 

receiving the positive words.
Much research on appraisal theory has 
involved the use of hypothetical scenarios. 

Several concerns have been expressed con-

cerning the value of such research:
Little or no genuine emotion is typically 
(1) 
experienced with scenarios.

Situations as well as appraisals often vary 
(2) 
across emotion conditions, making it hard 

to disentangle the effects of appraisals 

from those of situations themselves.

According to appraisal theory, appraisals 
(3) 
cause emotional states rather than emo-

tional states causing appraisals. However, 

most research is correlational and so fails 

to shed light on causality.
W
e start by considering the Þ
 rst concern. 
In the artiÞ cial circumstances of responding 

to scenarios, participantsÕ reported situational 

appraisals may reß ect their generalised be"
Segment_1027,"liefs   (e.g., what they ought to think) rather than their   reactions in genuinely emotional situations.   Robinson and Clore (2001) argued that that   may not be a major problem. Participants were   either shown slides of various emotional situ-  ations (e.g., a gun a few inches away pointing   di",Explores how memory influences cognition.,"awareness, emotion, memory",Nested under Chapter on recognition,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in perception,Aligned with contemporary studies on memory,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_48,"liefs 

(e.g., what they ought to think) rather than their 

reactions in genuinely emotional situations. 

Robinson and Clore (2001) argued that that 

may not be a major problem. Participants were 

either shown slides of various emotional situ-

ations (e.g., a gun a few inches away pointing 

directly at them; two young and apparently 

naked lovers kissing passionately) or were 

given short verbal descriptions of the slides. 

The kinds of appraisals and their relationship 

to the reported emotional states were very similar 

in both conditions. Thus, Þ
 ndings from studies 
using hypothetical scenarios may generalise to 

more emotional situations.
Bennett, Lowe, and Honey (2003) tested 
the applicability of appraisal theory under 

naturalistic conditions by asking participants 

to think of the most stressful event experienced 

over the previous four weeks. The emotional 

states experienced by the participants were 

predicted reasonably well by the cognitive 

appraisals they had used. Overall, the relation-
ship between appraisals and emotional experi-

ence was comparable to that found by Smith 

and Lazarus (1993).
The second concern is that it is hard to 
tell whether emotional reactions occur 
directly
 
as a response to situations or 
indirectly
 as a 

response to appraisals. Siemer, Mauss, and 

Gross (2007) addressed this issue in a study in 

which they used only a 
single
 situation likely 

to produce different appraisals in different 

individuals. The experimenterÕs behaviour 

towards the 
participants was rude, condescend-
ing, and very critical. Afterwards, participants 

gave emotion ratings on six emotions (guilty; 

shameful; sad; angry; amused; pleased) and on 

Þ
 ve appraisals (controllability; self-importance; 
unexpectedness; other-responsibility; self-

responsibility). The key finding was that 

appraisals predicted the intensity of the various  

emotions. For example, the appraisal of personal 

control was negatively associ"

The third concern is that  correlational   evidence indicating an association between   appraisals and emotions does not show",Explores how memory influences cognition.,"emotion, memory, recognition",Nested under Chapter on awareness,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in awareness,Aligned with contemporary studies on awareness,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_96,"ated with guilt, 

shame, and sadness, but not anger, whereas the 

appraisal of other-responsibility was negatively  

associated with anger but no other negative 

emotion.
The third concern is that 
correlational
 
evidence indicating an association between 

appraisals and emotions does not show that the  

appraisals triggered the emotion. If appraisals  

do cause emotions, an obvious prediction is that 

appraisal judgements should be made 
faster
 
than emotion judgements. In fact, 
however, 

appraisal judgements are generally made 
slower
 
than emotion judgements (e.g., Siemer and 

Reisenzein, 2007).
Siemer and Reisenzein (2007) argued that 
the above Þ ndings are misleading. According 

to their proceduralisation hypothesis: ÒAlthough 

emotion inferences from situational informa-

tion are initially mediated by inferred appraisals, 

as a result of being highly practised, they have 

become automatised.Ó However, when peo-

ple must make 
explicit
 appraisal judgements, 

they use a more 
deliberate and time-consuming 
process, which is why appraisal judgements 

take longer than emotion judgements. Siemer 

and Reisenzein argued from appraisal theory 

that people must make appraisals in order to

be able to make emotion judgements. If so, 
participants should have found it easier to 

make appraisal judgements about a scenario 

after
 making emotion judgements because emo-

tion judgements involve accessing very similar 

information to that required to make appraisal 

judgements. That is precisely what Siemer and 

Reisenzein found.
Berndsen and Manstead (2007) argued that 
some cognitive appraisals produced in emotional 

situations may occur 
after
 a given emotion has 
been experienced. For example, someone might 

want to justify their emotion by thinking of 

reasons why they might feel th"

They tested their ideas in a study in which 

participants were presented with various 

scenarios and then rated their levels of personal 

responsibility and guilt. According to appraisal 

theory, appraisal in the form of a sense of 

personal responsibility should help to produce 

the emotion of guilt. In fact, however, Berndsen 

and Manstead found causality appeared to be 

the other way around Ð responsibility increased 

as a function of the level of guilt rather than 

the reverse.
More promising Þndings for appraisal 
theory were reported by Roseman and Evdokas 

(2004). Participants indicated a food or drink 

they liked or disliked very much. Appraisals 

were manipulated by telling participants how 

likely it was that they would taste that food 

or drink. Immediately afterwards, participants 

described what they were feeling. The prospect 

of tasting a favourite food or drink produced 

feelings of joy, and the prospect of not tasting 

a disliked food or drink produced feelings 

of relief. The fact that the appraisals were 

manipulated means that Roseman and Evdokas 

came closer than most previous researchers to 

showing that appraisals have a causal impact 

on emotions.
Evaluation
Appraisal is often of great importance in in-

ß
 uencing emotional experience. Appraisal pro-
cesses not only determine whether we experience 

emotion but also strongly inß uence the precise 
emotion experienced. As predicted, individual 

differences in emotional experience in a given 

situation can be partially explained by appraisals 

varying from one person to another. Smith and 

Kirby (2001), with their distinction between 

associative processes and reasoning, have clariÞ
 ed 
the processes involved in appraisal. Recent 

neuroimaging evidence of relevance to appraisal 

theory is discussed in the next section.
What are the limitations of appraisal 
theory? First, the assumption that appraisal of 

the current situation 
always
 plays a "
Segment_1030,"crucial role   in determining emotional experience is too   strong. For example, an individual in a neutral   situation may experience intense emotion if   he/she associates something in the situation   with a future threat (e.g., observing someone   reading a textbook reminds him/her of very   impo",Explores how emotion influences cognition.,"memory, emotion, awareness",Nested under Chapter on emotion,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in memory,Aligned with contemporary studies on recognition,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_98,"crucial role 

in determining emotional experience is too 

strong. For example, an individual in a neutral 

situation may experience intense emotion if 

he/she associates something in the situation 

with a future threat (e.g., observing someone 

reading a textbook reminds him/her of very 

important forthcoming examinations).
Second, while it is assumed theoretically 
that appraisal causes emotional experience, it is  

likely that the causality is often in the opposite 

direction. More generally, appraisal and emo-

tional experience often blur into each other. 

As Parkinson (2001, p. 181) pointed out, ÒIt 

seems likely that a willingness to endorse items 

describing oneÕs helplessness and feelings of 

loss [appraisal] implies a tendency to agree 

that one is also sad and sorrowful [emotional 

experience].Ó
Third, as Parkinson and Manstead (1992, 
p.146) argued, ÒAppraisal theory has taken

the paradigm [model] of emotional experience 

as an individual passive subject confronting 

a survival-threatening stimulus.Ó There is a 

danger of de-emphasising the social context in 

which most emotion is experienced Ð emotional 

experience generally emerges out of active 

social interaction.
Fourth, the distinction between automatic 
and deliberate or controlled appraisal processes 

(e.g., Smith & Kirby, 2001) is important, but 

there is still relatively little research devoted 

to clarifying 
when
 and 
how
 these processes 

operate. Researchers too often interpret their 

Þ
 ndings with reference to automatic appraisal 
processes without obtaining direct evidence 

that participants actually used them.

Fifth, as Power and Dalgleish (2008) pointed 
out, Lazarus failed to justify in detail the list 
of emotions he identiÞ ed. For example, Lazarus 

(1991) argued that anxiety and fright are 

separate emotions even tho"

claimed that envy and jealousy are separate

EMOTION REGULATION
Research on appraisal can be seen within the 

broader perspective of emotion regulation. 

Emotion regulation
 can be deÞ ned as, Òthe set 

of processes whereby people seek to redirect 

the spontaneous ß
 ow of their emotions. . . . The 
prototype of emotion regulation is a deliberate, 

effortful process that seeks to override peopleÕs 

spontaneous emotional responsesÓ (Koole, 

2009, p. 6). As Koole pointed out, there are 

numerous forms of emotion regulation. For 

example, as we have seen, we can use cognitive  

appraisal to modify our emotional experience. 

Other emotion-regulation strategies include the 

following: controlled breathing; progressive 

muscle relaxation; stress-induced eating; and 

distraction.
Gross and Thompson (2007) put forward 
a process model allowing us to categorise 

emotion-regulation strategies (see Figure 15.3). 

The crucial assumption is that emotion-regulation 

strategies can be used at various points in time. 

For example, individuals suffering from social 

anxiety can regulate their emotional state by 
emotion regulation:
 the management and 
control of emotional states by various processes 

(e.g., attentional; appraisal).

avoiding potentially stressful social situations. 
Alternatively, they can try to modify social 

situations by asking a friend to accompany 
them. 

You can also use attentional deployment as a n  

emotion-regulation strategy by, for example, 

having pleasant distracting thoughts when you 

Þ
 nd yourself in a stressful situation. We have 
already discussed at length the use of appraisal 

as a way of regulating emotion. Finally, there 

is response modulation. For example, it is com-

monly believed that it is best to express your 

angry feelings and so get them Òout of your 

systemÓ. Alas, it turns out that expressing 

anger 
increases
 rather than decreases feelings 
of anger (Bushman, 2002) because it facilitates 

the retrieval of angry thoughts.
Attentional deployment
It is often claimed that a good way of reducing 

a negative mood state is via distraction or 

attending to something else, and there is much 

evidence to support that claim (see Van Dillen 

& Koole, 2007, for a review). 
How
 does dis-

traction reduce negative affect? According to 

Van Dillen and Koole, the working memory 

system (see Chapter 6) plays a central role. 

Working memory, which is involved in the 

processing and storage of information, has 

limited capacity. If most of the capacity of 

working memory is devoted to processing dis-

tracting stimuli, then there is little capacity left 

to process negative emotional information.
Van Dillen and Koole (2007) tested the 
above working memory hypothesis. Participants 

were presented with strongly negative, weakly 

negative, or neutral photographs. After that, 

they performed an arithmetic task making high 

or low demands on working memory. Finally, 

they completed a mood scale. As predicted,

of strongly negative photographs was less nega-

tive"

Van Dillen, Heslenfeld, and Koole (2009) 
carried out a similar study but also assessed 

brain activity. The key Þ ndings related to the 
conditions in which negative photographs were 

followed by an arithmetic task making high or 

low demands on working memory. When the 

task was highly demanding, there was greater 

activity in the right dorsolateral prefrontal 

cortex, less activity in the amygdala, and less 

self-reported negative emotion than when the 

task was undemanding. These Þ
 ndings suggest 
that a demanding task activates parts of the 

working memory system (e.g., the dorsolateral 

prefrontal cortex), which leads to a dampening  

of negative emotion at the physiological (i.e., 

amygdala) and experiential (i.e., self-report) 

levels.
Rothermund, Voss, and Wentura (2008) 
identiÞ
 ed a potentially useful strategy for emo-
tion regulation. 
Attentional counter-regulation
 
involves the use of attentional processes to 

reduce positive and negative emotional states. 

More speciÞ cally, what happens is that Òatten-

tion allocated to information is opposite in 

valence (positive or negative) to the current 

affective Ðmotivational stateÓ (Rothermund et al., 

2008, p. 35). Attentional counter-regulation i s  

used when we feel the need to be cool, calm, 

and collected. The fact that most positive and 

negative events have only fairly short-term 

effects on our emotional states suggests that 

this strategy is used frequently.
Rothermund et al. (2008) obtained evidence  
for attentional counter-regulation. Participants 

were initially put into a positive or negative 

mood state. After that, they were given the 

task of naming target schematic faces in the 

presence of a positive or negative distracting 

schematic face. According to the notion of 

attentional counter-regulation, participants should  

have attended more to the positive "

mood. That is precisely what the Þ
 ndings 
suggested.
In sum, there is considerable evidence 
that attentional processes can inß
 uence our 
emotional states. In this section, we have 
focused on predominantly positive effects of 

attentional deployment on emotional states. 

However, the effects are not always beneÞ
 cial. 
Later in the chapter we discuss evidence indi-

cating that anxious individuals often have an 

attentional bias (selection attention to negative 

stimuli) that increases their experience of 

anxiety.
Cognitive reappraisal
In our earlier discussion of research on cognitive 

appraisal, we focused mostly on behavioural 

studies. In recent years, however, research in 

this area has increasingly involved the use of 

functional neuroimaging, and this has clariÞ
 ed 
the role of appraisal in emotion regulation. Much 

of this research has focused on reappraisal, 

which Òinvolves reinterpreting the meaning of 

a stimulus to change oneÕs emotional response 

to itÓ (Ochsner & Gross, 2005, p. 245). A major 

assumption is that the emotion regulation asso-

ciated with cognitive reappraisal often involves 

higher-level cognitive control pro cesses within 

the prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate 

(e.g., Ochsner & Gross, 2008).
Another major assumption is that re-
appraisal strategies vary in the speciÞ
 cprocesses 
and brain areas involved. Strategies designed 

to regulate emotional experience involve various 

cognitive processes, and the 
speciÞ c
 processes 

used vary across strategies.
Evidence

Segment_1035,"iewed published   functional neuroimaging studies of reappraisal.   They distinguished between two types of re-  appraisal strategy: Reinterpretation (1)  : this involves changing  the meaning of the context in which a   stimulus is presented (e.g., imagining a   picture has been faked). Distancing",Explores how perception influences cognition.,"memory, awareness, emotion",Nested under Chapter on emotion,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in memory,Aligned with contemporary studies on recognition,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_532,"iewed published 

functional neuroimaging studies of reappraisal. 

They distinguished between two types of re-

appraisal strategy:
Reinterpretation
(1) 
: this involves changing 
the meaning of the context in which a 

stimulus is presented (e.g., imagining a 

picture has been faked).
Distancing
(2) 
: this involves taking a detached, 
third-person perspective.
Ochsner and Gross reported four main 
Þ
 ndings. First, regardless of which strategy was
 
used, the prefrontal cortex and the anterior 

cingulate were consistently activated. These
 
areas resemble those activated when executive 

processes are needed on complex, non-emotional 

tasks (see Chapter 6), suggesting that emotion 

regulation involves executive processes. What 

does this Þ nding mean? There are two major 

possibilities. One possibility is that there is a 

direct
 relationship between successful cognitive 

reappraisal and cognitive processes within 

prefrontal cortex. In other words, the processes 

involved are primarily cognitive in nature. Another 

possibility is that cognitive processes within 

prefrontal cortex may have an 
indirect
 impact 

by reducing activity in subcortical systems 

associated with emotion. As we will see (third 

point below), the evidence strongly supports the 

indirect interpretation over the direct one.
Second, reappraisal strategies designed to 
reduce negative emotional reactions to stimuli 

produce reduced activation in the amygdala, 

which is strongly implicated in emotional re-

sponding. This Þ
 nding helps to explain how 
reappraisal (whether based on reinterpretation 

or distancing) reduces self-reported negative 

emotional experience.
Third, the reduced amygdala activation 
seems to occur as a result of earlier activation 

in prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate. 

Wager, Davidson, Hughes, Lindquist, and Ochsner 

(2008) replicated and extended this Þ
 nding in a  
study in which participants engaged in cognitive 

reappraisal (gener"

associated with high activity in ventrolateral 

prefrontal cortex combined with
 increased
 

activity in nucleus accumbens, an area associated 

with positive affect. Thus, successful reappraisal 

may involve increasing positive affect as well

as reducing negative affect. Note, however, that 
these Þ ndings are essentially correlational and 

cannot demonstrate causality.
We can compare the above Þ ndings to those 
obtained when participants engage in expressive 

suppression (i.e., suppressing emotionally 

expressive behaviour). Expressive suppression 

is associated with late-occurring prefrontal 

activation and 
increased
 amygdala activation 

over time (Ohira et al., 2006). The typical Þ
 nding 
that expressive suppression is ineffective at 

reducing negative emotional experience may 

occur because cognitive control processes are 

used too late in processing Ð closing the stable 

door after the horse has bolted.
Fourth, many behavioural studies have 
indicated that reinterpretation and distancing 

can both regulate emotion effectively. However, 

they have not indicated whether the two strategies 

involve similar mechanisms. Functional neuro-

imaging evidence suggests somewhat different 

mechanisms are involved. Reinterpretation was 

associated with activation in the dorsal pre-

frontal cortex (possibly reß ecting selective atten-

tion to 
contextual stimuli?) and areas associated 
with language and verbal working memory. In

Evaluation
Functional neuroimaging studies have increased 

our knowledge of the processes underlying the 

effectiveness of reappraisal in reducing negative 

emotions. Higher cognitive control processes 

associated with prefrontal cortex are used 

rapidly, and are followed by reduced emotional  

responses within the amygdala. Thus, cortical 

and subcortical processes are both heavily 

involved in successful reappraisal. In addition, 

the cognitive processes involved in reappraisal 

vary as a function of the reappraisal strategy 
being 
used. More generally, functional neu
roimaging 
evidence suggests that emotion regulation is 

complex and involves more different cognitive 

processes than previously believed.
We still need to know whether the cognitive 
control processes involved in emotion regulation 
are the same as those involved in performing 

complex cognitive tasks. It is also important 

to obtain stronger evidence that there are 

causal links between prefrontal activation 

and reduced amygdala activity. For example, it 

would be interesting to see whether transcranial 

magnetic stimulation (TMS; see Glossary) applied 

to prefrontal cortex prevented reappraisal 

strategies from reducing negative emotions.
MULTI-LEVEL THEORIES
As we have seen throughout the book, the 

cognitive system is complex and multi-faceted. 

For example, BaddeleyÕs working memory model 

now consists of four different components 

(see Chapter 6). Accordingly, it is probable that 

several different cognitive processes underlie 

emotional experience. As discussed earlier, 

Smith and Kirby (2001) argued that emotional 

experience is inß uenced by associative processes 

and by reasoning.
The complexity of the cognitive system is one 
important reason why theorists are increasingly 

putting forward multi-level theories when iden-

tifying the key cognitive processes underlying 

emotion. Another reason i"
Segment_1038,"s that such theories   account for the emotional conß  icts most of  us experience from time to time. For example,   individuals with spider phobia become very   frightened when they see a spider even though   they may ÒknowÓ that most spiders are harm-  less.

account for the emotional conß
 icts most of 
us experience from time to time. For example, 

individuals with spider phobia become very 

frightened when they see a spider even though 

they may ÒknowÓ that most spiders are harm-

less. The easiest way of explaining such emo-

tional conß
 icts is to assume that one cognitive 
process produces fear in response to the sight of  

a spider, whereas a second cognitive process pro-

vides conß icting knowledge that it is probably 

harmless.
LeDoux (1992, 1996) produced one of 
the most inß uential multi-level theories. He 

emphasised the role of the amygdala (the 

brainÕs Òemotional computerÓ) in working out 

the emotional signiÞ cance of stimuli. According 

to LeDoux, sensory information about emo-

tional stimuli is relayed from the thalamus 

simultaneously to the amygdala and the 

cortex. Of key importance, LeDoux (1992,

1996) identiÞ ed two different emotion circuits 
in fear:
A slow-acting thalamus-to-cortex-to-

amygdala circuit involving detailed analysis 

of sensory information.

A fast-acting thalamusÐamygdala circuit 
(2) 
based on simple stimulus features (e.g., 

intensity); this circuit bypasses the cortex.
Why
 do we have two emotion circuits for 
fear? The thalamusÐamygdala circuit allows 

us to respond rapidly in threatening situations, 

and can enhance our chances of survival. In 

contrast, the cortical circuit produces a detailed 

evaluation of the emotional signiÞ
 cance of
 
the situation. As such, it allows us to respond 

appropriately to situations.
Two points need to be made at this point. 
First, several other theorists (e.g., Lundqvist 

and –hman, 2005) have put forward theories 

resembling LeDouxÕs. Second, while LeDoux 

has focused primarily on fear, several other 

emotions also depend on somewhat separate

and mushrooms. These pictures were presented 

very rapidly so they could not be identiÞ
 ed. 
In spite of this, the spider phobics reacted 

emotionally to the spider pictures, as did the 

snake phobics to the snake pictures. More 

speciÞ
 cally, there were greater physiological 
responses (in the form of skin conductance 

responses) to the phobia-relevant pictures. In 

addition, the participants experienced more 

arousal and felt more negative when exposed 

to those pictures than to the other ones.
Which parts of the brain are activated 
during non-conscious emotional processing? 

This issue was addressed by Morris, –hman, 

and Dolan (1998). Participants were familiarised 

with two neutral faces and two angry faces, one 

of which was paired repeatedly with an aversive  

noise to produce a conditioned emotional 

response. After that, the participants were pre-

sented with a series of trials on which an angry 

face was masked by a neutral face so that they 

could only consciously see the neutral face. 

The key Þ nding was that there was greater 

activation of the right amygdala to the masked 

conditioned angry face than the other angry 

face. Morris, –hman, and Dolan (1999) extended  

these findings, obtaining evidence that the 

superior colliculus of the midbrain and the 

right pulvinar of the thalamus were involved, 

as well as the right amygdala.

have suffered damage to primary visual cortex,

can be discriminated in the absence of conscious

indicating the existence of affective blindsight 

(discussed by Tamietto & de Gelder, 2008).
Pegna, Khateb, Lazeyras, and Seghier (2005) 
pointed out that most previous studies on 

affective blindsight had involved patients with 

lack of conscious perception in only part of 

the visual Þ eld. As a result, affective blindsight 

in these patients may have depended in part 
affective blindsight:
 the ability to discriminate 
between emotional stimuli in the absence of 

conscious perception of these stimuli; found in 

patients with lesions to the primary visual 

cortex (see 
blindsight
).

on the intact parts of their visual processing 
system. Pegna et al. studied a 52-year-old man 

who was entirely cortically blind. When he was 

presented with a series of happy and angry 

faces that he could not perceive consciously, 

he correctly reported the emotion on 59% of 

trials. However, his performance was at chance 

when he reported whether complex scenes 

were positive (e.g., sports) or unpleasant (e.g., 

mutilation).
Pegna et al. (2005) also carried out a 
neuroimaging study in which the patient was 

presented with angry, happy, fearful, and 

neutral faces. There was signiÞ
 cantly greater 
activation in the right amygdala with all of the 

emotional faces than with neutral faces, with 

the greatest activation occurring in response 

to fearful faces. These Þ ndings suggest that

Jolij and Lamme (2005) set out to show 
affective blindsight in normal individuals. They 

used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS; 

see Glossary) to produce a brief disruption to 

functioning in the occipital area of the brain 

that is involved in visual perception. On each 

trial, participants were presented with four 

items, three of which were neutral faces and the 

other of which was a happy or sad face. Their 

task was to report the emotional expression of 

the discrepant face. When the stimulus array 

was presented very brieß y and followed by 
TMS, participants were reasonably good at 

detecting the emotional expression even though 

they had no conscious perceptual experience. 

Surprisingly, this affective blindsight was no 

longer found when the visual array was pre-

sented 
for slightly longer. This suggests that 
conscious perception may block access to 

unconsciously perceived information. As Jolij 

and Lamme (p. 10751) concluded, ÒWe might 

be Ôblindly led by the emotionsÕ but only when 

we have no other option available.Ó
SPAARS model
We conclude this section by considering a multi-

level model that takes account of the distinction 

between conscious and non-conscious processes 

in emotion. The theoretical approach in question 

is the Schematic, Propositional, Analogical, and 

Associative Representation Systems (SPAARS) 

model put forward by Power and Dalgleish 

(1997, 2008) (see Figure 15.4). The various 

components of the model are as follows:
Analogical level
† 
: this is involved in basic 
sensory processing of environmental stimuli.

Propositional level
† 
: this is an essentially 
emotion-free system that contains informa-

tion about the world and the self.

Schematic level
† 
: at this level, facts from the 
propositional level are combined with infor-

mation about the individualÕ

to produce an internal model of the situation. 
This leads to an emotional response if the 

current goals are thwarted. There are Þ
 ve 
basic emotions: sadness, happiness, anger, 

fear, and disgust. Sadness occurs when a 

valued role or goal is lost, happiness results 

from a successful move towards a valued 

goal, anger when some agent frustrates a 

goal, fear when there is a physical or social 

threat to the self or valued goal, and disgust 

when something repulsive to the self and 

to valued goals is encountered.

Associative level
†
: at this level, emotions
can be generated rapidly and automatically 

without the activation of relevant schematic 

models. The workings at this level typically 

occur below the level of conscious aware-

ness, although we can become aware of the 

products of associative-level processes.
One of the main implications of the SPAARS
 
model is that there are two main ways in which 

emotion can occur. First, it can occur as a result 

of thorough cognitive processing involving 

appraisal when the schematic level is involved. 

Second, it can occur automatically and without 

the involvement of conscious processing when 

the associative level is involved. Power and 

Dalgleish (2008, p. 153) spelled out in detail 

what is involved: ÒThe process of emotion 

generation can become associatively driven 

so that it appears as if a concurrent process 

of appraisal is occurring even though it is not 

and has in fact occurred at some time in the 

emotional past. In other words, the accessing 

of the schematic model level of meaning is 

Ôshort-circuitedÕ.Ó
When does our emotional experience depend 
on th"
Segment_1043,"e associative level? First, if we have had   repeated experience with a particular object or   event, this can allow us to respond emotion-  ally via use of the associative system. Second,   we are more likely to respond associatively   with extreme fear or phobia to some objects   (e.g., spiders; s",Explores how awareness influences cognition.,"awareness, recognition, emotion",Nested under Chapter on memory,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in recognition,Aligned with contemporary studies on recognition,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_291,"e associative level? First, if we have had 

repeated experience with a particular object or 

event, this can allow us to respond emotion-

ally via use of the associative system. Second, 

we are more likely to respond associatively 

with extreme fear or phobia to some objects 

(e.g., spiders; snakes) than to others that may 

bemore dangerous (e.g., cars). According to 

Seligman and Hager (1972, p. 450), ÒThe great 

majority of phobias are about objects of 
natural importance.Ó More speciÞ
 cally, we are 
most likely to develop phobias to Òobjects that 

have threatened survival, potential predators, 

unfamiliar places, and the darkÓ (p. 465). 

The term 
preparedness
 is used to describe the 

tendency for members of a species to be most 

likely to develop phobias to certain objects as 

a result of their evolutionary history.
What is the role of consciousness within 
the SPAARS model? It would be tempting (but 

oversimpliÞ
 ed) to suppose that consciousness 
is involved when the schematic level is involved 

but not when the associative level is involved. 

In fact, the individualÕs allocation of attention 

and inhibitory processes is also important. If 

someone has several models of the self as an 

individual with mostly positive qualities but a 

few more negative models of the self, the former 

models may inhibit conscious awareness of 

the latter. Alternatively, cultural factors may 

produce inhibition and lack of conscious 

awareness. For example, Power and Dalgleish 

(2008) pointed out that anger is disapproved 

of in the Malay culture, and so Malaysians 

endeavour to inhibit internal signs that they 

are starting to become angry.
Why did Power and Dalgleish (2008) claim 
that there are Þ
 ve basic emotions (sadness, 
anger, fear, disgust, and happiness) found in 

essentially all cultures? This claim was based 

on three kinds of research evidence, namely, 

studies on cognitive appraisal, studies on 

distinctive universal signals (esp"
Segment_1044,"ecially facial   expressions of emotion), and studies on distinct   physiological patterns. Slightly different sets of   basic emotions have emerged from these three   lines of research, but the Þ ve emotions identiÞ  ed  by Power and Dalgleish have emerged fairly   consistently.

there are many other emotions, but argued that

develops fearful or phobic reactions most readily 

to objects that were dangerous in its

many of them are complex and represent a 
blend of two or more basic emotions. For 

example, nostalgia can be regarded as a blend 

of happiness and sadness.
Additional support for the notion that 
there are Þ ve basic emotions was reported by 

Power (2006). He made use of a Basic Emotions 

Scale in which each of the Þ ve basic emotions 

was represented by four conceptually related 

emotions. For example, anxiety was represented 

by the terms ÒanxietyÓ, ÒtensenessÓ, ÒworryÓ, 

and ÒnervousnessÓ. Participants indicated how 

often they experienced each of the 20 emotions 

in the questionnaire. The data were best Þ
 tted 
by a model that assumed the existence of the 

Þ
 ve basic emotions as well as a higher-order 
factor (possibly an emotionality factor).
Evaluation
The basic assumption that there are two major 

routes to emotion, one of which is faster and 

more ÒautomaticÓ than the other, is consistent 

with several other theories, including those of 

Smith and Kirby (2001) and LeDoux (1992, 

1996). Two-route theories of emotion provide 

a more adequate account of emotion than is 

possible with one-route theories. Another strength 

of the SPAARS model is that there are reasonably  

strong grounds for identifying Þ ve basic emo-

tions and for claiming that other emotions ar"

Finally, there is good evidence for the existence

What are the limitations of the SPAARS 
model? The main one is that more research 

needs to be done to clarify the ways in which the  

various processes involved in emotion interact 

with each other. For example, it is likely that 

inhibitory processes and the allocation of 

attention are important. However, the precise 

factors determining the use of inhibitory pro-

cesses or the allocation of attention remain to 

be determined. As a result, there are unexplained 

complexities in terms of processing at the 

schematic level. More generally, the use of 

functional neuroimaging could shed additional 

light on the nature and sequencing of pro-

cessing operations in emotion.
MOOD AND COGNITION
Suppose you are in a depressed mood. How will 

this affect your cognitive processes? Most people 

Þ
 nd that unhappy memories spring to mind when 
they are depressed. They also tend to think more 

negatively about themselves and the world around 

them. More generally, 
any
 given mood state (nega-

tive or positive) seems to inß uence cognitive pro-

cessing so that what we think and remember 

matches (or is congruent with) that mood state.
Bower™s network theory
Bower (1981) and Gilligan and Bower (1984) 

put forward a semantic network theory to 

account for phenomena such as those mentioned 

above (see Figure 15.5). The theory as devel-

oped by Gilligan and Bower (1984) makes six 

assumptions:
Emotions are units or nodes in a semantic 
(1) 
network, with numerous connections to 

related ideas, physiological systems, events, 

and muscular and expressive patterns.

Emotional material is stored in the semantic
 
(2) 
network in the form of propositions or 

assertions.
According to Power and Dalgleish, there are only 
˚
 ve basic emotions. However, additional emotions 
represent blends of two or more basic emotions 

(e"

COGNITION

EMOTION

Thought occurs via the activation of nodes 
(3) 
within the semantic network.
Nodes can be activated by external or 
(4) 
internal stimuli.

Activation from an activated node spreads 
(5) 
to related nodes. This assumption is crucial
 
Ð it means that activation of an emotion 

node (e.g., sadness) triggers activation of 

emotion-related nodes or concepts (e.g., 

loss; despair) in the semantic network.

ÒConsciousnessÓ consists of a network 
(6) 
of nodes activated above some threshold 

value.
The above assumptions lead to several test-
able hypotheses:
Mood-state-dependent memory
† 
: memory is 
best when the mood at retrieval matches 

that at learning.

Mood congruity
† 
: emotionally-toned infor-
mation is learned and retrieved best when 

there is correspondence between its affective 
value and the learnerÕ
s (or remembererÕs) 
current mood state.

Thought congruity
† 
: an individualÕs free 
associations, interpretations, thoughts, and 

judgements are thematically congruent with  
his/her mood state.

Mood intensity
† 
: increases in intensity of 
mood cause increases in the activation of 

associated nodes in the associative network.
How do the four hypotheses relate to the 
six theoretical assumptions? So far as mood-

state-dependent memory (typically assessed by 

recall) is concerned, associations are formed 

during learning between the activated nodes 

representing the to-be-remembered items and 

the emotion node or nodes activated because 

of the individualÕs mood state. At recall, the 
current mood state activates the appropriate 

emotion node. Activation then spreads from 

that emotion node to associated nodes. If the 

mood state at learning matches that at recall, 

this increases activation of the nodes of to-

be-remembered items and prod"

hard one offering few retrieval cues (e.g., free 
recall) than when it provides strong retrieval 

cues (e.g., recognition memory).
Mood-state-dependent effects are also pre-
dicted by other theories. According to TulvingÕs 

encoding speciÞ city principle (see Chapter 6), 

the success of recall or recognition depends on 

the extent to which the information available 

during learning is stored in memory. If in-

formation about the mood state at the time 

of learning is stored in memory, then being in 

the same mood state at the time of retrieval 

increases this information matching. Theoretically, 

this should increase recall and recognition. 

Mood-state-dependent effects are also con-

sistent with 
the notion of transfer-appropriate 
processing (Morris, Bransford, & Franks, 1977). 

According to this notion, retrieval is more 

successful when the information available at 

the time of retrieval (including information 

about mood state) i"
Segment_1048,"s relevant to the informa-  tion stored in long-term memory. Mood congruity occurs when people in a  good mood learn (and remember) emotionally   positive material better than those in a bad   mood, whereas the opposite is the case for   emotionally negative material.

tion stored in long-term memory.
Mood congruity occurs when people in a 
good mood learn (and remember) emotionally 

positive material better than those in a bad 

mood, whereas the opposite is the case for 

emotionally negative material. Gilligan and 

Bower (1984) argued that mood congruity 

depends on the fact that emotionally loaded 

information is associated more strongly with 

its congruent emotion node than with any 

emotion node. For example, nodes containing 

information about sadness-provoking events 

and experiences are associatively linked to 

the emotion node for sadness (see Figure 15.4 

above). To-be-remembered material congruent 

with the current mood state links up with this 

associative network of similar information. 

This leads to extensive or elaborative encoding 

of the to-be-remembered material, and thus to 
superior long-term memory. A similar process 

is involved during retrieval. Information con-

gruent with an individualÕs mood state will be 

more activated than incongruent information, 

and so can be retrieved more easily.
Thought congruity occurs for two reasons. 
First, the current mood state activates the cor-

responding emotion node. Second, activation 

spreads from that emotion node to other, associ-

ated 
nodes containing information emotionally 
congruent with the activated emotion node.
Mood-state-dependent memory
Mood-state-dependent memory has typically 

been studied by having participants initially 

learn a list of words. Learning occurs in one 

mood state (e.g., happy or sad) and recall occurs 

in the same mood state or a different one (see 

Figure 15.6). The Þ ndings have been rather 

inconsistent. Ucros (1989) reviewed 40 studies, 

and found that there was only a moderate 

tendency for people to remember material 

better when there was a 
match
 between the 

mood at learning and that at retrieval. The 

effects were generally stronger when particip-

ants were in a p"
Segment_1049,"ositive mood than a negative   one, probably because individuals in a negative   mood are motivated to change their mood state   (see discussion below).

mood are motivated to change their mood state 

(see discussion below).
Kenealy (1997) noted various problems 
with previous research. First, the level of learning 

was generally not assessed, and so it is not clear 

whether poor performance reß
 ected deÞ cient 
memory or deÞ cient learning. Second, there 

was no check in some studies that the mood 

manipulations had been successful. Third, only 

one memory test was generally used, in spite 

of evidence suggesting that the extent of any 

mood-state-dependent effects on memory often 

depends on the nature of the memory test.

Kenealy (1997) addressed all these issues. 
Participants looked at a map and learned 
instructions concerning a particular route until 

their learning performance exceeded 80%. The 

following day they were given tests of free 

recall and cued recall (the visual outline of the 

map). There were strong mood-state-dependent 

effects in free recall but not in cued recall 

(see Figure 15.7). Thus, mood state can affect 

memory even when learning is controlled, 

but does so mainly when no other powerful 

retrieval cues are available.
How can we explain the inconsistent 
Þ
 ndings on mood-state-dependent memory? 
Eich (1995, p. 71) suggested the following 

Òdo-it-yourselfÓ principle: ÒThe more one must 

rely on internal resources, rather than on external 

aids, to generate both the target events them-

 t the do-it-
yourself principle Ð there was mood-state-

dependent memory when participants generated 

their own cues (i.e., free recall), but not when 

cues were provided (i.e., cued recall). The 

importance of internal processes at encoding 

was shown by Eich and Metcalfe (1989). There 

were read (e.g., ÒriverÐvalleyÓ) and generate 

(e.g., ÒriverÐvÓ) conditions. The participants 

completed the second word in the latter con-

dition during learning, and so it involved more 

use of internal processes. Subsequently there 

was free recall. Mood state (very pleasant or 

very unpleasant) was manipulated by having 

continuous music during learning and recall. 

The mood-state-dependent effect was 
four
 
times greater in the generate condition than in 

the read condition.
Mood-state-dependent memory: 
dissociative identity disorder
Bower (1994) argued that research on patients 
with 
dissociative identity disorder
 (previously 
called multiple personality disorder) was relevant 

to his network theory. Such patients have two 

or more separate identities or personalities. 

Bower predicted that patients with dissociative 

disorder should exhibit 
inter-identity amnesia
, 

in which each identity or personality claims 

amnesia for events experienced by other identities. 

According to Bower, inter-identity amnesia is 

an example of mood-state-dependent memory. 

Why is that? Each identity or personality has

its own characteristic mood state. As a result, 
a patientÕs mood state based on his/her cur-

rent 
identity may differ substantially from that 
associated with his/her other identities, thus 

making memories associated with those other 

identities relatively inaccessible. However, Bower 

claimed there should be less evidence of mood-

state-dependent effects such as inter-identity 

amnesia on tests of implicit memory (not involv-

ing conscious recollection). The stimuli relevant  

to implicit memory tests are ÒuncontrollableÓ 

or ÒobligatoryÓ (Bower, 1994, p. 230), and so 

not subject to mood-dependent states.
Before discussing the evidence, note that 
there are various reasons why patients with 

dissociative identity disorder might apparently 

fail to remember information previously learned  

by a different personality. The information 

may be genuinely inaccessible or deliberately 

withheld. Thus, it is very useful to include a 

control group of healthy individuals instructed 

to simulate the effects of inter-identity amnesia, 

presumably by deliberately withholding pre-

viously learned information.
Huntjens, Peters, Woertman, van der Hart, 
and Postma (2007) carried out a study in which 

patients with dissociative identity disorder 

learned a list of words (List A) in one identity 

and then learned a second list (List B) in 

another identity. After adopting the second 

identity and before learning List B, the patients 

all claimed a"
Segment_1052,"mnesia for List A. Finally, they   were tested for recall of List B words and for   recognition memory of both lists of words in   their second identity. If the patientsÕ claims of   inter-identity amnesia were correct, there should   have been no intrusions of List A words into   recall of List B a",Explores how perception influences cognition.,"perception, awareness, memory",Nested under Chapter on perception,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in awareness,Aligned with contemporary studies on attention,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_1394,"mnesia for List A. Finally, they 

were tested for recall of List B words and for 

recognition memory of both lists of words in 

their second identity. If the patientsÕ claims of 

inter-identity amnesia were correct, there should 

have been no intrusions of List A words into 

recall of List B and no recognition of List A 

words on the recognition test. In fact, however, 

the patients showed as many List A intrusions 

on recall as healthy participants instructed to 

simulate. In addition, while they recognised 

more List B than List A words, they recognised 

33% of List A words. The healthy simulators 

showed a similar pattern of results. Huntjens 

et al. (p. 787) concluded that patients with 

dissociative identity disorder Òseem to be 

characterised by the 
belief
 of being unable to 
recall information instead of an actual retrieval 

inabilityÓ.
Huntjens, Postma, Peters, Woertman, and 
van der Hart (2003) carried out an in 
genious 
study in which apparent inter-identity amnesia 

could 
not
 be shown simply by withholding 
responses. Dissociative pat
ients, healthy controls 
instructed to simulate inter-identity amnesia, 

and healthy controls not so instructed 
learned 

two lists (List A and List B). List A 
contained 

the names of vegetables, animals, and ß
 owers, 
and List B contained the names of different 

vegetables, different animals, and articles of 

furniture. The Þ rst two groups learned List A 

in one identity and then learned L
ist B in a 

different identity or a feigned 
identity. Finally, 

recall for List B was tested by free recall.
What Þ ndings would we expect? List B 
recall for the categories shared by both lists 

(i.e., vegetables and animals) should be subject 

to proactive interference (in which memory 

is disrupted by similar previous learning; see 

Chapter 6). However, there should be no pro-

active interference for the category unique to 

List B (articles of furniture). If patients with 

dissociative identity"
Segment_1053,"disorder have inter-identity   amnesia, they should  not  show proactive inter-  ference because the information from List A   would be inaccessible. In fact, all three groups   showed comparable amounts of proactive inter-  ference (see Figure 15.8), indicating that memory    of List A words disru",Explores how recognition influences cognition.,"emotion, recognition, memory",Nested under Chapter on attention,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in awareness,Aligned with contemporary studies on emotion,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_259," disorder have inter-identity

ference because the information from List A 

would be inaccessible. In fact, all three groups 

showed comparable amounts of proactive inter-

ference (see Figure 15.8), indicating that memory  

of List A words disrupted List B recall. It is 

striking that Huntjens et al. (2003) only analysed 

the data from dissociative patients with no 

memory of having learned List A!
BowerÕs (1994) assumption that dissocia-
tive patients should not exhibit mood-state-

dependent effects with implicit memory was 

tested by Huntjens, Postma, Woertman, van der 

Hart, and Peters (2005). Implicit memory was 

assessed using the serial reaction time task (see 

Chapter 6). On this task, a stimulus appears 

at one out of several locations on a computer 

screen and participants respond with the cor-

responding response key. The same repeating 

sequence of stimulus locations was used across 

several blocks, but participants were unaware 

of this. Implicit learning and memory are shown

by enhanced performance on the repeating 
sequence over 
blocks. The performance of 
the patients with dissociative identity disorder 

deteriorated when they switched identities in 

the middle of the experiment, suggesting there 

were mood-state-dependent effects and inter-

identity amnesia. However, the healthy controls 

simulating dissociative identity disorder showed 

the same pattern of results, so it is entirely 

possible the 
patients were simply simulating 
inter-identity amnesia.
Mood congruity
A common procedure to test for mood con-

gruity is as follows. First, a mood is induced, 

followed by the learning of a list or the reading 

of a story containing emotionally-toned 
mater-
ial. There is then 
a memory test for the list or 
story after the participant"
Segment_1054,"Õs mood has returned   to normal. Mood congruity is shown by recall   being greatest when the affective value of the   to-be-learned material  matches  the participantÕs   mood state at learning. Altern  atively, emotionally- toned material can be learned when the particip-  ant is in a neutral mood",Explores how perception influences cognition.,"memory, perception, awareness",Nested under Chapter on perception,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in awareness,Aligned with contemporary studies on awareness,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_1105,"Õs mood has returned 

to normal. Mood congruity is shown by recall 

being greatest when the affective value of the 

to-be-learned material 
matches
 the participantÕs 

mood state at learning. Altern 
atively, emotionally-
toned material can be learned when the particip-

ant is in a neutral mood state
. Mood congruity 
is shown if he/she recalls more information 

congruent than incongruent with his/her mood 

state at recall.
Bower, Gilligan, and Monteiro (1981) studied  
mood congruity. Participants hypnotised to feel 

happy or sad read a story about two college 

men, Jack and Andr”. Jack is very depressed 

because he is having problems with his academic  

work, his girlfriend, and his tennis. In contrast, 

Andr” is very happy, because things are going 

very well for him in all three areas. Participants 

identiÞ
 ed more with the story character whose 
mood resembled their own while reading the 

story. In addition, they recalled more informa-

tion about him.
There is more evidence of mood-congruent 
retrieval with positive than with negative affect. 

How can we explain this? The most plausible 

explanation is that people in a negative mood 

are much more likely to be motivated to change 

their mood. As Rusting and DeHart (2000, 

p. 738) expressed it, ÒWhen faced with an 

unpleasant emotional state, individuals may 

regulate their emotional states by retrieving pleas-

ant thoughts and memories, thus reducing o r 

reversing a negative mood-congruency 
effect.Ó
Rusting and DeHart (2000, p. 738) tested 
the above hypothesis. Participants were presented 

with positive, negative, and neutral words, and  

wrote a sentence containing each of them. After 

that, there was a negative mood induction in

which participants imagined experiencing dis-
tressing events. Then some participants engaged 

in positive reappraisal of the distressing events 

(e.g., ÒList some good things that could happen 

as a result of any of the negative events in the 

storiesÓ). Others were told to continue to focus 

on negative thoughts, and the control parti-

cipants were left free to choose the direction 

of their thoughts. Finally, everyone was given 

an unexpected test of free recall for all the 

words.
Participants in the continued focus condi-
tion showed the typical mood-congruity effect, 

whereas those in the positive reappraisal condi-

tion showed mood incongruity (see Figure 15.9). 

These effects were much stronger among 

participants who had previously indicated they 

were generally successful at regulating negative 

moods. Many failures to Þ
 nd mood-congruent 
effects probably occur because individuals in 

a negative mood are motivated to improve their 

mood.
Fiedler, Nickel, Muehlfriedel, and Unkelbach 
(2001) argued that there are two possible 

explanations of most mood-congruity effects. 

First, they may reß ect a genuine memorial 

advantage for mood-congruent material. Second, 
they may reß ect a response bias, with individuals 

being more willing to report memories matching 

their current mood state even if they are not 

genuine. In their study, they initially presented 

positive and negative words. After that, particip -

ants watched an amusing Þ
 lm (e.g., featuring 
Charlie Chaplin) or a distressing Þ lm (e.g., about  

a man awaiting the death penalty in prison) 

to induce a happy or sad mood, respectively. 

Finally, they were given a recognition memory 

test in which w"
Segment_1056,"ords were presented in a degraded   form so they could not be seen clearly. There   was no evidence that the mood-congruity effect   was due to response bias Ð if anything, parti-  cipants were  more  cautious in responding to  mood-congruent stimuli on the  recognition test.   Thus, mood congruity",Explores how perception influences cognition.,"memory, recognition, perception",Nested under Chapter on attention,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in emotion,Aligned with contemporary studies on attention,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_624,"ords were presented in a degraded 

form so they could not be seen clearly. There 

was no evidence that the mood-congruity effect 

was due to response bias Ð if anything, parti-

cipants were 
more 
cautious in responding to 
mood-congruent stimuli on the 
recognition test. 

Thus, mood congruity is a genuine memory 

effect.
According to BowerÕs (1981) theory, emo-
tional nodes are activated by stimuli having 

the appropriate affective value and by moods 

having the same affective value. Lewis, Critchley, 

Smith, and Dolan (2005) identiÞ
 ed those parts 
of the brain associated with happy and sad 

emotional nodes using functional magnetic 

resonance imaging (fMRI; see Glossary). Particip-

ants were presented with positive and negative 

words at study and then given a recognition-

memory test when in a happy or sad mood. 

The subgenual cingulate (see Figure 15.10) was 

activated when positive stimuli were presented 

and was re-activated when participants were 

in a positive mood at test. Thus, there may be 

ÒhappyÓ emotional nodes in this brain area. In 

similar fashion, the posteriolateral orbitofrontal 

cortex was activated when negative stimuli 

were presented and was re-activated when parti-

cipantsÕ mood at test was negative. This area 

is a likely site for ÒsadÓ emotional nodes.
Thought congruity
Thought congruity is very similar to mood 

congruity except that it applies outside the 

memory domain. Thought congruity has been 

studied in various ways. One method is to put 

participants into a positive or negative mood 

state before asking them to make certain judge-

ments. Thought congruity is shown if the

judgements are positive or lenient among parti-
cipants in a positive mood state but negative 

or harsh among those in a negative mood 

state.
Forgas and Locke (2005) provided good 
evidence for thought congruity. Experienced 

teachers were initially given a mood induction to  

put them into a happy or sad mood state. After 

that, they were given four vignettes describing 

workplace situations (e.g., a colleague cutting 

in front of you in a photocopying queue). For 

each vignette, the teachers made a judgement 

based on imagining themselves in the situation 

described. Mood state inß uenced the particip-

antsÕ judgements. More speciÞ
 cally, ÒHappy 
mood produced more optimistic and lenient 

causal attributions while those in a negative 

mood were more criticalÓ (p. 1071).
McFarland, Buehler, von Ruti, Nguyen, 
and Alvaro (2007) found important individual 

differences in thought congruity. They distin-

guished between two types of attention to the 

self. Some people have a 
ruminative
 approach 

involving a neurotic tendency to dwell on nega-
tive aspects of the self. Others have a 
reß ective
 

approach involving an open exploratory focus 

on the self. All participants 
visualised a negative 
or a neutral event from the 
previous year. Then 

they rated themselves or close others. Participants 

who generally adopt a ruminative approach 

showed more evidence of thought congruity than 

those who generally adopt a reß
 ective approach. 
Why didnÕt the reß ective individuals show thought 

congruity? 
They tend to deal with negative mood 
states by engaging in mood-repair strategies such 

as thinking positively or watching a favourite 

Þ lm.

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
in a review of mood-state-dependent memory. 
As was discussed earlier, the predicted effects 

of mood state on memory were obtained more 

often when free recall was used than recognition 

memory. Of relevance here, mood-state-dependent 

memory was found most consistently when the 

induced mood states were strong than when 

they were weak.
Evaluation
BowerÕs network theory has been extremely 

inß
 uential and opened up an entire research 
area. There is reasonable experimental support for
 
most of the predicted phenomena ß
 owing from 
the theory, including mood-state-dependent 

recall, mood congruity, and thought congruity. 

However, there have been many failures to 

obtain the predicted effects, due partly to the 

motivation of individuals in a negative mood 

to improve their mood.
There are several limitations with BowerÕs 
theoretical approach. First, it predicts that 

mood will inß uence cognitive processing more 

generally than actually happens. This issue is 

discussed in more detail shortly.
Second, as Forgas (1999, p. 597) pointed 
out, the theory, Òis notoriously difÞ
 cult to 
falsify. . . . The problem of falsiÞ
 ability mainly 
a"
Segment_1059,"rises because in practice it is difÞ cult to pro-  vide a complete  a priori  speciÞ cation of the   kind of cognitive contents likely to be activated   in any particular cognitive task.Ó Third, the theory is oversimpliÞ  ed.

vide a complete 
a priori
 speciÞ cation of the 

kind of cognitive contents likely to be activated 

in any particular cognitive task.Ó
Third, the theory is oversimpliÞ
 ed. Emotions 
or moods and cognitive concepts are both rep-

resented as nodes within a semantic network. 

However, moods typically change slowly in 

intensity over time whereas cognitions tend 

to be all-or-none, and there is rapid change 

from one cognition to another. As Power and 

Dalgleish (2008, p. 78) remarked, ÒA theory that 

gives emotions the same status as individual 

words or concepts is theoretically confused.Ó 

Worryingly, it seems to follow from the theory 

that anyone who heard or read the word, 

ÒpanicÓ, many times in quick succession would  

become extremely anxious!
Fourth, BowerÕs network theory is limited 
in its applicability, being explicitly designed 
only to represent the relations among individual 

words. For example, we saw earlier in the 

chapter that emotional states can be triggered 

by cognitive appraisals of complex ongoing 

situations. It is unclear how such appraisals 

could be incorporated into BowerÕs theory.
Affect infusion model
The affect infusion model (e.g., Bower & Forgas,  

2000; Forgas, 1995, 2002) resembles BowerÕs 

network theory but is broader in scope. The 

starting point for this model is the notion of 

affective infusion
, which occurs when affective 
information selectively inß
 uences attention, 
learning, memory, decision making and judge-

ment. At the heart of the model is the assumption  

that there are four processing strategies varying 

in the extent to which they involve affect 

infusion:
Direct access
(1) 
: This involves the strongly 
cued retrieval of stored cognitive contents 
and is not inß
 uenced by affect infusion. 
For example, our retrieval of strongly held 

political attitudes would not be altered 

by changes in mood.

Motivated processing strategy

:"
Segment_1060,"This involves  information processing being inß  uenced  by some strong, pre-existing objective (e.g.,  enhancing our current mood state).

strategy.

Heuristic processing
(3) 
: This strategy (which 
requires the least effort) involves using our 
current feelings as information inß
 uencing
 
our attitudes. For example, if asked how 

satisÞ
 ed we are with our lives, we might 
casually respond in a more positive way on  

a sunny day than an overcast one (Schwarz

& Clore, 1983). There is considerable 
affect infusion with this strategy.

Substantive processing
(4) 
: This strategy 
involves extensive and prolonged pro-
cessing. People using this strategy select, 

learn, and interpret information and then 

relate it to pre-existing knowledge. Affect 

often plays a major role when this strategy
 
is used, because it inß uences the infor-

mation used during cognitive processing. 

Use of this strategy typically produces 

Þ
 ndings in line with those predicted by 
BowerÕs network theory. The notion 
that 

affect is especially likely to inß
 uence 
cognitive processes when individuals use 

substantive processing resembles EichÕs 

(1995) Òdo-it-yourselfÓ principle discussed 

earlier.
How does the affect infusion model differ 
from BowerÕs (1981) network theory? The 

effects of mood or affect on cognition are 

predicted to be far less widespread on the 

affect infusion model than on network theory. 

The affect infusion model assumes that mood 

inß

Evidence
We will brieß
 y consider a few studies showing 
the use of each of the four processing strategies. 

Direct access is used mainly when judgements 

are made about familiar objects or events and 

so the relevant information is readily accessible 

in long-term memory. Salovey and Birnbaum 

(1989) found that mood did not inß
 uence esti-
mates of familiar positive healthy events (e.g., 

those involved in maintaining health, suggesting 

that participants used direct access. In contrast, 

mood did inßuence estimates of unfamiliar 

negative health events (e.g., chances of con-

tracting a given illness) about which participants 

possessed little relevant knowledge.
Forgas, Dunn, and Granland (2008) studied 
the effects of the direct access strategy on helping 

behaviour under naturalistic conditions. More 

and less experienced sales staff working in large  

department stores were exposed to a positive, 

negative, or neutral mood induction by some-

one pretending to be a customer. In the positive 

condition, the sales staff were told that the 

store looked great and the staff were very nice. 

In the negative condition, they were told the 

store looked terrible and the staff were rude. 

A few seconds after the mood induction, some-

one else who was apparently another customer 

asked for help in Þ nding a book that did not 

exist.
What do you think happened in this study? 
There was a mood-congruity effect for helping 

behaviour only among the less experienced 

staff (see Figure 15.11). Thus, less experienced 

staff were most likely to be helpful after the 

positive mood induction and least likely to be 

helpful following negative mood induction. 

Forgas et al. argued that the more ex"

recall of strongly held political attitudes.

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
We saw some evidence of this in the studies by 
Rusting and DeHart (2000) and by McFarland 

et al. (2007). Forgas (1991) asked happy or sad  

participants to select a work partner. Descrip-

tions a
bout potential partners were provided 
oninformation cards or a computer Þ
 le. Sad 
participants selectively searched for rewarding 

partners, whereas happy ones focused more on 

selecting task-competent partners. Thus, rather  

than showing mood-congruent processing, sad 

individuals actively tried to reduce their sad 

mood by selecting a supportive partner.
The strategy of heuristic processing (which 
requires the least amount of effort) involves 

using our current feelings as information in-

ß
 uencing our attitudes. For example, Schwarz 
and Clore (1983) found that people expressed 

more positive views about their happiness and 

life satisfaction when questioned on a sunny 

day rather than on a rainy, overcast day. They 

felt better when the weather was Þ ne, and this 

inß
 uenced their views about overall life satis-
faction. However, when participantsÕ attention 

was directed to the probable source of their 

mood (i.e., the weather) by a previous question, 

their mood state no longer inß
 uenced their 
views about life satisfaction. In those circum-

stances, superÞ
 cial heuristic processing was no 
longer feasible.

Participants 

made judgements about themselves involving 
central or peripheral self-conceptions. He argued 

that judgements about central self-conceptions 

are easily made and so should involve direct 

access. In contrast, judgements about peripheral 

self-conceptions require more extensive pro-

cessing and so involve substantive processing. 

As predicted from the affect infusion model, 

mood state influenced judgements of peri-

pheral self-conceptions but not those of central 

self-conceptions.
Evaluation
The theoretical assumption that affect or mood 

inß
 uences cognitive processing and judgements 
when certain processes are used (heuristic or 

substantive processing) has received reasonable 

support. Some of this support comes from 

studies designed to test BowerÕs (1981) network 

theory. There is also reasonable support for 

the additional assumption that affect or mood 

will not inß uence cognitive processing when 

other processes (direct access or motivated 

processing) are used. The affect infusion 

model has more general applicability than 

the network theory. It is also better equipped 

to explain non-signiÞcant effects of affect or 

mood on performance.
What are the limitations of the model? First, 
it is hard to test the model thoroughly, because 

there is often no direct evidence concerning the 

precise strategy used by individuals. Matters 

are complicated by ForgasÕs (2002) assumption

Second, even if we can identify the

 of 
processing strategy that participants are using 

on a given task, we still may not know the 

precise processes being used. For example, it 

is reasonable to assume that more extensive 

substantive processing is required to make 

unfamiliar judgements than familiar ones. 

However, it would be useful to know 
which
 

substantive processes are involved in the former 

case.
Third, the model does not focus enough 
on differences in processing associated with 

different mood states. For example, individuals 

in a positive mood tend to use heuristic pro-

cessing, whereas those in a negative mood use 

substantive processing. In one study, Chartrand 

et al. (2006) found that participants in a positive 

mood relied on superÞ cial stereotypical inform a -

tion, whereas those in a negative moodengaged 

in more detailed 
non-stereotypical 
processing.
Fourth, the affect infusion model basically 
focuses on the effects of good and bad moods 

on processing and behaviour. This is reß
 ected 
in most of the research in which happy and sad 

moods are compared. However, negative mood 

states (e.g., depressed versus anxious) often 

vary in their effects (see later discussion).
ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, 
AND COGNITIVE BIASES
Much of the research discussed in the previous 
section dealt with the effects of mood manipu-

lations on cognitive processing and performance.  

It is also possible to focus on cognitive process-

ing in individuals who are in a given mood state 

most of the time. For example, we can study 

patients suffering from an anxiety disorder or 

from depression. Alternatively, we can study 

healthy individuals having anxious or depressive 

personalities. These may sound like easy research 

strategies to adopt. However, a signiÞ
 cant 
problem is that individuals high in anxiety also 

tend to be high in depression, an"

This is the case in both normal and clinical 
populations, and it makes it hard to disentangle 

the effects of the two mood states.
One of the key differences between anxiety  
and depression concerns the negative events 

associated with each emotion. More speciÞ
 cally, 
past losses are associated mainly with depres-

sion, whereas future threats are associated mainly 

with anxiety. For example, Eysenck, Payne, 

and Santos (2006) presented participants with 

scenarios referring to severe negative events 

(e.g., 
the potential or actual diagnosis of a 
serious 
illness). There were three versions of each 
scenario 
depending on whether it referred to a  
past event, a 
future possible event, or a future 
probable event. Participants indicated how 

anxious or 
depressed each event would 
make 

them. Anxiety 
was associated more 
with future  
t han with past events, whereas the opposite was 

the case for depression (see Figure 15.12).
Why is it important to study cognitive pro-
cesses in anxious and depressed individuals? 

A key assumption made by many researchers 

in this area (e.g., Beck & Clark, 1997; Williams, 

Watts, Macleod, & Mathews, 1988, 1997) is that 

vulnerability to clinical anxiety and depression 

depends in part on various cognitive biases. A 

second key assumption is that cognitive therapy 

(and cognitive-behavioural therapy) should focus 

on reducing or eliminating these cognitive

It seems reasonable to assume that someone
possessing most (or all) of the above cognitive 

biases would be more likely than other people 

to develop an anxiety disorder or depression. 

However, as you have undoubtedly discovered,
 
things in psychology rarely turn out to be 

straightforward. We need to address two impor-

tant issues. First, do 
patients with an anxiety 
disorder or major depression typically possess 

all
 of these cognitive biases or only some of them? 

As we will see, theorists disagree among them-

selves concerning the answer to that question. 

Second, there is the causality issue. Suppose 

we Þ nd that most depressed patients possess 

various cognitive biases. Does that mean that 

the cognitive biases played a role in trigger-

ing the depression, or did the depression enhance 

the cognitive biases? Most of what follows 

represents various attempts to address these 

two issues.
Beck™s schema theory
Beck (e.g., 1976) has played a key role in the 

development of cognitive therapy for anxiety 

and depression. One of his central ideas is that 

some individuals have greater vulnerability 

than others to developing major depression or 

an anxiety disorder. Such vulnerability depends 
on the formation in early life of certain schemas 

or organised knowledge structures. According 

to Beck and Clark (1988, p. 20):
The schematic o"

A negative   cognitive trait is evident in the depressed   personÕs view of the self, world and  future.  . . .

clinically depressed is dominated by an 

overwhelming negativity. A negative 

cognitive trait is evident in the depressed 

personÕs view of the self, world and 
future. 
. . . In contrast, the maladaptive 
schemas in the anxious patient involve 

perceived physical or psychological 

threat to oneÕs personal domain as well 

as an exaggerated sense of vulnerability.
Beck and Clark (1988) assumed that schemas 
inß
 uence most cognitive processes such as 
attention, perception, learning, and retrieval 
of information. Schemas produce processing 

biases in which the processing of schema-

consistent or emotionally congruent infor
-
mation is favoured. Thus, individuals with 

anxiety-related schemas should selectively pro-

cess threatening information, and those with 

depressive schemas should selectively process 

emotionally negative information. While Beck 

and Clark emphasised the role of schemas 

in producing processing biases, they claimed 

that negative self-schemas would only become 

active and inß uence processing when the indi-

vidual was in an anxious or depressed state. The 
attentional bias:
 selective allocation of 
attention to threat-related stimuli when 

presented simultaneously with neutral stimuli.

interpretive bias:
 the tendency when 

presented with ambiguous stimuli or situations 

to interpret them in a relatively threatening way.

explicit memory bias:
 the retrieval of 

relatively more negative or unpleasant 

information than positive or neutral information 

on a test of 
explicit memory
.

implicit memory bias:
 relatively better 

memory performance for negative than for 

neutral or positive information on a test of 

implicit memory
.

activation of these self-schemas leads to negative

should typically possess all four of the cognitive 

biases described above. The reason is that the 

schemas allegedly have pervasive inß
 uences on 
cognitive processing. It is worth noting that 

essentially the same predictions follow from 

BowerÕs (1981) network theory, with its emphasis 

on mood-congruity effects.
Evidence relevant to BeckÕs theoretical 
approach will be discussed in detail shortly. 

However, we will mention two general limita-

tions of his approach here. First, evidence for 

the existence of any given schema is often based 

on a circular argument. Behavioural evidence 

of a cognitive bias is used to infer the presence 

of a schema, and then that schema is used 

to ÒexplainÓ the observed cognitive bias. Thus, 

there is generally no direct or independent 

evidence of the existence of a schema.
Second, Beck implied that self-schemas 
in depressed individuals are almost entirely 

negative. If that is the case, it is hard to see 

how their self-schemas or self-concept become 

positive during the process of recovery. Brewin, 

Smith, Power, and Furnham (1992) found that 

depressed individuals described themselves in 

mostly negative terms when asked to describe 

how they felt Òright nowÓ. However, and less 

consistent with BeckÕs approach, depressed 

individuals used approximately equal positive 

and negative terms when asked to describe 

themselves Òin generalÓ.
Williams,Watts, MacLeod, and 
Mathews (1997)
BowerÕs network theory and BeckÕs schema 
theory both predict that anxiety and depres-

sion should lead to a wide range of cognitive 

biases. As we will see, the effects of anxiety and  

depression are less wide-ranging than was 

assumed in those theories. In addition, the 

pattern of biases associated with anxiety and 

depression differs more than was implied by 

those earlier theories.
The above problems with previous theor-
etical approaches led Willia"
Segment_1069,"ms, Watts, Macleod,   and Mathews (1997) to put forward a new   theory.

and Mathews (1997) to put forward a new 

theory. Their starting point was that anxiety and 

depression fulÞ l different functions, and these 

different functions have important consequences 

for information processing. Anxiety has the 

function of anticipating danger or future threat, 

and so is Òassociated with a tendency to give 

priority to processing threatening stimuli; the 

encoding involved is predominantly perceptual 

rather than conceptual in natureÓ. In contrast, 

if depression involves the replacement of failed 

goals, Òthen the conceptual processing 
of inter-

nally generated material related to failure o r 

loss may be more relevant to this function than 

perceptual vigilanceÓ (p. 315).
The approach of Williams et al. (1997) 
is relevant to healthy individuals having an 

anxious or depressive personality as well as to 

patients suffering from an anxiety disorder or 

depression. In fact, we will be focusing mainly 

on Þ ndings from clinical samples. However, 

the general pattern of results is similar within 

healthy populations (see Eysenck, 1997, for a 

review).
Williams et al. (1997) made use of RoedigerÕs 
(1990) distinction between perceptual and 

conceptual processes. Perceptual processes are 

essentially data-driven, and are often relatively 

fast and ÒautomaticÓ. They are typically involved 

in basic attentional processes and in implicit 

memory. In contrast, conceptual processes are 

top-down, and are generally slower and more 

controlled than perceptual processes. They are 

typically involved in explicit memory (but can 

also be involved in attentional processes and 

implicit memory). Williams et al. assumed that 

anxiety facilitates the perceptual processing 

of threat-related stimuli, whereas depression 

facilitates the conceptual processing of threat-

ening information. This leads to various 

predictions:

Experimental evidence: cognitive 
biases
We will shortly be discussing evidence concern-
ing the existence of the four cognitive biases 

in clinically anxious and depressed groups. 

There are several anxiety disorders, including 

generalised anxiety disorder (chronic worry 

and anxiety about several life domains), panic 

disorder (frequent occurrence of panic attacks), 

post-traumatic stress disorder (anxiety and 

ß
 ashbacks associated with a previous traumatic 
event), and social phobia (extreme fear and 

avoidance of social situations). The most 

common form of clinical depression is major 

depressive disorder. It is characterised by 

sadness, depressed mood, tiredness, and loss 

of interest in various activities.
Attentional bias
Two main tasks have been used to study atten-

tional bias (see Eysenck, 1997, for a review). 

First, there is the dot-probe task. In the original 

version of this task, two words are presented 

at the same time, one to an upper and the other 

to a lower location on a computer screen. On 

critical trials, one word is emotionally nega-

tive 
(e.g. ÒstupidÓ; ÒfailureÓ) and the other is  
neutral,  
and they are generally presented for 
500 ms. 
The allocation of attention is assessed 

b y  recording speed of detection of a dot"

Therefore, attentional bias is indicated by a  consistent tendency for detection latencies to   be shorter when the dot replaces the negative   word rather than the neutral one.

can replace either word. It is assumed that 

detection latencies are shorter in attended areas. 

Therefore, attentional bias is indicated by a 
consistent tendency for detection latencies to 

be shorter when the dot replaces the negative 

word rather than the neutral one.
Attentional bias has also been studied by 
using the emotional Stroop task. The participants 

name the colour in which words are printed 

as rapidly as possible. Some of the words are 

emotionally negative whereas others are neutral. 

Attentional bias is shown if participants take 

longer to name the colours of emotionally nega-

tive words than neutral words on the assumption 

that the increased naming time occurs because 

emotionally negative words have been attended 

to more than neutral words. However, there has 

been much controversy concerning the appropriate 

interpretation of Þ ndings with the emotional 

Stroop task. For example, increased time to name 

the colours of emotionally negative words could 

be due to response inhibition or an attempt not 

to process the emotional word rather than to 

excessive attention to it (Dalgleish, 2005).
Bar-Haim, Lamy, Perganini, Bakermans-
Kranenburg, and van IJzendoorn (2007) carried 

out a meta-analysis on studies of attentional 

bias in anxious individuals. They distinguished 

between studies involving subliminal stimuli 

(i.e., presented below the level of conscious 

awareness) and those involving supraliminal 

stimuli (i.e., presented above the level of conscious 

awareness). There was very clear evidence of 

attentional bias with both kinds of stimuli, with 

the effects being slightly (but non-signiÞ
 cantly) 
greater with supraliminal stimuli. The magnitude 

of the attentional bias effect was broadly similar 

across all the anxiety disorders and normal 

participants high in trait anxiety (i.e., anxious 

personality). The only exception was that 

normal participants high in trait anxiety had 

a stronger att"

The fact that   attentional bias is found with both subliminal   and supraliminal stimuli suggests that various   p rocesses can be involved in producing the bias.   As Bar-Haim et al.

and supraliminal stimuli suggests that various

As Bar-Haim et al. (p. 17) concluded, ÒThe 

valence [emotion]-based bias in anxiety is a 

function of several cognitive processes, includ-

ing preattentive, attentional, and postattentive 

processes.Ó

COGNITION AND EMOTION

Williams et al. (1997) predicted that anxious  
individuals attend to threat-related stimuli early 
in processing, but subsequently direct their 

attention away from threat. The studies reviewed  

by Bar-Haim et al. (2007) provide strong sup-

port for the Þ rst prediction. Evidence relevant 

to both predictions was reported by Rinck and 

Becker (2005). Spider-fearful individuals and 

non-anxious controls were presented with four 

pictures at the same time: a spider, a butterß
 y, a 
dog, and a cat. As predicted, the Þ rst eye Þ
 xation  
on the visual display was more likely to be on the  

spider picture with the spider-fearful participants. 

Also as predicted, the spider-fearful participants  

rapidly moved their eyes away from the spider 

picture. In similar fashion, Calvo and Avero (2005) 

found attentional bias towards harm pictures 

in anxious individuals over the Þ rst 500 ms after 

stimulus onset, but this became attentional 

avoidance 1500Ð3000 ms after onset.
Fewer studies have considered the effects of 
depression on attentional bias, (see Donaldson, 

Lam, & Mathews, 2007, for a review). The 

most consistent Þ
 nding (or non-Þ
 nding) is that 
depressed individuals do not show an attentional 

bias when the stimuli are presented subliminally, 

which is as predicted by Williams et al. (1997). 

According to their theory, however, attentional 

bias in depression might be "
Segment_1073,"found if depressed   individuals had the time to process the negative   stimuli conceptually. This prediction was sup-  ported by Donaldson et al. (2007), using the   dot-probe task with patients suffering from major   depression. These patients showed attentional   bias when stimuli were presented",Explores how awareness influences cognition.,"awareness, attention, perception",Nested under Chapter on attention,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in attention,Aligned with contemporary studies on recognition,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_1248,"found if depressed 

individuals had the time to process the negative 

stimuli conceptually. This prediction was sup-

ported by Donaldson et al. (2007), using the 

dot-probe task with patients suffering from major 

depression. These patients showed attentional 

bias when stimuli were presented for 1000 ms but 

not when they were presented for only 500 ms 

(see Figure 15.13).
In sum, most of the Þ ndings on attentional 
bias are consistent with the theoretical position 

of Williams et al. (1997). Anxious individuals 

show an attentional bias early in processing 

(e.g., with subliminal stimuli) but avoid threat-

related stimuli later in processing. In contrast, 

depressed individuals do not show an atten-

tional bias with subliminal stimuli, and are 

most likely to show such a bias when stimuli 

are presented for relatively long periods of time 

(e.g., Donaldson et al., 2007).
Interpretive bias
There is general agreement that anxious and 

depressed individuals possess interpretive biases. 

So far as anxiety is concerned, Eysenck, MacLeod, 

and Mathews (1987) asked normal participants 

with varying levels of trait anxiety to write down 

the spellings of auditorily presented words. Some 

of the words were homophones having separate  

threat-related and neutral interpretations (e.g., 

die, dye; pain, pane). There was a correlation 

of 
+
0.60 between trait anxiety and the number 
of threatening homophone interpretations.
A potential problem with the homophone 
task is that participants may think of both 

spellings. In that case, their decisions as to which 

word to write down may involve response bias 

(e.g., selecting the spelling that is more socially 

desirable). Eysenck et al. (1991) assessed response 

bias using ambiguous sentences (e.g., ÒThe doctor 

examined little EmilyÕs growthÓ). Patients with 

generalised anxiety disorder were more likely 

than normal controls to interpret such sentences 

in a threatening fashion, and there we"

select more negative interpretations than nor-
mal controls. Such Þ ndings are limited in that 

they rely entirely on self-report data, which 

are very susceptible to response bias. In other 

words, depressed patients may 
report
 negative 

interpretations of ambiguous events but that 

does not necessarily mean that their 
actual
 

interpretations were negative.
The obvious way of dealing with the above  
problem is to assess interpretive bias 
without
 

making use of self-report data. This was done 

by Mogg, Bradbury, and Bradley (2006), in a 

study on patients with major depression and on 

normal controls. Participants were presented 

with ambiguous sentences, each of which was 

followed by a continuation sentence matching 

the negative or neutral interpretation of the 

preceding sentence. It was assumed that depressed 

patients would read the continuation sentences 

relatively faster when they were consistent with 

a  negative interpretation of the preceding 

sentence. In fact, however, the two groups did 

not differ, and so there was no"
Segment_1075,"evidence of inter-  pretive bias associated with depression. In sum, there is good evidence for an inter- pretive bias associated with anxiety. However,   it is less clear that there is also an interpretive   bias associated with depression. Mogg et al.   (2006) pointed out that the sentences they",Explores how attention influences cognition.,"memory, awareness, emotion",Nested under Chapter on attention,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in memory,Aligned with contemporary studies on emotion,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_630," evidence of inter-

In sum, there is good evidence for an inter-
pretive bias associated with anxiety. However, 

it is less clear that there is also an interpretive 

bias associated with depression. Mogg et al. 

(2006) pointed out that the sentences they used 

did not require participants to process them in 

a self-referential way. Thus, it may be the case 

that depressed individuals have an interpretive 

bias that is mostly limited to material that they 

process with respect to themselves.
Memory biases
Williams et al. (1997) concluded that explicit 

memory bias would be found more often in 

depressed than in anxious patients, whereas the 

opposite would be the case for implicit memory 

bias. We will start by considering memory biases 

in depression followed by anxiety. Rinck and 

Becker (2005) reviewed the literature, and co n -

cluded that depressed patients typicallye
xhibit 
an explicit memory bias.
Murray, Whitehouse, and Alloy (1999) raised 
an issue concerning the interpretation of this 

Þ
 nding. They asked normal individuals high and 
low in depression to perform a self-referential 

task (ÒDescribes you?Ó) on a series of positive 

and negative words. Then the participants pro-

vided free recall or forced recall, in which they 

were required to write down a large number of  

words. There was the typical explicit memory 

bias in depression with free recall but no bias 

at all with forced recall (see Figure 15.14). What  

do these Þ ndings mean? According to Murray 

et al. (p. 175), they Òimplicate an important 

contribution of diminished motivation and /or 

conservative report criterion in the manifesta-

tion of depression-related biases and deÞ
 cits 
in recall.Ó
Williams et al. (1997) claimed that no pub-
lished studies showed implicit memory bias in 

depressed individuals. Since 1997, however, there 

have been several reports of implicit memory 

bias in depression (e.g., Rinck & Beck"

601
However, Rinck and BeckerÕs demonstration 
of implicit memory bias involved patients 

with major depressive disorder. They argued 

that implicit memory bias is more likely to be 

found in individuals with a clinical level of 

depression.
Williams et al. (2007) concluded that there 
was much more evidence for implicit memory 

bias than for explicit memory bias in anxious 

individuals. More recent research has mostly 

indicated that anxious patients have an implicit 

memory bias but suggests they also have an 

explicit memory bias. Coles and Heimberg 

(2002), in a review, concluded that patients 

with each of the main anxiety disorders exhibit 

implicit memory bias. However, the evidence 

was weakest for social phobia, and Rinck and 

Becker (2005) failed to Þ nd an implicit memory 

bias in social phobics.
Coles and Heimberg (2002) found clear 
evidence in the literature for an explicit memory 

bias in panic disorder, post-traumatic stress 

disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. 

However, there was little support for this 

memory bias in generalised anxiety disorder 

or social phobia, and Rinck and Becker sub-

sequently found no evidence for explicit 

memory bias in social phobics.
Evaluation
There is convincing evidence that anxious and 

depressed individuals have various cognitive 

biases, and such evidence suggests that it is useful 

to consider anxiety and depression in terms "
Segment_1077,"of   cognitive processes. The evidence does not sup-  port predictions from BeckÕs schema-based theory   that anxious and depressed individuals should   show the  complete  range of attentional, inter-  pretive, and memory biases. For example, depressed   individuals do not seem to have an attention",Explores how awareness influences cognition.,"memory, recognition, awareness",Nested under Chapter on perception,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in awareness,Aligned with contemporary studies on memory,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_51,"of 

cognitive processes. The evidence does not sup-

port predictions from BeckÕs schema-based theory
 
that anxious and depressed individuals should 

show the 
complete
 range of attentional, inter-

pretive, and memory biases. For example, depressed 

individuals do not seem to have an attentional 

bias for subliminal stimuli, and there is not 

much evidence that depressed patients have an 

implicit memory bias.
How well does the theoretical approach of 
Williams et al. (1997) predict the main Þ
 ndings? 
At the most general level, their assumption that 

the pattern of cognitive biases differs between 

anxious and depressed individuals has received 
much support. The Þ ndings relating to attentional 

bias mostly conform to theoretical expectation. 

Anxious individuals show an attentional bias 

when perceptual processing is involved but not 

when conceptual processing is involved, and 

depressed individuals have the opposite pattern. 

As predicted, interpretive bias has been found 

many times in anxious and depressed individuals. 

However, much of the evidence on depressed 

individuals relies heavily on self-report data, 

and more deÞ
 nitive Þ
 ndings are needed. As 
predicted, there is strong evidence that depressed 

individuals have an explicit memory bias and 

that anxious individuals have an implicit memory 

bias. What is less consistent with Williams et al.  

is the existence of explicit memory bias in 

patients with various anxiety disorders (Coles 

& Heimberg, 2002) and some evidence of 

implicit memory bias in depressed individuals 

(e.g., Rinck & Becker, 2005).
The theoretical assumption that anxious 
individuals display very limited conceptual 

or elaborative processing in explicit memory 

seems implausible in some ways. Worry is a 

form of conceptual processing and it is very 

common in anxious individuals. For example, 

Eysenck and van Berkum (1992) found that 

worry frequency correlated 
+
0.65 with trait 

anxiety. In a"
Segment_1078,"ddition, persistent worrying is   the central symptom of generalised anxiety   disorder.

disorder. What is needed is a better understand-

ing of the circumstances in which anxious 

individuals do and do not exhibit conceptual 

or elaborative processing.
Causality issue: cognitive biases, 
anxiety, and depression
As mentioned earlier, evidence that patients 
with an anxiety disorder or major depressive 

disorder possess various cognitive biases 

can be interpreted in various ways. Of crucial 

importance is the direction of causality: do 

cognitive biases make individuals vulnerable 

to developing anxiety or depression or does 

having clinical anxiety or depression lead to 

the development of cognitive biases? Of course, 

it is also possible that the causality goes in both

directions. This issue is important. Cognitive 
biases have much greater practical and theoretical 

signiÞ
 cance if they help to cause clinical anxiety 
and depression than if they are merely the by-

products of a pre-existing disorder.
Attentional bias
If attentional biases play some role in the develop-

ment of anxiety disorders, then forms of therapy 

designed to reduce such biases might be expected 

to be beneficial. There is some supporting 

evidence (see Mobini & Grant, 2007, for a review).  

Adrian Wells has developed a form of attention 

training based on the assumption that we can only 

fully attend to a single stimulus or thought at any  

particular moment. Patients learn to improve 

their attentional control by carrying out exercises 

such as focusing successively on 
different stimuli. 

For example, social phobics can b e  
trained to 
attend less to their own negative thoughts and 

behaviour and more to external stimuli. Attention 

training has proved useful in the treatment of 

various anxiety disorders, including"
Segment_1079,"social phobia   and panic disorder  (e.g., Wells & Papageorgiou,   1998). However, it i s   concerned mainly with the  voluntary control of  attention. As Mobini and   Grant (2007) pointed  out, it remains to be seen  whether such training can  reduce relatively auto- matic and involuntary  attenti",Explores how emotion influences cognition.,"attention, memory, awareness",Nested under Chapter on attention,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in recognition,Aligned with contemporary studies on awareness,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_950," social phobia 

and panic disorder 
(e.g., Wells & Papageorgiou, 

1998). However, it i s

voluntary control of 
attention. As Mobini and  
Grant (2007) pointed 
out, it remains to be seen 
whether such training can 
reduce relatively auto-
matic and involuntary 
attentional biases.
Experimental evidence that changing atten-
tional biases can alter anxiety levels was reported 

by MacLeod, Rutherford, Campbell, Ebsworthy, 

and Holker (2002), in a study on healthy indi-

viduals. Some participants were trained to develop 

an attentional bias. This was done by altering the  

dot-probe task so that the target dot always 

appeared in the location in which the threatening 

word had been presented. In another group of 

participants, the target dot always appeared in the 

non-threat location. When both groups were 

exposed to a moderately stressful anagram task, 

those who had developed an attentional bias 

exhibited more anxiety than those in the other 

group.
Mathews and MacLeod (2002) discussed 
various studies producing results similar to those 

of MacLeod et al. (2002). They also investigated 

the effects of training healthy participants to 
develop an opposite attentional bias, i.e., selectively 

avoiding attending to threat-related stimuli. In 

one of their studies, they used only healthy 

participants high in the personality dimension 

of trait anxiety. There were two groups, both of  

which received 7500 training trials. The training 

for one group was designed to produce an opposite 

attentional bias, but this was not the case for 

the control group. Only the group that developed 

an opposite attentional bias showed a moderate 

reduction in their level of trait anxiety.
Interpretive bias
The Dysfunctional Attitude Scale has often been 

used to assess interpretive bias in clinical studies. 

It assesses unrealistic attitudes such as, ÒMy life 

is wasted unless I am a successÓ and ÒI should 

be happy all the ti"
Segment_1080,"meÓ. Some of this research   suggests that negative thoughts and attitudes are   caused by depression rather than the opposite   direction of causality (see Otto, Teachman, Cohen,   Soares, Vitonis, & Harlow, 2007, for a review).    For example, depressed patients typically have   much higher scores",Explores how memory influences cognition.,"perception, emotion, recognition",Nested under Chapter on awareness,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in emotion,Aligned with contemporary studies on awareness,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_508,"meÓ. Some of this research 

suggests that negative thoughts and attitudes are 

caused by depression rather than the opposite 

direction of causality (see Otto, Teachman, Cohen, 

Soares, Vitonis, & Harlow, 2007, for a review).  

For example, depressed patients typically have 

much higher scores than healthy controls on the  

Dysfunctional Attitude Scale. However, those 

who show full recovery from depressive symptoms 

often have scores that are nearly as low as those 

of healthy controls (e.g., Peselow, Robins, Block, 

Barsuche, & Fieve, 1990).
Reasonable evidence that negative and 
dysfunctional attitudes may be involved in the 

development of major depressive disorder was 

reported by Lewinsohn, Joiner, and Rohde 

(2001). At the outset of the study, they admin-

istered the Dysfunctional Attitude Scale to 

adolescents not having a major depressive dis-

order. One year later, Lewinsohn et al. assessed 

the negative life events experienced by the 

participants over the 12-month period. Those 

who experienced many negative life events had 

an increased likelihood of developing a major 

depressive disorder 
only
 if they were initially 

high in dysfunctional attitudes (see Figure 15.15). 

Since dysfunctional attitudes were assessed 

before
the onset of major depressive disorder, 

dysfunctional 
attitudes seem to be a risk factor 
for developing that disorder when exposed to 

stressful life events.

Supportive Þ ndings were also reported 
by Evans, Heron, Lewis, Araya, and Wolke 
(2005). They assessed negative or dysfunctional 

self-beliefs in women in the eighteenth week 

of pregnancy. Women with the highest scores 

for negative self-beliefs were 
60% more likely 

to become depressed sub 
sequently than those 
with the lowest scores. 
They even found that 

negative self-beliefs 
predicted the onset of 

"
Segment_1081,"depression three years later, which is strong   evidence that negative or dysfunctional beliefs   can play a role in causing depression. Experimental evidence suggesting that  changing interpretive biases has an impact on   anxiety was reported by Wilson, MacLeod,   Mathews, and Rutherford (2006), i",Explores how memory influences cognition.,"recognition, perception, awareness",Nested under Chapter on emotion,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in memory,Aligned with contemporary studies on perception,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_990,"depression three years later, which is strong

Experimental evidence suggesting that 
changing interpretive biases has an impact on 

anxiety was reported by Wilson, MacLeod, 

Mathews, and Rutherford (2006), in a study 

on students. They used homographs having a 

threatening and a neutral meaning (e.g., stroke; 

Þ
 t; sink). Extensive training was provided so 
that one group of participants would focus on 

the threatening interpretations of these homo-

graphs, whereas the other group would focus 

on the neutral inter pretations. After training, 

both groups were exposed to a video showing 

near-fatal accidents. The group trained to pro-

duce threatening homograph interpretations 

became more anxious than the other group 

during the showing of the video.
Mathews, Ridgeway, Cook, and Yiend (2007) 
trained healthy individuals high in trait anxiety 

to produce positive interpretations of various 

ambiguous events. This training produced a 

small (but signiÞ cant) reduction in the parti-
cipantsÕ level of trait anxiety. Thus, producing 

a positive interpretive bias can reduce anxiety 

just as producing a negative interpretive bias 

can increase anxiety.
Evaluation
There is an increasing amount of clinical and 

experimental research suggesting that atten-

tional and interpretive biases can have a causal 

effect on an individualÕs anxiety or depression. 

Of special importance is experimental evidence 
showing that training attentional and interp
re-
tive biases can inß
 uence peopleÕ
s subsequent 
mood state. As Mathews (2004, p. 133) a rg u ed , 

ÒNot only can training lead to per
sisting 

alterations in encoding bias, but con 
sequent 
mood changes have provided the most convincing 

evidence to date that such 
biases play a causal 

role in emotion
al vulnerability.Ó
The causality issue is a complex one, and 
so no deÞ nitive conclusions can be drawn. 

The "
Segment_1082,"experimental studies seem to provide the   strongest evidence that cognitive biases can   alter mood state.

Appraisal theories
†
According to LazarusÕ appraisal theory, emotional experience is determined by primary
appraisal, secondary appraisal, and reappraisal. It has been developed to include the

assumptions that each distinct emotion is elicited by a speciÞ 
c pattern of appraisal and
that appraisal can involve automatic associative or more controlled reasoning processes.

Individual differences in emotional reactions depend in part on differences in situational

appraisal. While appraisal often leads to emotional experience, it is also likely that

emotional experience can alter appraisals.
Emotionregulation
†
Situation selection, situation modiÞ
 cation, attentional deployment, appraisal, and response
modulation are all emotion-regulation strategies. Attentional deployment strategies include
distraction (which uses some"
Segment_1083,"of the limited capacity of working memory) and attentional  counter-regulation (which dampens positive and negative emotional states). Effective  cognitive reappraisals for negative stimuli involve early prefrontal activity leading to  reduced amygdala activity. However , the precise pattern of bra",Explores how memory influences cognition.,"attention, emotion, memory",Nested under Chapter on emotion,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in awareness,Aligned with contemporary studies on memory,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_813," of the limited capacity of working memory) and attentional

counter-regulation (which dampens positive and negative emotional states). Effective

cognitive reappraisals for negative stimuli involve early prefrontal activity leading to

reduced amygdala activity. However
, the precise pattern of brain activity depends on the
processes involved in any given form of reappraisal.
Multi-level theories
†
Multi-level theories provide explanations for the existence of emotional conß
 icts. LeDoux
identiÞ
 ed a slow-acting circuit in fear involving the cortex and a fast-acting one involving
the amygdala but bypassing the cortex. The existence of affective blindsight in brain-
damaged and healthy individuals provides evidence for non-conscious emotional processing.

According to the SPAARS model, emotion can be experienced via cognitive processing at

the schematic level or more automatically via the associative level. It is assumed within

the model that there are Þ 
ve basic emotions, each of which depends on what is currently
happening with respect to some valued goal. Several processes are identiÞ ed with the

SPAARS model, and the ways in which they interact remain unclear.
Mood and cognition
†
According to BowerÕs network theory, activation of an emotion node triggers activation
of emotion-related nodes. The theory predicts mood-state-dependent memory, mood

congruity, and thought congruity
. Findings sometimes fail to support the theory because
individuals in a negative mood try to improve it. The theory is oversimpliÞ
 ed, suffers
from a relative lack of falsiÞ
 ability, and minimises the differences between cognitions and

INTRODUCTION
The topic of consciousness is one of the most 

challenging (but most fascinating) in the whole 

of cognitive psychology. It has recently been 

the focus of a considerable amount of research. 

As we will see, this research has been very 

interesting and informative as researchers 

have had increasing success in grappling with 

important issues.
What exactly is ﬁconsciousnessﬂ? The term 
has been used in many different ways. It is ﬁthe 

normal mental condition of the waking state 

of humans, characterised by the experience of 

perceptions, thoughts, feelings, awareness of 

the external world, and often in humans . . . self-

awarenessﬂ (Colman, 2001, p. 160). According 

to Tononi and Koch (2008, p. 253), ﬁThe most 

important property of consciousness is that it 

is extraordinarily 
informative
. This is because, 

whenever you experience a particular conscious 

state, it rules out a huge number of alternative 

experiences.ﬂ
Pinker (1997) argued that we need to 
consider three somewhat different issues when 

trying to understand consciousness:

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
Humphrey (1983), the main function of con-
sciousness is social. Humans have lived in 

social groups for tens of thousands of years, 

and so have needed to predict, understand, and 

manipulate the behaviour of other people. This 

is much easier to do if you possess the ability 

to imagine yourself in someone else™s position. 

Humans developed conscious awareness of 

themselves, and this helped them to understand 

others. In the words of Humphrey (2002, p. 75), 

ﬁImagine that a new form of sense organ evolves, 

an ‚inner eye™, whose ˚ eld of view is not the 

outside world but the brain itself.ﬂ
Baars (1988, p. 347) claimed that conscious-
ness is ﬁthe jewel in the crownﬂ of our cognitive 

processing system. As such, he ascribed 18 

functions to it. These functions included adapt-

ation and learning, recruiting motor systems 

to organise and carry out mental and physical 

actions, decision making, self-monitoring, and 

self-maintenance. Baars (1997a, p. 7) argued 

that consciousness ﬁis a facility for accessing, 

disseminating
, 
and exchanging information
, and 
for 
exercising global co-ordination and
 
control
.ﬂ 
A potential limitation with this argument is that 

our conscious experience may not be identical 

to the outcomes of the cognitive processes 

identi˚
 ed by Baars (Velmans, 2009).
Controlling actions
It is often assumed that a major function of con-

sciousness is to control our actions. Every single 

day of our lives, we ˚ nd ourselves thinking

doing it (e.g., ﬁI think I™ll go and get myself a 

coffeeﬂ is following by us ˚ nding ourselves in 

a cafe drinking a cup of coffee). As Wegner 

(2003, p. 65) pointed out, ﬁIt certainly doesn™t 

take a rocket scientist to draw the obvious 

conclusion . . . consciousness is an active force, 

an engine of will.ﬂ
However, accumulating evidence by research-
ers such as Daniel Wegner and Benjamin Libet 

suggests it is wrong to assume that conscious 

intentions cause actions (see Haggard, 2005, 

f or a review). According to Wegner (2003), what 

we have is only the 
illusion
 
of conscious or free 
will. Our actions are actually determined by 
conscious awareness of ourselves. In the 

words of Pinker (1997), ﬁI cannot only 

feel pain and see red, but think to myself, 

‚Hey, here I am, Steve Pinker, feeling pain 

and seeing red!™ﬂ
As yet, cognitive neuroscientists and cognitive 
psychologists have shed little light on the issue 

of sentience and the origins of our sub 
jective 
experience. This is what Chalmers (1995b, p. 63) 

famously called the ﬁhard problemﬂ, which is 

ﬁthe question of how physical processes in the 

brain give rise to subjective experience.ﬂ Chalmers 

(1995a, pp. 201Œ203) spelled out in more 

detail the essence of the hard problem:
If any problem qualiÞ es as the problem 

of consciousness, it is this one . 
. . even 
when we have explained the performance 

of all the cognitive and behavioural 

functions in the vicinity of experience 

Ðperceptual discriminations,

categorisations, internal access, verbal 

report Ð there may still remain a further 

unanswered question: Why is the 

performance of these functions 

accompanied by experience? . . . Why 

doesnÕt all this information processing 

go on Òin the darkÓ, free of any feel?
The good news is that much progress has 
been made with what Chalmers (1995a, 1995b) 
described as ﬁeasy problemsﬂ. These problems 

(which are only relatively "
Segment_1088,"easy!) relate to Pinker™s   (1997) access-to-information issue. They include   understanding our ability to discriminate and   categorise environmental  stimuli, the integration  of information, our  ability to access our own  internal states, and the deliberate control of   behaviour (Chalmers, 200",Explores how memory influences cognition.,"emotion, perception, attention",Nested under Chapter on perception,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in emotion,Aligned with contemporary studies on memory,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_79,"easy!) relate to Pinker™s
 
(1997) access-to-information issue. They include 

understanding our ability to discriminate and 

categorise environmental 
stimuli, the integration 
of information, our 
ability to access our own 
internal states, and the deliberate control of 

behaviour (Chalmers, 2007). Solving most of 

these problems depends on 
developing a greater  
understanding of 
working memory (Bruce 

Bridgeman, personal communication).
Functions of consciousness

the functions of consciousness. According to

Similar ˚ ndings were reported by Pronin, 
Wegner, and McCarthy (2006) in a study on 
voodoo curses on American college students. 

Some participants encountered another per-

son (the ﬁvictimﬂ) who was offensive. After the 

encounter, they stuck pins into a voodoo doll 

representing the victim in his presence. When 

the victim subsequently reported a headache, 

participants tended to believe that their practice 

of voodoo had helped to cause his symptoms. 

They had this belief because their negative 

thoughts and actions about the victim occurred 

shortly before his symptoms developed.
The ˚ ndings reported by Wegner and 
Wheatley (1999) and by Pronin et al. (2006) are 

not
 the kiss of death for the notion that conscious 

intentions play an important role in determining 

our actions. In both studies, the set-up was very 

arti˚
 cial, and the study by Wegner and Wheatley  
was also complex. By analogy, no one would 

argue that visual perception is hopelessly fallible 

simply because we make mistakes when identify -

ing objects in a thick fog.
Very different ˚ndings casting additional 
doubt on the importance of conscious intentions 

in causing action were reported by Libet, Gleason, 

Wright, and Pearl (1983). Participants were 

asked to bend their wrist and ˚ ngers at a"

unconscious processes. However, we typically 

use the evidence available to us to draw the 

inference that our actions are determined by 

our conscious intentions. More speci˚
 cally,we 
infer that our conscious thoughts have caused 

our actions based on the principles of priority, 

consistency, and exclusivity: ﬁWhen a thought 

appears in consciousness just before an action 

(priority), is consistent with the action (con
sis-

tency), and is not accompanied by conspicuous 

alternative causes of the action (exclusivity), 

we experience conscious will and ascribe author-

ship to ourselves for the actionﬂ (Wegner, 2003, 

p.67).
Evidence supporting the above point of view 
was reported by Wegner and Wheatley (1999). 

They used a 20 cm square board mounted onto 

a computer mouse. There were two participants 

at a time, both of whom placed their ˚
 ngers 
on the same board. When they moved the board, 

this caused a cursor to move over a screen 

showing numerous pictures of small objects. 

Every 30 seconds or so, the participants were 

told to stop the cursor, and to indicate the extent 

to which they had consciously intended the 

cursor 
to stop where it did.
Both participants wore headphones. One 
participant was genuine, but the other was 

a confederate working for the experimenter. 

The genuine participant thought they were 

both hearing different words through the 

headphones. In fact, however, the confederate 

was actually receiving instructions to make 

certain movements. On crucial trials, the con-

federate was told to stop on a given object 

(e.g., cat), and the genuine participant heard 

the word ﬁcatﬂ 30 seconds before, 5 seconds 

before, 1 second before, or 1 second after 

the confederate stopped the cursor. Genuine 

participants wrongly believed they had caused 

the cursor to stop where it did when they heard  

the name of the object on which it stopped 

one or ˚ ve seconds before the stop (see Figure 

16.1). Thus, t"

were aware of a conscious decision from the 
apparent time of response. Banks and Isham 

(2009) used conditions in which participants 

either had their hand in full view or saw it at 

a 120-ms delay in a delayed video image. The 

reported decision time was 44 ms later in the 

latter condition than in the former. This ˚
 nding 
suggests that the reported time of conscious 

decisions is in˜ uenced by what happens
 after
 

the decision (i.e., perceived timing of their 

response).
Third, the Libet approach is essentially cor-
re 
lational, focusing on the relationship between 
event-related potentials and conscious aware-

ness. What is missing is the direct 
manipulation
 
of brain activity to observe its effects on con-

scious intentions. This gap has been ˚
 lled in 
the research to which we now turn.
Brasil-Neto, Pascual-Leone, Vallsole, Coher, 
and Hallett (1992) asked 
participants to 
choose 
whether to extend the left or the 
right index 

˚
 nger. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) 
applied to the motor area produced a systematic 

tendency for participants to choose 
the ˚
 nger on 
the side contralateral (on the oppo
site side of the 
body) to the site stimulated. This happened even 

though they were unaware that their choices 

ha"

As is discussed in the box, more compelling 

˚
 ndings have recently been obtained using a 
different paradigm.
Evaluation
Different kinds of research have converged on 

the counterintuitive ˚ nding that at least some 
of our decisions are prepared preconsciously 

some time before we are consciously aware of 

having made a decision. The most convincing 

evidence was reported by Soon et al. (2008; 

see Box), whose research has the advantage of 

focusing on parts of the brain known to be much 
involved in decision making. In addition, their 
key ˚
 
nding that brain activity predicted parti-
cipants™ decisions seven seconds before they 
of their choosing. The time at which they were 

consciously aware of the intention to perform 

the movement and the moment at which the 

hand muscles were 
activated were recorded. In  

addition, Libet et al.  
recorded event-related 
potentials (ERPs; see Glossary) in the brain to 

assess the readiness 
potential, which is thought  

to re˜
 ect pre-planning 
of a bodily movement.  
The key ˚ nding was that 
the readiness potential 
occurred 350 ms
 before 
participants reported 

having conscious aware
ness of the intention to  

bend the wrist and ˚
 ngers. 
In turn, conscious  
awareness preceded the actual 
hand movement  
by about 200 ms. According to 
Libet (1996, 

p.112), ﬁInitiation of the voluntary 
process is
developed unconsciously [as indexed by the 

readiness potential], well before there is any 

awareness of the intention to act.ﬂ
One limitation with Libet et al.™s (1983) 
˚
 ndings is that the readiness potential re˜
 ects 
very general anticipatory processes rather than 

any speci˚ c intention. What we need is a measure

This was done by Trevena 

and Miller (2002). They measured lateralised 

readiness potential, which differs depending 

on whether it is the right or the left hand that 

is going to be moved. There were three main 

˚
 ndings. First, they replicated Libet et al.™s (1983) 
˚
 nding that the readiness potential typically 
occurred well before participants reported con-

scious awareness of the decision concerning hand 

movement. Second, the lateralised readiness 

potential occurred some time 
after
 the readiness  
potential. Third, the mean onset of the lateral-

ised readiness potential was signi˚
 cantly
 earlier
 
than the mean reported decision time. Overall, 

these ˚ ndings suggest that voluntary initiation of 

a hand movement generally precedes conscious 

awareness, but by less time than claimed by 

Libet et al.
There are various limitations with research 
based on Libet™s paradigm. First, it is hard to study 

conscious intentions with precision, in part 

because ﬁthe conscious experience of intending is  

quite thin and evasiveﬂ (Haggard, 2005, p. 291).
Second, and related to the ˚
 rst point, 
people seem to infer the moment at which they

processes are heavily involved when decision 
making takes long periods of time.
Third, much of the research so far has been 
based on an oversimpli˚ ed view of intentional 

action. It typically depends on three different 

decisions: deciding 
what
 action to produce, 

deciding 
when
 to produce it, and deciding 
whether
 to produce it. This led Brass and 

Haggard (2008) to propose the What, When, 

Whether (WWW) model of intentional action, 

in which different brain areas are involved in 

the three different decisions.
Interesting evidence shedding some light on 
the complexities of brain processing involved in  

intentional action was reported by Desmurget, 

Reilly, "

There are three issues requiring future inves-
tigation. First, most research has involved trivial 

decisions (e.g., deciding which hand to move). 

It seems improbable that major decisions (e.g., 

Should I get married?; Should I move to 

Australia?) are prepared preconsciously.
Second, and related to the ˚
 rst point, most 
of the research is based on the assumption that 

people make decisions (consciously or precon-

sciously) and then implement them. In fact, 

however, much human decision making involves 

a lengthy process of con sidering and evaluating 

different kinds of relevant information (see 

Chapter 13). It seems very likely that conscious 
Brain reading and free will
Soon, Brass, Heinze, and Haynes (2008) argued 

that previous research was limited because it 

focused on the late stages of motor preparation 

in the supplementary motor area rather than on  

earlier high-level decision processes. Accordingly, 

they used functional magnetic resonance imaging 

(fMRI; see Glossary) to assess brain activation 

in the prefrontal and parietal cortex before 

participants decided whether to make a response 

with their left or right index Þ nger. Soon et al. 

hoped to Þ
 nd differences in the pattern of brain 
activation depending on which decision was made  

by participants.The Þ ndings were dramatic.The 

decision that participants were going to make 

could be predicted on the basis of brain activity 

in frontopolar cortex (BA10) and an area of 

parietal cortex running from the precuneus into 

posterior cingulate cortex seven seconds before 

they were consciously aware of their decision! 

In addition, activity in the supplemental and

different brain areas are involved in working 

out 
which
 decision to make and 
when
 to imple-
ment it.
The Þ ndings reported by Soon et al. (2008) 
represent probably the strongest evidence to 

date that our actions may depend much less on 

conscious intentions than we like to think. In 

previous research, the time interval between 

certain events in the brain and participantsÕ 

responses was so small that it was not very 

clear that conscious awareness occurred 
after
 the  

brain events.There are no such concerns with 

the seven-second gap reported by Soon et al. 

As John-Dylan Haynes (one of the researchers) 

concluded, ÒYour decisions are strongly prepared 

by brain activity. By the time consciousness kicks 

in, most of the work has already been done.Ó 

However, brain activity did not 
always
 predict 

participantsÕ subsequent decisions accurately, so 

it is possible that additional factors (e.g., free 

will) were involved on at least some trials.
The research of Soon et al. (2008) potentially 
raises some important ethical and legal issues 

relating to the whole notion of personal respon-

sibility. As Gazzaniga (2008, p. 413) asked, ÒIf it 

is simply the brain . . . that causes a person to 

act (even before he or she is aware of making

Post-decision wagering provides a fairly

large sums of money. That was so even when 

they were instructed as follows: ﬁIt is okay to 

be high all of the time Œ try to ‚go for it™ [bet

It is possible that GY™s reluctance to bet much 

money when he had correctly guessed that a 

stimulus had been presented to his affected 

visual ˚
 eld re˜
 ected his betting strategy rather 
than a lack of conscious awareness.
In spite of the popularity of relying on 
behavioural measures, the evidence obtained 

from using them is often hard to interpret. 

As Lamme (2006, p. 499) pointed out, one of 

the key problems is as follows: ﬁYou cannot 

know whether you have a conscious experience 

without resorting to cognitive functions such 

as attention, memory or inner speech.ﬂ Thus, 

failure to report a given conscious experience 

may be due to failures of attention, memory, 

or inner speech rather than to absence of the 

relevant conscious experience. For example, 

change blindness (the failure to detect a change 

when two views of the same scene are presented 

successively) may be due mainly to the absence 

of attention rather than lack of relevant con-

scious experience (e.g., Landman, Spekreijse, 

& Lamme, 2003; see Chapter 4). Another 

example concerns split-brain patients, whose 

two brain hemispheres are disconnected from 

each other (see discussion later in this chapter). 

Such patients have very limited ability to pro-

vide verbal reports on objects presented to the 

right or non-language hemisphere. It is often 

unclear whether this re˜ ects a lack of conscious 

experience in the right hemisphere or a de˚
 cit 
in right-hemisphere language abilities.
A classic example of the limitations of 
verbal report was shown by Sperling (1960; 
to awaken patients undergoing brain surgery. 

Stimulation of the posterior parietal cortex caused 

the patients to have a strong desire to move a 

part of their body "

spect of clarifying the rela tionship between con-

scious intentions to perform actions and the 

triggering of such actions.
MEASURING CONSCIOUS 
EXPERIENCE
Much of the research on conscious experience 
has focused on visual consciousness Œ our 
aware-
ness of visual objects. The main advantages o f  

studying visual consciousness are that it is pos-

sible to control what is presented to participants 

and whether stimuli are or are not con
sciously  
perceived. What is the best way to assess 
people™s 
visual consciousness? Overwhelmingly, 
the most 
popular answer has been that we should u s e  

behavioural measures. For example, we can ask 

them to provide verbal reports of their visual 

experience, or to make a yes/no decision con-

cerning the presence of a target object.
In post-decision wagering, observers initially 
decide whether a stimulus was present and then 

decide how much to wager or bet on their 

decision (Persaud, McLeod, & Cowey, 2007). 

Wagers should be large and mostly successful 

if observers™ conscious awareness is high, whereas 

they should be small and inaccurate if conscious 

awareness is lacking. Persaud et al. tested GY, 

a patient with blindsight (a condition in which 

accurate visual discriminations are made without 

reported conscious awareness; see Chapter 2). 

When GY decided whether a stimulus had been 

presented to his affected visual ˚ eld, he was 

correct 70% of the time. However, he showed 

only a modest tendency to bet more money on 

correct trials than on incorrect ones, strongly 

suggesting that he generally lacked relevant 

conscious awareness. In contrast, when stimuli

Another problem with using behavioural 
measures to assess conscious awareness is that 
different measures often fail to agree. For example, 

consider research on subliminal perception 

(see Chapter 2). Observers sometimes show 

ﬁawarenessﬂ of visual stimuli when asked to make 

forced-choice decisions about them (objective 

threshold) but not when asked to report their 

experience (subjective threshold).
see Chapter 6). He presented visual displays 

of three rows of four letters very brie˜
 y and 
found that participants could recall only four 

or ˚ve of them. This suggested there was very 

limited conscious awareness of the display. 

However, Sperling (1960) and Landman et al. 

(2003) found that this was due more to memory 

limitations when reporting the letters than to 

strict limits on conscious awareness.
The vegetative state: Behavioural versus functional neuroimaging 
measures of consciousness
The limitations of behavioural evidence for con-
scious awareness have been shown in research 

on the 
vegetative state
, which is deÞ ned by the 

following criteria: ÒThere must be no evidence 

of awareness of self or environment, no response 

to external stimuli of a kind suggesting volition 

or purpose, and no evidence of language com-

prehension or expressionÓ (Owen & Coleman, 

2008, p. 235).The vegetative state is found in 

brain-damaged patients who emerge from a coma 

and display Òwakefulness without awarenessÓ. 

Thus, the behavioural evidence indicates very 

strongly that patients in the vegetative state 

totally lack conscious awareness.
Important research by Owen, Coleman, Boly, 
Davis, Laureys, and Pickard (2006) using functional 

neuroimaging has suggested that these patients 

may possess some conscious awareness.They 

studied a 23-year-old woman in the vegetative state 

as a result of a very serious road accident in July  

2005. She was asked to imagine playing a gam"

of tennis or visiting the rooms of her house 

starting from the front door.These two tasks were 

associated with different patterns of brain activity 

as assessed by functional magnetic resonance 

imaging (fMRI; see Glossary) Ð for example, only 

imagining playing tennis was associated with 
activation in the supplementary motor area. Of 

key importance, the patterns of brain activity were 

very similar to those shown by healthy partici-

pants.This brain activation was not triggered 

automatically by the words ÒtennisÓ or ÒhouseÓ: 

it lasted for the entire 30 seconds of each trial 

and included brain areas that do not respond 

automatically to familiar words.
Owen et al. (2006) carried out another test 
of the patientÕs conscious awareness. She was 

presented with sentences containing ambiguous 

words (italicised) (e.g., ÒThe 
creak
 came from a 
beam
 
in the 
ceiling
Ó). She showed greater brain activity in  

the left inferior frontal region to ambiguous than 

to non-ambiguous words, showing that she engaged 

in full semantic processing of the sentences.
These Þ ndings suggest that the patient was 
consciously aware and purposefully following 

instructions (see Owen & Coleman, 2008, for 

a review). Of particular relevance to the current  

discussion, these Þ
 ndings suggest that functional 
neuroimaging sometimes provides a more valid 

assessment of the presence of conscious experi-

ence than behavioural measures. However, it is 

possible (although unlikely) that the patientÕs 

brain activity reß ected unconscious but relatively 

sophisticated processing.
vegetative state:
 a condition produced by brain damage in which there is wakefulness but an apparent 
lack of awareness and purposeful behaviour.

Evidence
When an initial visual stimulus is followed 
shortly afterwards by"
Segment_1099,"a second visual stimulus,   the second stimulus often prevents conscious   perception of the ˚ rst. This effect is known as   masking, and the issue arises as to whether   masking  is due to disruption of the feedforward   sweep or of recurrent processing.

the second stimulus often prevents conscious 

perception of the ˚ rst. This effect is known as 

masking, and the issue arises as to whether 

masking
 is due to disruption of the feedforward 

sweep or of recurrent processing. Fahrenfort, 

Scholte, and Lamme (2007) asked participants to 

decide whether a given target ˚ gure (a texture-

de˚
 ned square) had been presented using 
non-masked and masked conditions. The EEG 

evidence indicated that feedforward processing  

was intact under masked conditions even when 

participants™ target-detection performance was 

at chance level. In contrast, there was practically 

no evidence of recurrent processing in the masked 

condition. These ˚ ndings suggest that recurrent 

processing can be necessary for conscious aware-

ness, but it may well not be suf˚
 cient.
Fahrenfort, Scholte, and Lamme (2008) 
carried out a similar EEG study in which parti-

cipants tried to detect masked visual targets. 

They identi˚ ed an initial stage of feedforward 

processing followed by four stages of recurrent 

processing involving alternating fronto-parietal 

and occipital activity. The amount of feedforward 

activity did not correlate with target-detection 

performance. However, recurrent processing 

activity at all stages correlated highly with per-

formance. These ˚ ndings suggest that con 
scious  
experience is associated much more with recurrent 

processing than with feedforward processing.
The data obtained by Fahrenfort et al. (2007,  
2008) are essentially correlational, and do 

not provide direct evidence that recurrent pro-

cessing is essential for visual consciousness. 

The causal issue has been addressed by several 

researchers (e.g., Boyer, Harrison, & Ro, 2005; 

Corthout, Uttle, Ziemann, Cowey, & Hallett, 
Neural correlates of

Going one",Explores how attention influences cognition.,"emotion, awareness, memory",Nested under Chapter on attention,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in emotion,Aligned with contemporary studies on emotion,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_1286,"cious-

ness. What happens is that we obtain behavioural 

measures of conscious awareness, and relate 

them to the associated patterns of brain activity. 

Some of the relevant research is discussed here, 

with other research on neural correlates of con-

sciousness considered shortly.
Going one step further, Lamme (2006) 
argued that it might be preferable to de˚
 ne con-
sciousness in neural terms instead of behavioural 

ones. He focused on visual consciousness, i.e., 

conscious experience of visual objects. Presenta-

tion of a visual stimulus leads to extremely rapid,  

essentially automatic processing at successive 

levels of the visual cortex, starting with early 

visual cortex and then proceeding to higher 

levels (see Chapter 2). This so-called ‚feedfor-

ward sweep™ is completed within about 100Œ

150 ms. The feedforward sweep is followed by 

recurrent processing (also known as re-entrant 

processing). Recurrent processing involves 

feedback from higher to lower areas, producing 

extensive interactions between different areas. 

According to Lamme (2006), the relevance of 

all this to conscious experience is very direct 

Œrecurrent processing is accompanied by

conscious experience, whereas the feedforward 

sweep is not.
Why
 does conscious experience seem to be 
associated with recurrent processing rather than 

the feedforward sweep? The simple (and honest) 

answer is that we do not know. However, here 

are three relevant considerations. First, it seems 

more plausible that consciousness is associated 

with the complexity of recurrent processing 

rather than the very straightforward feed-

forward sweep. Second, there are enormous 

numbers of back connections in the cerebral 

cortex (Tononi & Koch, 2008), making it prob-

able that they serve some important purpose. 

Third, Lamme (2006) argued that we need con-

sciousness to learn and that recurrent processing 

plays an important role in learning.

white vowels. Some times additional square ˚
 gures 
were present. These ˚
 gures produced recurrent 
processing, but 50% of participants reported 
afterwards that they had not seen them. It was 

only when there was widespread recurrent pro-

cessing that the ˚ gures were consistently seen. 

The interpretation of these ˚ ndings is somewhat 

ambiguous. The failure to report seeing the ˚
 gures 
when associated with modest amounts of recur-

rent processing may mean that fairly extensive 

recurrent processing is needed for conscious 

perception. Alternatively, it may be that only 

modest recurrent processing is needed for con-

scious perception, but memory failures impaired 

participants™ ability to report their conscious 

experience. Another possibility is that recurrent 

processing needs to be accompanied by selective 

attention to become conscious (Max Velmans, 

personal communication).
BRAIN AREAS ASSOCIATED 
WITH CONSCIOUSNESS
There has been considerable interest in recent 
years in trying to locate the brain areas most 

associated with conscious visual awareness. 

Before proceeding, it must be emphasised 

that no one believes that simple answers will 

be forthcoming or that certain brain areas are 

always
 involved in conscious visual awareness. 

With that in mind, how should we proceed? 

What is needed is to compare patterns of brain 

activation associated with visual processing lead-

ing t o  
conscious awareness with 
those associated 
with visual processing 
not
 leading to awareness. 

Several paradigms have been used for this 

purpose (see Kim & Blake, 2005, for a review), 

and three of them are discussed below.
First, there is masking (discussed above), 
in which a target"
Segment_1102,stimulus is shortly followed   by a masking stimulus that prevents conscious   perception of the target stimulus. This masked   condition can be compared with a non-masked   condition in which the target stimulus is con-  sciously perceived.

by a masking stimulus that prevents conscious 

perception of the target stimulus. This masked 

condition can be compared with a non-masked 

condition in which the target stimulus is con-

sciously perceived. This paradigm is effective a t  

producing the presence or absence 
of conscious 

perception. However, the physical stimulation 
1999) using transcranial magnetic stimulation 

(TMS; see Glossary). TMS was applied to early  

visual cortex (V1) at different time i
ntervals 

after the presentation of a visual 
stimulus. 
Conscious perception of the stimulus was 

suppressed when TMS was administered about 

100 ms after the stimulus, but not when it was 

presented less than 80 ms afterwards. What is 

the signi˚ cance of these ˚
 ndings? Since 
feed-
forward reaches V1 about 35 ms afte
r stimulus 
presentation, it is unlikely that TMS 
disrupted 
the feedforward sweep. It is much more likely 

that TMS disrupted subsequent recurrent pro-

cessing starting about 100 ms after stimulus 

onset, suggesting that recurrent 
processing is 

needed for conscious perception.
Evaluation
The possibility of using recurrent processing 

as a neural index or marker of consciousness 

is an exciting one. As we have seen, we may fail  

to detect conscious awareness with behavioural 

measures because of problems relating to atten-

tion, memory, or language. It is possible that 

recurrent processing is less affected by these other 

cognitive functions than are most behavioural 

measures, but more evidence is needed before 

reaching any clear conclusions. In addition, 

there is accumulating evidence that conscious 

awareness is associated with recurrent processing 

but not with the feedforward sweep.
What are the limitations of Lamme™s (2006) 
approach? First, it focuses explicitly on 
visual
 

consciousness. As a consequence, it is uninfor-

mative about the processes involved when we are 

consciously aware of past or future event"

 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT™S HANDBOOK
(2002, p. 47) reviewed 13 studies in which 
conscious and non-conscious conditions were 

compared, and concluded: ﬁConscious per-

ception . . . enables access to widespread brain 

sources, whereas unconscious input processing 

is limited to sensory regions.ﬂ
In fact, several studies indicate that the 
processing of masked visual stimuli can be 

greater than implied by Baars™ conclusion. For 

example, Rees (2007) discussed an unpublished 

experiment on binocular rivalry he carried out 

with colleagues in which observers were presented 

with pictures of faces and houses, one to each 

eye. Functional neuroimaging (fMRI) was used 

to assess activation in brain areas associated 

with face processing (the fusiform face area) 

and object processing (parahippocampal place 

area). They key ˚ nding was that it was possible 

to predict the identity of the suppressed (uncon-

scious) stimulus with almost 90% accuracy by 

studying the brain activation pattern in those 

brain areas. Thus, even suppressed stimuli were 

processed at high levels of the visual system.
Kiefer and Brendel (2006) used a lexical 
decision task in which participants decided 

whether letter strings formed words, with the 

letter strings being preceded by masked stimuli 

that "
Segment_1104,"could not be perceived consciously.

tive to semantic processing. The amplitude of

differs in the masked and non-masked 
con-

ditions, making it hard to interpret dif
ferences 
in brain activation in the two con ditions. This 

can be overcome by focusing on the masked 

condition and comparing brain activation when 

the target stimulus is or is not detected.
Second, there is 
binocular rivalry
. This 
involves a paradigm in which two visual stimuli 

are presented (one to each eye) for a period of 

time. Observers perceive only one stimulus at 

any time, with the stimulus being consciously 

perceived alternating over time. Binocular rivalry 

provides an effective way of assessing brain 

activity associated with conscious awareness. 

The reason is that there are shifts in conscious 

content as the stimulus being perceived varies 

without any changes in the stimuli themselves.
Third, there are paradigms in which lack of  
conscious awareness is apparently due to dis-

tracted attention. Examples include inattentional  

blindness and change blindness (see Chapter 4).  

Inattentional blindness occurs when the presence 

of an unexpected object in a visual display is not  

consciously detected. Change blindness occurs 

when observers fail to detect some change in 

the visual environment. Inattentional blindness 

and change blindness are both phenomena that 

occur in everyday life and so possess ecologic"

However, it is often hard to be sure   that failures to report the unexpected object or    the visual change are due to failures of con-  scious experience rather than to limitations of   attention or memory (see Chapter 4).

that failures to report the unexpected object or  

the visual change are due to failures of con-

scious experience rather than to limitations of 

attention or memory (see Chapter 4).
Evidence
We will start by considering the brain areas 

activated during the processing of visual stimuli 

that are not consciously perceived. Some evidence 

suggests that such processing is very limited. 

For example, Dehaene et al. (2001) compared 

brain activation during conscious perception 

of visually presented words with subliminal 

presentation (and no conscious perception) 

of the same words. Activation was largely con-

˚
 nedt o  
the visual cortex when the words were 
presented subliminally. However, there was wide-

spread visual, parietal, and frontal activation 

when they were consciously perceived. Baars 
binocular rivalry:
 this occurs when an observer  
perceives only one visual stimulus when two 

different stimuli are presented (one to each eye); 

the stimulus seen alternates over time.

This ˚ nding suggested that this area was asso-

temporal activity and only visual awareness was 

associated with parietal activity. Thus, conscious 

awareness in the auditory and visual modalities 

is associated with a mixture of common and 

speci˚
 c brain activations.
Rees (2007) reviewed ˚ ndings from studies 
in which the focus was on brain activation 

associated with changes in visual awareness. 

There was a clear clustering of activation in the 

superior parietal and dorsolateral prefrontal 

cortex (see Figure 16.2), areas that are outside 

visual cortex. Of particular note, similar ˚
 ndings 
were reported across several different paradigms, 

including binocular rivalry, successful identi˚
 ca-
tion of visually masked words, and the detection 

of change in a visually presented object.
One of the problems in interpreting most 
of the evidence is that there is typically more 

effective information processing on trials asso-

ciated with conscious awareness than on trials 

not associated with conscious awareness. Thus, 

it is sometimes hard to decide whether brain 

activity reflects conscious awareness rather 

than simply effective information processing. 

Lau and Passingham (2006) carried out a study 

on masking in which performance levels were 

the same for conditions associated with or 
There is further evidence that stimuli that 
are not consciously perceived can be processed 

in terms of their meaning. For example, there 

is the phenomenon of affective blindsight (see 

Chapter 15). In this phenomenon, the emotional 

signi˚
 cance of emotional stimuli (e.g., faces) 
is processed even though the observer has 

no conscious awareness of the stimuli (Pegna, 

Khateb, Lazeyras, & Seghier, 2005).
What conclusions can we draw? According 
to Rees (2007, p. 878), ﬁAl"
Segment_1107,"l visually responsive   cortical areas appear to show evidence for   unconscious visual processing.ﬂ However, uncon-  scious visual processing is typically associated   with a much smaller increase in activity in these   areas than in conscious visual processing.

unconscious visual processing.ﬂ However, uncon-

scious visual processing is typically associated 

with a much smaller increase in activity in these 

areas than in conscious visual processing.
We turn now to major differences in brain 
activation between stimuli that are consciously 

perceived and those that are not. Lumer, Friston, 

and Rees (1998) studied binocular rivalry. 

Observers were presented with a red drifting 

grating to one eye and a green face to the 

other, and they pressed keys to indicate which 

stimulus they were perceiving. Lumer et al. 

used fMRI to identify the brain areas especially 

active immediately prior to a switch in con-

scious perception from one stimulus to the 

other. The anterior cingulate and the prefrontal 

cortex were among the several areas showing 

increased activation during shifts in conscious 

perception.
McIntosh, Rajah, and Lobaugh (1999) 
adopted the strategy of analysing brain activa-

tion data separately for those participants who 

did or did not become aware of some aspect 

of the experimental situation. They carried out 

a PET study on associative learning. There were 

two visual stimuli, and the task was to respond  

to one of them (the target) but not to the other. 

There were also two tones, one predicting that 

a visual stimulus would be presented and the 

other predicting the absence of a visual stimulus. 

The participants were divided into those who 

noticed the association between the auditory 

and visual stimuli (the aware group) and those 

who did not (the unaware group).
McIntosh et al. (1999) found that the great-
est difference between the two groups in the 

brain activity produced by the tones was in the

It is noteworthy that neglect patients fail to 

show conscious awareness of visual stimuli even 

when there is activation of several areas of 

visual 
cortex (Driver, Vuilleumier, Eimer, & 
Rees, 2001).
Extinction involves failing to detect stimuli 
presented to the side opposite to the brain dam-

age 
when another stimulus is presented at the 
same time to the same side as the brain damage, 

and generally involves parietal damage. Extinction 

patients are often consciously aware of some 

visual stimuli, and such awareness is associated 

with integrated activity between visual cortical 

areas and undamaged parietal and prefrontal 

regions (Vuilleumier & Driver, 2007).
Evaluation
Visual stimuli that are not consciously perceived 

are often associated with modest activation of 

most of the visual brain areas activated during 

conscious visual perception. That suggests that 

there can be extensive processing of visual 

stimuli of which the observer has no conscious 

awareness. There is consistent evidence that 

visual consciousness is associated with activation 

in prefrontal cortex and parietal cortex, and the 

anterior cingulate can also be involved. Research 

using TMS (e.g., Beck et al., 2006; Turatto et al.,  

2004) has strengthened the argument that pre-

frontal cortex and parietal cortex are necessary 

for visual awareness.
What are the limitations of research in this 
area? First, it has focused on which brain areas 

are involved in visual consciousness, leaving 

it unclear whether the same brain areas are 

involved in other situations. However, relevant 

evidence was reported by Addis, Wong, and 

Schacter (2007). They asked participants to 

think of (and elaborate on) various past and 

future events (see Chapter 7), tasks requiring 

conscious awareness of the events in question. 

Several brain regions were activated during the 

elaboration of both past and future events, 

inclu"
Segment_1109,"ding left prefrontal cortex and parietal   regions plus the medial temporal lobe. Thus, there   is some overlap in the brain areas activated  without visual awareness.

regions plus the medial temporal lobe. Thus, there 

is some overlap in the brain areas activated 
without visual awareness. Conscious percep-

tion was associated with activation in the 

mid-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA46) in the 

absence of any confounding with performance 

level. These ˚ ndings strengthen the argument 

that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is speci-

˚
 cally associated with conscious awareness.
The major limitation of the research 
discussed so far is that it is essentially cor-

rela
tional Œ visual consciousness is associated 

with certain patterns of brain activation. More 

direct evidence of the involvement of parietal 

and prefrontal cortex in visual consciousness can 

be obtained by applying transcranial magnetic 

stimulation (TMS) to those brain areas. Aware-

ness of visual change was impaired when TMS 

was applied to the right (but not the left) dorso-

lateral prefrontal cortex (Turatto, Sandrini, & 

Miniussi, 2004). Beck, Muggleton, Walsh, and 

Lavie (2006) used a task in which participants 

detected changes between two stimuli separated  

by a brief interval of time. TMS applied to 

right (but not left) parietal cortex reduced the 

number of changes detected.
More evidence of the involvement of frontal 
and parietal cortex in visual consciousness comes 

from individuals with neglect or extinction 

(see Chapter 5). Individuals with neglect have 

brain damage that prevents them from detecting  

visual stimuli presented to the side opposite the 

brain damage. The brain damage is typically

16CONSCIOUSNESS
619
One of the main assumptions of this theory is 
that we are only consciously aware of a small 

fraction of the information processing going 

on in our brain at any given moment. We 

generally become aware of information that is 

of most importance to us, for example, because  

it is connected to our current goals. Baars and 

Franklin (2007) used a theatre metaphor to 

clarify the nature of their global workspace 

theory. According to this metaphor, ﬁUnconscious  

processors in the theatre audience receive broad-

casts from a conscious ‚bright spot™ 
on the 

stage. Control of the bright spot corresponds  

to selective attentionﬂ (p. 957).
We will consider some of the main assump-
tions of global workspace theory in more detail. 

One major assumption is that there are very close 

links between consciousness and attention. For 

example, Baars (1997b) invited us to consider 

sentences such as, ﬁWe look in order to seeﬂ 

or ﬁWe listen in order to hearﬂ. According to 

Baars (1997b), ﬁThe distinction is between 

selecting an experience and being conscious of 

the selected event. In everyday language, the ˚
 rst 
word of each pair [ﬁlookﬂ, ﬁlistenﬂ] involves 

attention; the second word [ﬁseeﬂ, ﬁhearﬂ] 

involves consciousness.ﬂ Thus, attention re-

s e m bles choosing a television channel and con-

scious
ness resembles the picture on the screen.
A second assumption is that much human 
information processing involves a large number 

of special-purpose processors that are typically 

unconscious. These processors are distributed 

in numerous brain areas, with each processor 

carrying out specialised functions. For example, 

there are brain areas specialised for different 

aspects of vision such as colour and motion 

processing (see Chapter 2).
A third assumption is that, ﬁConscious con-
tents evoke widespread brain activationﬂ (Baars 

& Franklin, 2007, p. 956). What happens is that 

consciousness is associated "
Segment_1111,"with  integrating    information from several special-purpose pro-  cessors. Thus, unconscious processing gener-  ally involves several special-purpose processors    operating in relative isolation from each other,   whereas conscious processing involves integrated   brain activity across large area",Explores how emotion influences cognition.,"recognition, emotion, perception",Nested under Chapter on perception,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in attention,Aligned with contemporary studies on attention,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_1335,"with 
integrating
 

information from several special-purpose pro-

cessors. Thus, unconscious processing gener-

ally involves several special-purpose processors  

operating in relative isolation from each other, 

whereas conscious processing involves integrated 

brain activity across large areas of the brain.
during visual consciousness and when consciously 

thinking about past and future events.
Second, it is dif˚ cult to identify the precise 
cognitive processes associated with activation 

in prefrontal cortex and parietal cortex. For 

example, brain activation in those brain areas 

occurs when observers™ conscious percep-

tion switches from one stimulus to the other 

in binocular rivalry tasks or when a masked 

stimulus is identi˚
 ed. It is entirely possible that 
this brain activation re˜ ects changes in attention  

as well as changes in visual awareness. In other 

words, the functional roles of prefrontal and 

parietal cortex in visual awareness are unclear. 

However, as is discussed later, prefrontal cortex 

may play an important role in integrating infor-

mation from different brain areas to facilitate 

conscious perception.
Third, it is probably unwise to generalise 
to other species from the ˚ ndings on humans. 

The development of consciousness in humans 

presumably occurred as a product of natural 

selection, with the details varying from species 

to species. As a consequence, the brain areas 

associated with consciousness in other species 

may well differ from those associated with 

consciousness in humans.
THEORIES OF 
CONSCIOUSNESS
Numerous theories of consciousness have been 
proposed over the years, and we will consider 

only a few of the most important ones here. 

In recent years, there has been a large increase 

in the number of theories focusing on the brain 

mechanisms associated with consciousness. 

We have already considered Lamme™s theory 

of consciousness, according to which recurrent 

processing is of crucial"
Segment_1112,"importance to conscious   awareness. Here, we will consider other major   theoretical approaches. Global workspace theory Baars (1988) and Baars and Franklin (2003,   2007) put forward a global workspace theory.  9781841695402_4_016.indd   619 9781841695402_4_016.indd   619 12/21/09   2:24:42 PM  1",Explores how awareness influences cognition.,"recognition, memory, emotion",Nested under Chapter on emotion,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in perception,Aligned with contemporary studies on perception,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_730," importance to conscious

There are two types of non-conscious process-

ing, depending on whether a lack of conscious 

awareness is due to insuf˚ cient bottom-up or 

insuf˚
 cient top-down processing.
Evidence: attention and consciousness
The theoretical assumption that conscious 

awareness depends on prior selective attention 

may seem reasonable, and is probably correct 

most of the time. However, there is increasing 

evidence that it is not always correct. As Lamme 

(2003a) pointed out, if we are consciously 

aware of all attended stimuli, then we might as 

well eliminate one of the two terms. He put 

forward an alternative (and controversial) view-

point in which 
consciousness can 
precede 
attention (see Figure 16.4). According to Lamme™s 

theory, the linkage between consciousness and 

attention is looser than is generally imagined.

Dehaene and NaccacheÕs theory
Dehaene and Naccache (2001) put forward 

a global workspace theory resembling Baars™ 

theoretical approach but going beyond it in 

identifying the main brain areas associated with 

conscious awareness. They argued that conscious 

awareness depends on simultaneous activation 

of several distant parts of the brain. The speci˚
 c 
brain areas involved depend in part on the 

content of the conscious experience. For example, 

conscious experience of a face involves suf˚
 cient 
activation in the fusiform face area (see Chapter 

3), whereas conscious experi"

 within the middle temporal area. 
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) applied 

to that area prevented the conscious perception 

of motion (Walsh, Ellison, Battelli, & Cowey, 

1998). Dehaene and Naccache (2001) assumed 

that the brain areas involved in the global 

workspace and conscious experience include 

parts of the prefrontal cortex (e.g., BA46) and 

the anterior cingulate, as well as various content-

speci˚
 c areas (see Figure 16.3). BA46 (which 
forms an important part of the dorsolateral 

prefrontal cortex) and the anterior cingulate 

are both much involved in problem solving (see 

Chapter 12) and reasoning (see Chapter 14).
This theory was developed by Dehaene, 
Changeux, Naccache, Sackur, and Sergent (2006). 

They identi˚ ed three major states that can occur 

when a visual stimulus is presented:
Conscious state
(1) 
: There is much activation 
in areas involved in basic visual processing,  
and neurons in parietal, prefrontal, and 

cingulate cortex associated with attention 

are also activated.

Preconscious state
(2) 
: There is suf˚
 cient basic
 
visual processing to permit conscious aware-

ness but there is insuf˚
 cient top-down 
attention.

Subliminal state
(3) 
: There is insuf˚
 cient basic
 
visual processing to permit conscious aware-

ness regardless of the involvement of 

attention.
In other words, conscious visual awareness 
requires basic visual processing (bottom-up

Koch and Tsuchiya (2007) agreed with 
Lamme (2003) that attention and conscious-
ness are distinct phenomena. They argued that 

attention (speci˚ cally, top-down, goal-driven 

attention) fulfils different functions from 

consciousness and so cannot be regarded as 

the same. More speci˚ cally, top-down attention  

selects some aspect of the stimulus input de˚
 ned 
by location in space, a given feature (e.g., square 

shape), or by an object. In contrast, the functions 

of consciousness ﬁinclude summarising all infor-

mation that pertains to the current state of the 

organism and its environment and ensuring this 

compact summary is accessible to the planning 

areas of the brain, and also detecting anomalies 

and errors, decision making, language, inferring 

the internal state of other animals, setting long-

term goals, making recursive models and rational  

thoughtﬂ (Koch & Tsuchiya, 2007, p. 17).
Lamme (2003) and Koch and Tsuchiya 
(2007) agree that consciousness without atten-

tion is possible. Koch and Tsuchiya also claim 

that attention without consciousness is possible. 

Below we focus on these two predictions.
Evidence suggesting that it is possible for 
conscious awareness to exist in the absence of 

attention was reported by Landman, Spekreijse,  

and Lamme (2003), in a study on change blind-

ness discussed in Chapter 4.
Evidence from several kinds of experiment 
indicates that attention can in˜
 uence behaviour 
in the absence of consciousness. For example, 

Jiang, Costello, Fang, Huang, and He (2006) 

presented pictures of male and female nudes 

that were completely invisible to the participants 
erased and forgottenﬂ (Lamme, 2003a, p. 13).

Most of the time, however, the ticking is at

invisible digit, but did so without producing 
conscious awareness of that digit.
Evidence: unconscious special-purpose 
processors
There is plentiful evidence that considerable 
information processing can occur in the absence 

of conscious awareness. For example, consider 

conscious visual awareness. Much visual pro-

cessing occurs in brain areas that are to some 

extent specialised for colour processing and 

motion processing (see Chapter 2). However, 

as Tononi and Koch (2008, p. 253) pointed out, 

ﬁYou cannot experience visual shapes inde-

pendently of their colour, or perceive the left 

half of the visual ˚ eld independently of the right 

half.ﬂ These ˚ ndings suggest that the outputs 

of the specialised visual-processing areas are 

initially unconscious.
The notion that much "
Segment_1116,"information process- ing occurs without conscious awareness is also   supported by much of the research on brain-  damaged patients we have discussed through-  out this book. Examples include achromatopsia   and blindsight (see Chapter 2), prosopagnosia   (see Chapter 4), neglect and extinction (see",Explores how memory influences cognition.,"awareness, recognition, perception",Nested under Chapter on memory,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in awareness,Aligned with contemporary studies on attention,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_157,"information process-
ing occurs without conscious awareness is also 

supported by much of the research on brain-

damaged patients we have discussed through-

out this book. Examples include achromatopsia 

and blindsight (see Chapter 2), prosopagnosia 

(see Chapter 4), neglect and extinction (see 

Chapter 5), and amnesia (see Chapter 7).
Evidence: consciousness involves 
integrated brain functioning
The notion that integrated brain functioning 
is crucial to conscious awareness is an appealing 

one. One reason is because what we are con-

sciously aware of is nearly always integrated 

information. For example, as Tononi and Koch  

(2008) indicated, it is almost impossible to 

perceive an object while ignoring its colour or 

to perceive only part of the visual ˚
 eld.
Earlier we discussed a study by McIntosh 
et al. (1999). They found that conscious visual 

awareness seemed to be associated with an 

integrated network of brain areas, including the 

prefrontal cortex, occipital cortex, cerebellum, 

and superior temporal cortex. Similar ˚
 ndings 
were reported by Rodriguez et al. (1999). Parti-

cipants saw pictures that were easily perceived 

as faces when presented upright but which 

were seen as meaningless black-and-white 
because of continuous ˜ ash suppression. In spite 

of their invisibility, these pictures in˜
 uenced 
participants™ attentional processes. The attention 

of heterosexual males was attracted to invisible 

female nudes, and that of heterosexual females 

to invisible male nudes. Gay males had a tendency 

to attend to the location of nude males, and 

gay/bisexual females™ attentional preferences 

were between those of heterosexual males and 

females.
Evidence that attentional processes can

conscious awareness was reported by Naccache, 

Blandin, and Dehaene (2002; see Chapter 2).

Dehaene et al. (2006) argued that prefrontal,

of special importance to conscious awareness. 

We have discussed much evidence in this chapter 

that is generally supportive of that argument.

 y 
mention three limitations of most of the research. 

First, functional neuroimaging has established 

that a brain area such as dorsolateral prefrontal 

cortex is associated with conscious awareness, 

but that does not show that it is necessarily 

involved. Second, there is only partial overlap 

in the central brain areas identi˚
 ed in different 
studies. For example, numerous studies have 

implicated the prefrontal cortex in conscious 

awareness, but the precise parts of the prefrontal 

cortex activated vary from study to study. Third, 

much is known about the neural correlates of 

visual awareness or consciousness but we need 

more research before it is clear whether the 

same brain areas are associated with other 

forms of conscious awareness.
Overall evaluation
There is reasonable support for all of the major 

assumptions of both global workspace theories. 

It is probably true that selective attention 

typically precedes conscious awareness, that 

we remain unaware of much processing 

within specialised processing systems, and that 
shapes when presented upside-down. EEG was 

recorded from 30 electrodes, and the resultant 

data were then analysed to work out the extent 

to which electrical activity was in synchrony 

across electrodes (phase synchrony: co-ordinated 

activity in several different brain areas). The 

key ˚ ndings related to brain activity at the time 

after picture presentation (180 Œ360 ms) at which 

faces were perceived in the upright condition. 

There was considerable phase synchrony in 

this condition, especially in the area between 

the left parieto-occipital and frontotemporal 

regions (see Figure 16.6). In contrast, there was 

phase desynchrony rather than synchrony when 

no face was seen. Thus, integrated, synchronised  

activity across large areas of the cortex was 

associated with conscious awareness in the 

sense of coherent perception of the face. "

second conscious entity that is characteristi-
cally human and runs along in parallel with 

the more dominant stream of consciousness in 

the major hemisphere [the left one]ﬂ (Sperry, 

1968, p. 723). He regarded the left hemisphere 

as the dominant one because language processing 

typically occurs in that hemisphere.
On the other side of the argument are 
Gazzaniga, Ivry, and Mangun (2002). According  

to them, split-brain patients have only a single 

conscious system, based in the left hemisphere, 

that tries to make sense of the information avail-

able to it. This system is called the interpreter, 

de˚
 ned as ﬁA left-brain system that seeks explan-
ation for internal and external events in order 

to produce appropriate response behaviourﬂ 

(p. G-5). Cooney and Gazzaniga (2003) devel-

oped this "
Segment_1120,"theoretical position. They argued that   the interpretive process continues to function even   when provided with very limited information,   as occurs with many brain-damaged patients.   In their own words, ﬁThis [system] generates a    causal understanding of events that is subjectively   complete",Explores how memory influences cognition.,"perception, emotion, awareness",Nested under Chapter on attention,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in recognition,Aligned with contemporary studies on perception,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_278,"theoretical position. They argued that 

the interpretive process continues to function even 

when provided with very limited information, 

as occurs with many brain-damaged patients. 

In their own words, ﬁThis [system] generates a  

causal understanding of events that is subjectively 

complete and seemingly self-evident, even when 

that understanding is incompleteﬂ (p. 162).
Evidence
We will start by considering the subjective experi-

ence of split-brain patients. According to Colvin 

and Gazzaniga (2007, p. 189), ﬁNo split-brain 

patient has ever woken up following callostomy 

[cutting of the corpus callosum] and felt as 

though his/her experience of self had funda-

mentally changed or that two selves now 

inhabited the same body.ﬂ
In order to understand the ˚
 ndings from 
split-brain patients, note that information from 

the left visual ˚ eld goes to the right hemisphere, 
conscious awareness is generally associated with 

widespread integrated brain activity. Finally, 

prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate, and areas 

within the parietal cortex are more associated 

with consciousness than other brain areas.
What are the limitations of global work-
space theories? First, there is some (admittedly 

controversial) evidence that conscious aware-

ness can precede rather than follow selective 

attention. Second, identifying the brain areas 

associated with conscious awareness is not the 

same as having an adequate theory of conscious-

ness. 
Third, the great majority of the research 
has considered only visual consciousness, and so  

the applicability of global workspace theories to  

other forms of conscious awareness remains to  

be assessed. Fourth, we still do not really know 

whether integrated brain functioning is more 

a cause or a consequence of conscious awareness. 

It could be argued that it is less theoretically 

important if it is only a consequence.
IS CONSCIOUSNESS 
UNITARY?
Most people believe that they have a single, "
Segment_1121,"unitary consciousness, although a few are   in two minds on the issue. However, consider   split-brain patients , who have few connections  between the two brain hemispheres as a result   of surgery.

unitary consciousness, although a few are 

in two minds on the issue. However, consider 

split-brain patients
, who have few connections 
between the two brain hemispheres as a result 

of surgery. In the great majority of cases, the 

corpus callosum (bridge) between the two brain 

hemispheres was cut surgically to contain 

epileptic seizures within one hemisphere. The 

corpus callosum is a collection of 250 million 

axons connecting sites in one hemisphere with 

sites in the other. Do split-brain patients have 

two minds, each with its own consciousness?
Contrasting answers to the above question 
have been offered by experts in the ˚ eld. On one 

side of the argument is Roger Sperry (1913
Œ1994), 
who won the Nobel Prize for his in˜
 uential 
research on split-brain patients. He was ˚
 rmly 
of the opinion that these patients do have two 

consciousnesses: ﬁEach hemisphere seemed to  

have its own separate and private sensations...the

split-brain patients:
 these are patients in 
whom most of the direct links between the two 

hemispheres have been severed; as a result, they 

can experience problems in co-ordinating their 

processing and behaviour.

current mood, and so on. There were some 
interesting differences between Paul™s hemi-

spheres. For example, his right hemisphere said 

he wanted to be a racing driver, whereas his 

left hemisphere wanted to be a draughtsman.
Gazzaniga (1992) discussed other studies 
on Paul S. For example, a chicken claw was 

presented to his left hemisphere and a snow 

scene to his right hemisphere. Paul S was then 

asked to choose relevant pictures from an 

array. He chose a picture of a chicken with his

argued that Paul S™s left hemisphere was inter-

preting actions initiated by the right hemi-

sphere, with the right hemisphere contributing 

relatively little to the interpretation. Similarly, 

Paul S obeyed when his right hemisphere was 

given the command to walk. However, his left 

hemisphere explained his behaviour by saying 

something such as that he wanted a Coke.
Gazzaniga et al. (2002) reviewed other 
studies on split-brain patients indicating that 

they have very limited right-hemisphere 

consciousness. For example, their right hemi-

spheres can understand words such as ﬁpinﬂ 

and ﬁ˚ ngerﬂ, but ˚ nd it very hard to decide 

which of six words best describes the causal 

relationship between them (ﬁbleedﬂ). According  

to Gazzaniga et al. (p. 680), ﬁThe left hemi-

sphere . . . is constantly . . . labelling experiences, 

making inferences as to cause, and carrying 

out a host of other cognitive activities. The right 

hemisphere is simply monitoring the world.ﬂ
Baynes and Gazzaniga (2000) discussed the 
case of VJ, a split-brain patient whose writing 

is controlled by the right hemisphere whereas 

her speech is controlled by the left hemisphere. 

According to Baynes and Gazzaniga (p. 1362), 
whereas information from the right visual ˚

goes to the left hemisphere (see Chapter 2). 

More generally, the left half of the body is 

controlled by the right hemisphere and the

the environment reaches both hemispheres by 

moving their eyes around. Impaired perform-

ance in split-brain patients is produced by 

presenting visual stimuli brie˜ y to only one 

hemisphere so there are no eye movements 

while the stimuli are visible.
Trevarthen (2004) discussed studies com-
paring the abilities of the two hemispheres 

in split-brain patients. The right hemisphere 

outperformed the left one on tasks involving 

visual or touch perception of complex shapes, 

manipulations of geometric patterns, and judge-

ments involving hand explorations of shapes. 

In contrast, the left hemisphere was much better 

than the right hemisphere at tasks involving 

language. When language tasks were presented 

to the right hemisphere, ﬁThe subjects often 

gave no response. If urged to reply, they said 

that there might have been some weak and 

ill-defined event, or else they confabulated 

[invented] experiences, as if unable to apply a 

test of truth or falsity to spontaneously imag-

ined answers to questionsﬂ (p. 875).
The fact that the right hemisphere of most 
split-brain patients lacks speech makes it hard 

to know whether it possesses its own con-

sciousness. Accordingly, it is important to study 

split-brain patients with reasonable language 

abilities in the right hemisphere. Gazzaniga 

and Ledoux (1978) studied Paul S, a split-brain  

patient with unusually well-developed right-

hemisphere language abilities. Paul S showed 

limited evidence of consciousness in his right 

hemisphere by responding appropriately to 

questions using Scrabble letters with his left 

hand. For example, he could spell out his own 

name, that of his girlfriend, his hobbies, his

Gazzaniga (2000) studied a female patient with 

reduplicative paramnesia. She was studied at 

New York Hospital but was convinced she was 

at home in Freeport, Maine. When asked to 

explain why there were so many lifts outside 

the door, she replied, ﬁDo you know how much 

it cost me to have those put in?ﬂ
Patients with reduplicative paramnesia have 
substantial dif˚ culties in relating their stored 

memories with their actual experiences. There 

is evidence (reviewed by Feinberg and Keenan, 

2005) showing that such patients are more 

likely to have damage to the right hemisphere than 

to the left one. For example, 97% of patients had 

right-hemisphere damage in the frontal lobe 

compared to only 48% who had left-hemisphere 

damage in that lobe. Similar ˚ ndings were obtained 

when the focus was on 
the temporal or parietal  

lobes. These ˚
 ndings are 
consistent with the 
notion of a left-hemisphere 
interpretive system  

that has dif˚ culty in accessing 
information stored 
within the right hemisphere. Alternatively, dam-

age to the right h
emisphere 
may interfere more 
directly with conscious
 experience.
Evaluation
Research on split-brain patients has not fully 

resolved the issue of whether it is possible to 

have two separate consciousnesses. The com-

monest view is that the left hemisphere in 

split-brain patients plays the dominant role 

in consciousness, because it is the location of 

an interpreter or self-supervisory system pro-

viding coherent (but sometimes inaccurate) 

interpretations 
of events. In contrast, the right

we could interpret the evidence from VJ as 

suggesting limited dual consciousness.
Uddin, Rayman, and Zaidel (2005) pointed 
out that the ability to recognise one™s own face 

has often been regarded as an indication of 

reasonable self-awareness. They presented NG, 

a 70-year-old split-brain patient, with pictures 

representing different percentages of her own 

face and that of an unfamiliar face. The key 

˚
 nding was that she could recognise her own 
face equally well whether it was presented to 

her left or right hemisphere. Her self-recognition 

performance was only slightly worse than 

that of healthy individuals in a previous study, 

and suggests the existence of some basic self-

awareness in both hemispheres.
The notion that the right hemisphere plays 
an important role in self-awareness and thus 

perhaps in consciousness generally has received 

support from studies on healthy participants. 

A review of neuroimaging studies by Keenan and 

Gorman (2007) indicated that self-awareness 

is generally associated with greater right hemi-

sphere than left hemisphere activation. The 

limitation with such evidence is that it is only 

correlational. However, similar ˚
 ndings were 
reported by Guise et al. (2007) using TMS. TMS 

applied to the right prefrontal cortex disrupted 

self-perspective taking in healthy participants, 

whereas it had no effect on other-perspective 

taking. These various ˚ ndings suggest that con-

scious experience may depend more on the right 

hemisphere than was assumed by Gazzaniga 

et al. (2002).

ness. This view is supported by ˚
 nd-
ings showing the left hemisphere over-ruling the 
right hemisphere, and by the persistent failure 

to observe a genuine dialogue between the two 

hemispheres. It could also be very disruptive 

if each hemisphere had its own consciousness 

because of potential con˜
 icts between them. 
However, we lack de˚
 nitive evidence.
It appears that the right hemisphere exhibits  
self-recognition and so may exhibit some self-
awareness (Keenan & Gorman, 2007; Uddin 

et al., 2005). Colvin and Gazzaniga (2007, 

p. 189) came to the following conclusion: ﬁLeft 

hemisphere consciousness may be considered 

superior to that of the right hemisphere. How-

ever, the right hemisphere has some conscious 

experience accessible through non-verbal means.ﬂ 

It is possible that the contribution of the right 

hemisphere to conscious experience is greater 

than is implied by this conclusion.
 Introduction
† 
In order to understand consciousness, we need to consider the nature of conscious experi-

ence, access to information in consciousness, and self-knowledge. The claimed functions 

of consciousness include the social one of making it easier for us to predict and understand 

other people, disseminate and exchange information, and exercise global control. It is 

often argued that a major function of consciousness is to control our actions. In fact, 

however, there is increasing evidence from cognitive neuroscience that some of our deci-

sions are prepared preconsciously in the brain some time before we are consciously aware 

of"
Segment_1127,"the decision.   Measuring conscious experience †  Conscious awareness has typically been assessed by behavioural measures (e.g., verbal   reports; yes/no decisions). A major problem is that failure to report a given conscious   experience may be due to failures of attention, memory, or inner speech",Explores how perception influences cognition.,"awareness, memory, perception",Nested under Chapter on recognition,Observed data trends suggest strong effect in awareness,Aligned with contemporary studies on recognition,Used in agent decision-making systems for adaptive learning.,Related to Segment_840," the decision.
 
Measuring conscious experience
† 
Conscious awareness has typically been assessed by behavioural measures (e.g., verbal 

reports; yes/no decisions). A major problem is that failure to report a given conscious 

experience may be due to failures of attention, memory, or inner speech rather than to 

absence of the relevant conscious experience. Lamme argued that we should focus on 

neural correlates of consciousness. He argued that conscious experience is associated with 

recurrent processing rather than the feedforward sweep, but it is unlikely that recurrent 

processing is 
always
 associated with conscious experience.
 Brain areas associated with consciousness
† 
Research using various paradigms (e.g., masking; binocular rivalry) has indicated that the 

processing of stimuli that are not consciously perceived is often associated with modest 

brain activation in most areas of visual cortex. However, areas within the prefrontal and 

parietal cortex are typically activated only during processing of stimuli that are consciously
 
perceived. The precise functional roles of these brain regions in visual awareness are still 

unclear, but they may be involved in integrating information from various brain areas.
 Theories of consciousness
† 
According to global workspace theories, selective attention helps to determine the infor-

mation of which we become aware. Another key assumption is that conscious awareness 

is associated with integrated, synchronous activity involving many brain areas, especially 

prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate, and parts of the parietal cortex. There is reasonable 
support for all the major assumptions of global workspace theories. However
, there is

a consequence of conscious awareness.
